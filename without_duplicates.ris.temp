N2  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become the preferred method for global quantification of bacterial gene expression. With the continued improvements in sequencing technology and data analysis tools, the most labor-intensive and expensive part of an RNA-seq experiment is the preparation of sequencing libraries, which is also essential for the quality of the data obtained. Here, we present a straightforward and inexpensive basic protocol for preparation of strand-specific RNA-seq libraries from bacterial RNA as well as a computational pipeline for the data analysis of sequencing reads. The protocol is based on the Illumina platform and allows easy multiplexing of samples and the removal of sequencing reads that are PCR duplicates. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

N2  - Emerging evidence suggests that small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have malfunctioning roles in oncogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the role of box C/D small nucleolar RNA U2_19 (snoU2_19) in the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, we screened snoRNAs differential signatures by performing high-throughput small RNA sequence in HCC tissues and validated that upregulated snoU2_19 was associated with aggressive phenotypes in HCC patients. Aberrant snoU2_19 facilitated HCC cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis and induced cell cycle progression in vitro analyses. We globally investigated the molecular mechanisms of snoU2_19 in HCC and found that snoU2_19 knockdown inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through inducing the translocation of β-catenin in cytoplasm. We concluded that snoU2_19 plays a pathological role in the development and progression of HCC, and is a potential therapeutic target for HCC. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential metabolic cofactor used by around 4% of cellular enzymes. Its role is to carry and transfer acetyl and acyl groups to other molecules. Cells can synthesize CoA de novo from vitamin B5 (pantothenate) through five consecutive enzymatic steps. Phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPCS) catalyzes the second step of the pathway during which phosphopantothenate reacts with ATP and cysteine to form phosphopantothenoylcysteine. Inborn errors of CoA biosynthesis have been implicated in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), a group of rare neurological disorders characterized by accumulation of iron in the basal ganglia and progressive neurodegeneration. Exome sequencing in five individuals from two unrelated families presenting with dilated cardiomyopathy revealed biallelic mutations in PPCS, linking CoA synthesis with a cardiac phenotype. Studies in yeast and fruit flies confirmed the pathogenicity of identified mutations. Biochemical analysis revealed a decrease in CoA levels in fibroblasts of all affected individuals. CoA biosynthesis can occur with pantethine as a source independent from PPCS, suggesting pantethine as targeted treatment for the affected individuals still alive. © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics

N2  - Background: Feed intake and body weight gain are economically important inputs and outputs of beef production systems. The purpose of this study was to discover differentially expressed genes that will be robust for feed intake and gain across a large segment of the cattle industry. Transcriptomic studies often suffer from issues with reproducibility and cross-validation. One way to improve reproducibility is by integrating multiple datasets via meta-analysis. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on longissimus dorsi muscle from 80 steers (5 cohorts, each with 16 animals) selected from the outside fringe of a bivariate gain and feed intake distribution to understand the genes and pathways involved in feed efficiency. In each cohort, 16 steers were selected from one of four gain and feed intake phenotypes (n = 4 per phenotype) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with gain and feed intake as main effect variables. Each cohort was analyzed as a single experiment using a generalized linear model and results from the 5 cohort analyses were combined in a meta-analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) across the cohorts. Results: A total of 51 genes were differentially expressed for the main effect of gain, 109 genes for the intake main effect, and 11 genes for the gain x intake interaction (Pcorrected &lt; 0.05). A jackknife sensitivity analysis showed that, in general, the meta-analysis produced robust DEGs for the two main effects and their interaction. Pathways identified from over-represented genes included mitochondrial energy production and oxidative stress pathways for the main effect of gain due to DEG including GPD1, NDUFA6, UQCRQ, ACTC1, and MGST3. For intake, metabolic pathways including amino acid biosynthesis and degradation were identified, and for the interaction analysis the pathways identified included GADD45, pyridoxal 5'phosphate salvage, and caveolar mediated endocytosis signaling. Conclusions: Variation among DEG identified by cohort suggests that environment and breed may play large roles in the expression of genes associated with feed efficiency in the muscle of beef cattle. Meta-analyses of transcriptome data from groups of animals over multiple cohorts may be necessary to elucidate the genetics contributing these types of biological phenotypes. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Analysis of de novo mutations (DNMs) from sequencing data of nuclear families has identified risk genes for many complex diseases, including multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Most of these efforts have focused on mutations in protein-coding sequences. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) strongly suggests that variants important to human diseases often lie in non-coding regions. Extending DNM-based approaches to non-coding sequences is challenging, however, because the functional significance of non-coding mutations is difficult to predict. We propose a statistical framework for analyzing DNMs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This method, TADA-Annotations (TADA-A), is a major advance of the TADA method we developed earlier for DNM analysis in coding regions. TADA-A is able to incorporate many functional annotations such as conservation and enhancer marks, to learn from data which annotations are informative of pathogenic mutations, and to combine both coding and non-coding mutations at the gene level to detect risk genes. It also supports meta-analysis of multiple DNM studies, while adjusting for study-specific technical effects. We applied TADA-A to WGS data of ∼300 autism-affected family trios across five studies and discovered several autism risk genes.

N2  - Late blight caused by the oomycete fungus Phytophthora infestans (Pi) is the most serious obstacle to potato (Solanum tuberosum) production in the world. A super race isolate, CN152, which was identified from Sichuan Province, China, could overcome nearly all known late blight resistance genes and caused serious damage in China. The potato genotype SD20 was verified to be highly resistant to CN152; however, the molecular regulation network underlying late blight resistance pathway remains unclear in SD20. Here, we performed a time-course experiment to systematically profile the late blight resistance response genes using RNA-sequencing in SD20. We identified 3354 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which mainly encoded transcription factors and protein kinases, and also included four NBS-LRR genes. The late blight responsive genes showed time-point-specific induction/repression. Multi-signaling pathways of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene signaling pathways involved in resistance and defense against Pi in SD20. Gene Ontology and KEGG analyses indicated that the DEGs were significantly enriched in metabolic process, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Forty-three DEGs were involved in immune response, of which 19 were enriched in hypersensitive response reaction, which could play an important role in broad-spectrum resistance to Pi infection. Experimental verification confirmed the induced expression of the responsive genes in the late blight resistance signaling pathway, such as WRKY, ERF, MAPK, and NBS-LRR family genes. Our results provided valuable information for understanding late blight resistance mechanism of potato. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - The dynamic process involving the selection and maturation of follicles is regulated and controlled by a highly synchronized and exquisitely timed cascade of gene expression. Studies have shown that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is essential for the normal maintenance of animal reproductive function and has an important regulatory function in ovarian development and hormone secretion. In this study, a total of 2076 lncRNAs (1362 known lncRNAs and 714 new lncRNAs) and 25,491 mRNAs were identified in libraries constructed from Duroc ovaries on days 0, 2 and 4 of follicle development. lncRNAs were shorter, had fewer exons, exhibited a shorter ORF (Open Reading Frame) length and lower expression levels, and were less conserved than mRNAs. Furthermore, 1694 transcripts (140 lncRNAs and 1554 mRNAs) were found to be differentially expressed in pairwise comparisons. A total of 6945 co-localized mRNAs were detected in cis in 2076 lncRNAs. The most enriched GO (Gene Ontology) terms were related to developmental processes. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed lncRNAs targeted mRNAs, and the differentially expressed mRNAs were related to the TGF-β signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the Retinol metabolic pathway and the Wnt signaling pathway. This study deepened our understanding of the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of follicular development in pigs. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus of swine. PRV has a large double-stranded DNA genome and, as the latest investigations have revealed, a very complex transcriptome. Here, we present a large RNA-Seq dataset, derived from both short-A nd long-read sequencing. The dataset contains 1.3 million 100 bp paired-end reads that were obtained from the Illumina random-primed libraries, as well as 10 million 50 bp single-end reads generated by the Illumina polyA-seq. The Pacific Biosciences RSII non-amplified method yielded 57,021 reads of inserts (ROIs) aligned to the viral genome, the amplified method resulted in 158,396 PRV-specific ROIs, while we obtained 12,555 ROIs using the Sequel platform. The Oxford Nanopore's MinION device generated 44,006 reads using their regular cDNA-sequencing method, whereas 29,832 and 120,394 reads were produced by using the direct RNA-sequencing and the Cap-selection protocols, respectively. The raw reads were aligned to the PRV reference genome (KJ717942.1). Our provided dataset can be used to compare different sequencing approaches, library preparation methods, as well as for validation and testing bioinformatic pipelines. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Recent single-cell RNA-seq protocols based on droplet microfluidics use massively multiplexed barcoding to enable simultaneous measurements of transcriptomes for thousands of individual cells. The increasing complexity of such data creates challenges for subsequent computational processing and troubleshooting of these experiments, with few software options currently available. Here, we describe a flexible pipeline for processing droplet-based transcriptome data that implements barcode corrections, classification of cell quality, and diagnostic information about the droplet libraries. We introduce advanced methods for correcting composition bias and sequencing errors affecting cellular and molecular barcodes to provide more accurate estimates of molecular counts in individual cells. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Interpretation of next-generation sequencing constitutes the main limitation of molecular diagnostics. In diagnosing myopathies and muscular dystrophies, another issue is efficiency in predicting the pathogenicity of variants identified in large genes, especially TTN; current in silico prediction tools show limitations in predicting and ranking the numerous variants of such genes. We propose a variant-prioritization tool, the MoBiDiC prioritization algorithm (MPA). MPA is based on curated interpretation of data on previously reported variants, biological assumptions, and splice and missense predictors, and is used to prioritize all types of single-nucleotide variants. MPA was validated by comparing its sensitivity and specificity to those of dbNSFP database prediction tools, using a data set composed of DYSF, DMD, LMNA, NEB, and TTN variants extracted from expert-reviewed and ExAC databases. MPA obtained the best annotation rates for missense and splice variants. As MPA aggregates the results from several predictors, individual predictor errors are counterweighted, improving the sensitivity and specificity of missense and splice variant predictions. We propose a sequential use of MPA, beginning with the selection of variants with higher scores and followed by, in the absence of candidate pathologic variants, consideration of variants with lower scores. We provide scripts and documentation for free academic use and a validated annotation pipeline scaled for panel and exome sequencing to prioritize single-nucleotide variants from a VCF file. © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was the clinical and molecular characterization of a family segregating a trait consisting of a phenotype specifically involving the maxillary canines, including agenesis, impaction and ectopic eruption, characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Design: Clinical standardized assessment of 14 family members and a whole-exome sequencing (WES) of three affected subjects were performed. WES data analyses (sequence alignment, variant calling, annotation and prioritization) were carried out using an in-house implemented pipeline. Variant filtering retained coding and splice-site high quality private and rare variants. Variant prioritization was performed taking into account both the disruptive impact and the biological relevance of individual variants and genes. Sanger sequencing was performed to validate the variants of interest and to carry out segregation analysis. Results: Prioritization of variants “by function” allowed the identification of multiple variants contributing to the trait, including two concomitant heterozygous variants in EDARADD (c.308C>T, p.Ser103Phe) and COL5A1 (c.1588G>A, p.Gly530Ser), specifically associated with a more severe phenotype (i.e. canine agenesis). Differently, heterozygous variants in genes encoding proteins with a role in the WNT pathway were shared by subjects showing a phenotype of impacted/ectopic erupted canines. Conclusions: This study characterized the genetic contribution underlying a complex trait consisting of isolated canine anomalies in a medium-sized family, highlighting the role of WNT and EDA cell signaling pathways in tooth development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Bats are highly diverse and ecologically valuable mammals. They serve as host to bacteria, viruses and fungi that are either beneficial or harmful to its colony as well as to other groups of cave organisms. The bacterial diversity of two bat guano samples, C1 and C2, from Cabalyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan, Philippines were investigated using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. V3-V4 hypervariable regions were amplified and then sequenced using Illumina MiSeq 250 PE system. Reads were processed using Mothur and QIIME pipelines and assigned 12,345 OTUs for C1 and 5,408 OTUs for C2. The most dominant OTUs in C1 belong to the Proteobacteria (61.7%), Actinobacteria (19.4%), Bacteroidetes (4.2%), Firmicutes (2.7%), Chloroflexi (2.5%), candidate phylum TM7 (2.3%) and Planctomycetes (1.9%) while Proteobacteria (61.7%) and Actinobacteria (34.9%) dominated C2. Large proportion of sequence reads mainly associated with unclassified bacteria indicated possible occurrence of novel bacteria in both samples. XRF spectrophotometric analyses of C1 and C2 guano revealed significant differences in the composition of both major and trace elements. C1 guano recorded high levels of Si, Fe, Mg, Al, Mn, Ti and Cu while C2 samples registered high concentrations of Ca, P, S, Zn and Cr. Community structure of the samples were compared with other published community profiling studies from Finland (SRR868695), Meghalaya, Northeast India (SRR1793374) and Maharashtra State, India (CGS). Core microbiome among samples were determined for comparison. Variations were observed among previously studied guano samples and the Cabalyorisa Cave samples were attributed to either bat sources or age of the guano. This is the first study on bacterial diversity of guano in the Philippines through high-throughput sequencing. © 2018 P. De Leon et al.

N2  - Background Genetic risk factors, intestinal microbiota and a dysregulated immune system contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We have previously demonstrated that dysfunction of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) and PTPN22 contributes to alterations of intestinal microbiota and the onset of chronic intestinal inflammation in vivo. Here, we investigated the influence of PTPN2 and PTPN22 gene variants on intestinal microbiota composition in IBD patients. Methods Bacterial DNA from mucosa-associated samples of 75 CD and 57 UC patients were sequenced using 16S rRNA sequencing approach. Microbial analysis, including alpha diversity, beta diversity and taxonomical analysis by comparing to PTPN2 (rs1893217) and PTPN22 (rs2476601) genotypes was performed in QIIME, the phyloseq R package and MaAsLin pipeline. Results In PTPN2 variant UC patients, we detected an increase in relative abundance of unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Lachnospiraceae families and reduction of Roseburia when compared to PTPN2 wild-type (WT) patients. Ruminoccocus was increased in PTPN22 variant UC patients. In CD patients with severe disease course, Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, unclassified Erysipelotrichaeceae, unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae families were reduced and Bacteroides were increased in PTPN2 WT carriers, while Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, and Erysipelotrichaeceae were reduced in PTPN22 WT patients when compared to patients with mild disease. In UC patients with severe disease, relative abundance of Lachnobacterium was reduced in PTPN2 and PTPN22 WT patients, Dorea was increased in samples from PTPN22 WT carriers and an unassigned genus from Ruminococcaceae gen. was increased in patients with PTPN2 variant genotype. Conclusions We identified that IBD-associated genetic risk variants, disease severity and the interaction of these factors are related to significant alterations in intestinal microbiota composition of IBD patients. © 2018 Yilmaz et al.

N2  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have various functions, including chromatin remodeling and the regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. However, few lncRNAs have been investigated comprehensively, with the majority being uncharacterized. In the present study, a bioinformatics pipeline was established to identify novel lncRNA sequences similar to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of protein-coding genes. These pairs of lncRNAs and coding genes contained the same microRNA (miRNA) target sites; the lncRNA CR933609 matched the 3′-UTR of INO80 complex subunit D (INO80D) mRNA. The expression levels of CR933609 and INO80D were significantly decreased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancer tissues. The expression levels of CR933609 and INO80D were decreased in CR933609-knockdown NSCLC cells, but only expression levels of INO80D decreased in INO80D knockdown cells. It was shown that there are independent promoters in CR933609 and INO80D. It was also found that the expression levels of INO80D were downregulated by endogenous miRNA-5096 in A549 cells, but not in CR933609-overexpressing A549 cells. Furthermore, the lncRNA CR933609 acted as a decoy to protect INO80D from downregulation by miRNA-5096 in NSCLC cells. A protocol was established to identify novel lncRNAs in the 3′-UTR and the existence of novel lncRNAs was confirmed. © 2018 Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.

N2  - This contribution sketches a work flow to design an RNA switch that is able to adapt two structural conformations in a ligand-dependent way. A well characterized RNA aptamer, i.e., knowing its K d and adaptive structural features, is an essential ingredient of the described design process. We exemplify the principles using the well-known theophylline aptamer throughout this work. The aptamer in its ligand-binding competent structure represents one structural conformation of the switch while an alternative fold that disrupts the binding-competent structure forms the other conformation. To keep it simple we do not incorporate any regulatory mechanism to control transcription or translation. We elucidate a commonly used design process by explicitly dissecting and explaining the necessary steps in detail. We developed a novel objective function which specifies the mechanistics of this simple, ligand-triggered riboswitch and describe an extensive in silico analysis pipeline to evaluate important kinetic properties of the designed sequences. This protocol and the developed software can be easily extended or adapted to fit novel design scenarios and thus can serve as a template for future needs. © 2018

N2  - Modern techniques of next-generation sequencing (NGS) allow obtaining expression profile of all genes and provide an essential basis for characterizing metabolism in the organism of interest on a broad scale. An important condition for obtaining a demonstrative physiological picture using high throughput sequencing data is the availability of the genome sequence and its sufficient annotation for the target organism. However, a list of species with properly annotated genomes is limited. Transcriptome profiling is often performed in the so-called non-model organisms, which are those with unknown or poorly assembled and/or annotated genome sequences. The transcriptomes of non-model organisms are possible to investigate using algorithms of de novo assembly of the transcripts from sequences obtained as the result of RNA sequencing. A physiological interpretation of the data is difficult in this case because of the absence of annotation of the assembled transcripts and their classification by metabolic pathway and functional category. An algorithm for transcriptome profiling in non-model organisms was developed, and a transcriptome analysis was performed for the basidiomycete Lentinus edodes. The algorithm includes open access software and custom scripts and encompasses a complete analysis pipeline from the selection of cDNA reads to the functional classification of differentially expressed genes and the visualization of the results. Based on this algorithm, a comparative transcriptome analysis of the nonpigmented mycelium and brown mycelial mat was performed in L. edodes. The comparison revealed physiological differences between the two morphogenetic stages, including an induction of cell wall biogenesis, intercellular communication, ion transport, and melanization in the brown mycelial mat. © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

N2  - Beneficial plant-associated bacteria play an important role in promoting growth and preventing disease in plants. The application of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) as biofertilizers or biocontrol agents has become an effective alternative to the use of conventional fertilizers and can increase crop productivity at low cost. Plant-microbe interactions depend upon host plant-secreted signals and a reaction hereon by their associated bacteria. However, the molecular mechanisms of how beneficial bacteria respond to their associated plant-derived signals are not fully understood. Assessing the transcriptomic response of bacteria to root exudates is a powerful approach to determine the bacterial gene expression and regulation under rhizospheric conditions. Such knowledge is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in plant-microbe interactions. This paper describes a detailed protocol to study the transcriptomic response of B. mycoides EC18, a strain isolated from the potato endosphere, to potato root exudates. With the help of recent high-throughput sequencing technology, this protocol can be performed in several weeks and produce massive datasets. First, we collect the root exudates under sterile conditions, after which they are added to B. mycoides cultures. The RNA from these cultures is isolated using a phenol/chloroform method combined with a commercial kit and subjected to quality control by an automated electrophoresis instrument. After sequencing, data analysis is performed with the web-based TREx pipeline and a group of differentially expressed genes is identified. This method is a useful tool to facilitate new discoveries on the bacterial genes involved in plant-microbe interactions. © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

N2  - Plant regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs), which include most microRNAs (miRNAs) and a subset of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), such as the phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs), play important roles in regulating gene expression. Although generated from genetically distinct biogenesis pathways, these regulatory sRNAs share the same mechanisms for posttranslational gene silencing and translational inhibition. psRNATarget was developed to identify plant sRNA targets by (i) analyzing complementary matching between the sRNA sequence and target mRNA sequence using a predefined scoring schema and (ii) by evaluating target site accessibility. This update enhances its analytical performance by developing a new scoring schema that is capable of discovering miRNA-mRNA interactions at higher 'recall rates' without significantly increasing total prediction output. The scoring procedure is customizable for the users to search both canonical and noncanonical targets. This update also enables transmitting and analyzing 'big' data empowered by (a) the implementation of multi-threading chunked file uploading, which can be paused and resumed, using HTML5 APIs and (b) the allocation of significantly more computing nodes to its back-end Linux cluster. The updated psRNATarget server has clear, compelling and user-friendly interfaces that enhance user experiences and present data clearly and concisely. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - The recent accumulation of gene expression data in the form of RNA sequencing creates unprecedented opportunities to study gene regulation and function. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the expression data from multiple species can elucidate which functional gene modules are conserved across species, allowing the study of the evolution of these modules. However, performing such comparative analyses on raw data is not feasible for many biologists. Here, we present CoNekT (Co-expression Network Toolkit), an open source web server, that contains user-friendly tools and interactive visualizations for comparative analyses of gene expression data and co-expression networks. These tools allow analysis and cross-species comparison of (i) gene expression profiles; (ii) co-expression networks; (iii) co-expressed clusters involved in specific biological processes; (iv) tissue-specific gene expression; and (v) expression profiles of gene families. To demonstrate these features, we constructed CoNekT-Plants for green alga, seed plants and flowering plants (Picea abies, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Vitis vinifera, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Zea mays and Solanum lycopersicum) and thus provide a web-tool with the broadest available collection of plant phyla.

N2  - Background: Alignment-free RNA quantification tools have significantly increased the speed of RNA-seq analysis. However, it is unclear whether these state-of-the-art RNA-seq analysis pipelines can quantify small RNAs as accurately as they do with long RNAs in the context of total RNA quantification. Result: We comprehensively tested and compared four RNA-seq pipelines for accuracy of gene quantification and fold-change estimation. We used a novel total RNA benchmarking dataset in which small non-coding RNAs are highly represented along with other long RNAs. The four RNA-seq pipelines consisted of two commonly-used alignment-free pipelines and two variants of alignment-based pipelines. We found that all pipelines showed high accuracy for quantifying the expression of long and highly-abundant genes. However, alignment-free pipelines showed systematically poorer performance in quantifying lowly-abundant and small RNAs. Conclusion: We have shown that alignment-free and traditional alignment-based quantification methods perform similarly for common gene targets, such as protein-coding genes. However, we have identified a potential pitfall in analyzing and quantifying lowly-expressed genes and small RNAs with alignment-free pipelines, especially when these small RNAs contain biological variations. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Integration of detailed phenotype information with genetic data is well established to facilitate accurate diagnosis of hereditary disorders. As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records (EHRs) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous EHR narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present EHR-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput EHR framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. EHR-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from EHR narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the HPO-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed EHR-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by EHR-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p &lt; 2.2 × 10 −16 ), supporting the value of phenotype-driven gene prioritization in diagnostic sequence interpretation. To assess the generalizability, we replicated this finding on an independent EHR dataset of ten individuals with a positive diagnosis from a different institution. We then assessed the broader utility by examining two additional EHR datasets, including 31 individuals who were suspected of having a Mendelian disease and underwent different types of genetic testing and 20 individuals with positive diagnoses of specific Mendelian etiologies of chronic kidney disease from exome sequencing. Finally, through several retrospective case studies, we demonstrated how combined analyses of genotype data and deep phenotype data from EHRs can expedite genetic diagnoses. In summary, EHR-Phenolyzer leverages EHR narratives to automate phenotype-driven analysis of clinical exomes or genomes, facilitating the broader implementation of genomic medicine. © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics

N2  - 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) can vary through the use of alternative polyadenylation sites during pre-mRNA processing. Multiple publically available pipelines combining high profiling technologies and bioinformatics tools have been developed to catalog changes in 3′-UTR lengths. In our recent RNA-seq experiments using cells with hyper-activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), we found that cellular mTOR activation leads to transcriptome-wide alternative polyadenylation (APA), resulting in the activation of multiple cellular pathways. Here, we developed a novel bioinformatics algorithm, IntMAP, which integrates RNA-Seq and PolyA Site (PAS)-Seq data for a comprehensive characterization of APA events. By applying IntMAP to the datasets from cells with hyper-activated mTOR, we identified novel APA events that could otherwise not be identified by either profiling method alone. Several transcription factors including Cebpg (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein gamma) were among the newly discovered APA transcripts, indicating that diverse transcriptional networks may be regulated by mTOR-coordinated APA. The prevention of APA in Cebpg using the CRISPR/cas9-mediated genome editing tool showed that mTOR-driven 3′-UTR shortening in Cebpg is critical in protecting cells from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Taken together, we present IntMAP as a new bioinformatics algorithm for APA analysis by which we expand our understanding of the physiological role of mTOR-coordinated APA events to ER stress response.

N2  - Background: An open challenge in translational bioinformatics is the analysis of sequenced metagenomes from various environmental samples. Of course, several studies demonstrated the 16S ribosomal RNA could be considered as a barcode for bacteria classification at the genus level, but till now it is hard to identify the correct composition of metagenomic data from RNA-seq short-read data. 16S short-read data are generated using two next generation sequencing technologies, i.e. whole genome shotgun (WGS) and amplicon (AMP); typically, the former is filtered to obtain short-reads belonging to a 16S shotgun (SG), whereas the latter take into account only some specific 16S hypervariable regions. The above mentioned two sequencing technologies, SG and AMP, are used alternatively, for this reason in this work we propose a deep learning approach for taxonomic classification of metagenomic data, that can be employed for both of them. Results: To test the proposed pipeline, we simulated both SG and AMP short-reads, from 1000 16S full-length sequences. Then, we adopted a k-mer representation to map sequences as vectors into a numerical space. Finally, we trained two different deep learning architecture, i.e., convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep belief network (DBN), obtaining a trained model for each taxon. We tested our proposed methodology to find the best parameters configuration, and we compared our results against the classification performances provided by a reference classifier for bacteria identification, known as RDP classifier. We outperformed the RDP classifier at each taxonomic level with both architectures. For instance, at the genus level, both CNN and DBN reached 91.3% of accuracy with AMP short-reads, whereas RDP classifier obtained 83.8% with the same data. Conclusions: In this work, we proposed a 16S short-read sequences classification technique based on k-mer representation and deep learning architecture, in which each taxon (from phylum to genus) generates a classification model. Experimental results confirm the proposed pipeline as a valid approach for classifying bacteria sequences; for this reason, our approach could be integrated into the most common tools for metagenomic analysis. According to obtained results, it can be successfully used for classifying both SG and AMP data. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Alternative polyadenylation (APA) results in messenger RNA molecules with different 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), affecting the molecules' stability, localization, and translation. APA is pervasive and implicated in cancer. Earlier reports on APA focused on 3' UTR length modifications and commonly characterized APA events as 3' UTR shortening or lengthening. However, such characterization oversimplifies the processing of 3' ends of transcripts and fails to adequately describe the various scenarios we observe. Results: We built a cloud-based targeted de novo transcript assembly and analysis pipeline that incorporates our previously developed cleavage site prediction tool, KLEAT. We applied this pipeline to elucidate the APA profiles of 114 genes in 9939 tumor and 729 tissue normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The full set of 10,668 RNA-Seq samples from 33 cancer types has not been utilized by previous APA studies. By comparing the frequencies of predicted cleavage sites between normal and tumor sample groups, we identified 77 events (i.e. gene-cancer type pairs) of tumor-specific APA regulation in 13 cancer types; for 15 genes, such regulation is recurrent across multiple cancers. Our results also support a previous report showing the 3' UTR shortening of FGF2 in multiple cancers. However, over half of the events we identified display complex changes to 3' UTR length that resist simple classification like shortening or lengthening. Conclusions: Recurrent tumor-specific regulation of APA is widespread in cancer. However, the regulation pattern that we observed in TCGA RNA-seq data cannot be described as straightforward 3' UTR shortening or lengthening. Continued investigation into this complex, nuanced regulatory landscape will provide further insight into its role in tumor formation and development. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Interest in single-cell transcriptomic analysis is growing rapidly, especially for profiling rare or heterogeneous populations of cells. In almost all reported works investigators have used live cells, which introduces cell stress during preparation and hinders complex study designs. Recent studies have indicated that cells fixed by denaturing fixative can be used in single-cell sequencing, however they did not usually work with most types of primary cells including immune cells. Methods: The methanol-fixation and new processing method was introduced to preserve human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis on 10× Chromium platform. Results: When methanol fixation protocol was broken up into three steps: fixation, storage and rehydration, we found that PBMC RNA was degraded during rehydration with PBS, not at cell fixation and up to 3-month storage steps. Resuspension but not rehydration in 3× saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer instead of PBS preserved PBMC RNA integrity and prevented RNA leakage. Diluted SSC buffer did not interfere with full-length cDNA synthesis. The methanol-fixed PBMCs resuspended in 3× SSC were successfully implemented into 10× Chromium standard scRNA-seq workflows with no elevated low quality cells and cell doublets. The fixation process did not alter the single-cell transcriptional profiles and gene expression levels. Major subpopulations classified by marker genes could be identified in fixed PBMCs at a similar proportion as in live PBMCs. This new fixation processing protocol also worked in several other fixed primary cell types and cell lines as in live ones. Conclusions: We expect that the methanol-based cell fixation procedure presented here will allow better and more effective batching schemes for a complex single cell experimental design with primary cells or tissues. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Since the proposal of Brachypodium distachyon as a model for the grasses, over 500 Bdi-miRNAs have been annotated in miRBase making Brachypodium second in number only to rice. Other monocots, such as switchgrass, are completely absent from the miRBase database. While a significant number of miRNAs have been identified which are highly conserved across plants, little research has been done with respect to the conservation of miRNA targets. Plant responses to abiotic stresses are regulated by diverse pathways many of which involve miRNAs; however, it can be difficult to identify miRNA guided gene regulation when the miRNA is not the primary regulator of the target mRNA. Results: To investigate miRNA target conservation and stress response involvement, a set of PARE (Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends) libraries totaling over two billion reads was constructed and sequenced from Brachypodium, switchgrass, and sorghum representing the first report of RNA degradome data from the latter two species. Analysis of this data provided not only PARE evidence for miRNA guided cleavage of over 7000 predicted target mRNAs in Brachypodium, but also evidence for miRNA guided cleavage of over 1000 homologous transcripts in sorghum and switchgrass. A pipeline was constructed to compare RNA-seq and PARE data made from Brachypodium plants exposed to various abiotic stress conditions. This resulted in the identification of 44 miRNA targets which exhibit stress regulated cleavage. Time course experiments were performed to reveal the relationship between miR393ab, miR169a, miR394ab, and their respective targets throughout the first 36 h of the cold stress response in Brachypodium. Conclusions: Knowledge gained from this study provides considerable insight into the RNA degradomes and the breadth of miRNA target conservation among these three species. Additionally, associations of a number of miRNAs and target mRNAs with the stress responses have been revealed which could aid in the development of stress tolerant transgenic crops. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - RNA-Seq technology has been gradually becoming a routine approach for characterizing the properties of transcriptome in terms of organisms, cell types and conditions and consequently a big burden has been put on the facet of data analysis, which calls for an easy-to-learn workflow to cope with the increased demands from a large number of laboratories across the world. We report a one-in-all solution called hppRNA, composed of four scenarios such as pre-mapping, core-workflow, post-mapping and sequence variation detection, written by a series of individual Perl and R scripts, counting on well-established and preinstalled software, irrespective of single-end or paired-end, unstranded or stranded sequencing method. It features six independent core-workflows comprising the state-of-the-art technology with dozens of popular cutting-edge tools such as Tophat-Cufflink-Cuffdiff, Subread-featureCounts-DESeq2, STAR-RSEM-EBSeq, Bowtie-eXpress-edgeR, kallisto-sleuth, HISAT-StringTie-Ballgown, and embeds itself in Snakemake, which is a modern pipeline management system. The core function of this pipeline is turning the raw fastq files into gene/isoform expression matrix and differentially expressed genes or isoforms as well as the identification of fusion genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms, long noncoding RNAs and circular RNAs. Last but not least, this pipeline is specifically designed for performing the systematic analysis on a huge set of samples in one go, ideally for the researchers who intend to deploy the pipeline on their local servers. The scripts as well as the user manual are freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/hpprna/.

N2  - Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are typically expressed at low levels and are inherently highly variable. This is a fundamental challenge for differential expression (DE) analysis. In this study, the performance of 25 pipelines for testing DE in RNA-seq data is comprehensively evaluated, with a particular focus on lncRNAs and low-abundance mRNAs. Fifteen performance metrics are used to evaluate DE tools and normalization methods using simulations and analyses of six diverse RNA-seq datasets. Results: Gene expression data are simulated using non-parametric procedures in such a way that realistic levels of expression and variability are preserved in the simulated data. Throughout the assessment, results for mRNA and lncRNA were tracked separately. All the pipelines exhibit inferior performance for lncRNAs compared to mRNAs across all simulated scenarios and benchmark RNA-seq datasets. The substandard performance of DE tools for lncRNAs applies also to low-abundance mRNAs. No single tool uniformly outperformed the others. Variability, number of samples, and fraction of DE genes markedly influenced DE tool performance. Conclusions: Overall, linear modeling with empirical Bayes moderation (limma) and a non-parametric approach (SAMSeq) showed good control of the false discovery rate and reasonable sensitivity. Of note, for achieving a sensitivity of at least 50%, more than 80 samples are required when studying expression levels in realistic settings such as in clinical cancer research. About half of the methods showed a substantial excess of false discoveries, making these methods unreliable for DE analysis and jeopardizing reproducible science. The detailed results of our study can be consulted through a user-friendly web application, giving guidance on selection of the optimal DE tool ( http://statapps.ugent.be/tools/AppDGE/ ). © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - This metagenome approach is used to identify plant viruses with circular DNA genomes and their transcripts. Often plant DNA viruses that occur in low titers in their host or cannot be mechanically inoculated to another host are difficult to propagate to achieve a greater titer of infectious material. Infected leaves are ground in a mild buffer with optimal pH and ionic composition recommended for purifying most bacilliform Para retroviruses. Urea is used to break up inclusion bodies that trap virions and to dissolve cellular components. Differential centrifugation provides further separation of virions from plant contaminants. Then proteinase K treatment removes the capsids. Then the viral DNA is concentrated and used for next-generation sequencing (NGS). The NGS data are used to assemble contigs which are submitted to NCBI-BLASTn to identify a subset of virus sequences in the generated dataset. In a parallel pipeline, RNA is isolated from infected leaves using a standard column-based RNA extraction method. Then ribosome depletion is carried out to enrich for a subset of mRNA and virus transcripts. Assembled sequences derived from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were submitted to NCBI-BLASTn to identify a subset of virus sequences in this dataset. In our study, we identified two related full-length badnavirus genomes in the two datasets. This method is preferred to another common approach which extracts the aggregate population of small RNA sequences to reconstitute plant virus genomic sequences. This latter metagenomic pipeline recovers virus related sequences that are retro-transcribing elements inserted into the plant genome. This is coupled to biochemical or molecular assays to further discern the actively infectious agents. The approach documented in this study, recovers sequences representative of replicating viruses that likely indicate active virus infection. © 2018 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

N2  - Conventional approaches for antiparasitic drug discovery center upon discovering selective agents that adversely impact parasites with minimal host side effects. Here, we show that agents with a broad polypharmacology, often considered ‘dirtier’ drugs, can have unique efficacy if they combine deleterious effects on the parasite with beneficial actions in the host. This principle is evidenced through a screen for drugs to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic flatworm disease that impacts over 230 million people. A target-based screen of a Schistosoma serotoninergic G protein coupled receptor yielded the potent agonist, ergotamine, which disrupted worm movement. In vivo, ergotamine decreased mortality, parasite load and intestinal egg counts but also uniquely reduced organ pathology through engagement of host GPCRs that repressed hepatic stellate cell activation, inflammatory damage and fibrosis. The unique ability of ergotamine to engage both host and parasite GPCRs evidences a future strategy for anthelmintic drug design that coalesces deleterious antiparasitic activity with beneficial host effects. © Chan et al.

N2  - Background: The field of small RNA is one of the most investigated research areas since they were shown to regulate transposable elements and gene expression and play essential roles in fundamental biological processes. Small RNA deep sequencing (sRNA-seq) is now routinely used for large-scale analyses of small RNA. Such high-throughput sequencing typically produces several millions reads. Results: Here we present a computational pipeline (sRNAPipe: small RNA pipeline) based on the Galaxy framework that takes as input a fastq file of small RNA-seq reads and performs successive steps of mapping to categories of genomic sequences: transposable elements, gene transcripts, microRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs. It also provides individual mapping and counting for chromosomes, transposable elements and gene transcripts, normalization, small RNA length analysis and plotting of the data along genomic coordinates to build publication-quality graphs and figures. sRNAPipe evaluates 10-nucleotide 5′-overlaps of reads on opposite strands to test ping-pong amplification for putative PIWI-interacting RNAs, providing counts of overlaps and corresponding z-scores. Conclusions: sRNAPipe is easy to use and does not require command-line or coding knowledge. This pipeline gives quick visual and quantitative results, which are usable for publications. sRNAPipe is freely available as a Galaxy tool and via GitHub. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide; however, the mutational properties of HCC-associated carcinogens remain largely uncharacterized. We hypothesized that mechanisms underlying chemical-induced HCC can be characterized by evaluating the mutational spectra of these tumors. To test this hypothesis, we performed exome sequencing of B6C3F1/N HCCs that arose either spontaneously in vehicle controls (n = 3) or due to chronic exposure to gingko biloba extract (GBE; n = 4) or methyleugenol (MEG; n = 3). Most archived tumor samples are available as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, rather than fresh-frozen (FF) samples; hence, exome sequencing from paired FF and FFPE samples was compared. FF and FFPE samples showed 63% to 70% mutation concordance. Multiple known (e.g., Ctnnb1T41A, BrafV637E) and novel (e.g., Erbb4C559S, Card10A700V, and Klf11P358L) mutations in cancer-related genes were identified. The overall mutational burden was greater for MEG than for GBE or spontaneous HCC samples. To characterize the mutagenic mechanisms, we analyzed the mutational spectra in the HCCs according to their trinucleotide motifs. The MEG tumors clustered closest to Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer signatures 4 and 24, which are, respectively, associated with benzo(a)pyrene- and aflatoxin-induced HCCs in humans. These results establish a novel approach for classifying liver carcinogens and understanding the mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinogenesis. © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis is a severe fatal disorder with an average incidence of around 1:250,000. It is diagnosed soon after birth or within the 1st year of life with severe symptoms of abnormal bone remodelling. This study was aimed to identify the underlying genetic cause of the disease in a Pakistani family segregating infantile malignant osteopetrosis in autosomal recessive pattern. Whole exome sequencing of the proband was performed using the 51 Mb SureSelect V4 library kit and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing system. The reads were analysed using standard bioinformatic data analysis pipeline. The genotype of candidate variants was confirmed in the proband and his normal parents by Sanger sequencing. Two novel homozygous missense variants were found in the same codon 204 of CLCN7 NM_001287.5:c.[610A>T;612C>G] predicting p.(Ser204Trp) variant in the protein. Sanger sequencing and RFLP assay verified that both these variants were heterozygous in the unaffected parents. Moreover, these variants were not detected in the unrelated healthy Pakistani subjects (200 chromosomes), ExAC, dbSNP, or the 1000 Genomes Project data. Multiple bioinformatics tools unanimously predicted the p.(Ser204Trp) variant as deleterious. CLCN7 mutation p.(Ser204Trp) is the likely cause of the osteopetrosis disease in the Pakistani family. This study expands the restricted spectrum of CLCN7 mutations associated with infantile malignant osteopetrosis and indicates clinical significance of whole exome sequencing in the diagnosis of clinically and genetically heterogenous osteopetrosis phenotype. These data should be helpful in the improved genetic counselling, carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the affected family. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Symbionts (e.g., endoparasites and commensals) play an integral role in their host's ecology, yet in many cases their diversity is likely underestimated. Although endoparasites are traditionally characterized using morphology, sequences of conserved genes, and shotgun metagenomics, host transcriptomes constitute an underused resource to identify these organisms’ diversity. By isolating non-host transcripts from host transcriptomes, individual host tissues can now simultaneously reveal their endoparasite species richness (i.e., number of different taxa) and provide insights into parasite gene expression. These approaches can be used in host taxa whose endoparasites are mostly unknown, such as those of tropical amphibians. Here, we focus on the poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) as hosts, which are a Neotropical clade known for their bright coloration and defensive alkaloids. These toxins are an effective protection against vertebrate predators (e.g., snakes and birds), bacteria, and skin-biting ectoparasites (e.g., mosquitoes); however, little is known about their deterrence against eukaryotic endoparasites. With de novo transcriptomes of dendrobatids, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline for endoparasite identification that uses host annotated RNA-seq data and set of a priori parasite taxonomic terms, which are used to mine for specific endoparasites. We found a large community of helminths and protozoans that were mostly restricted to the digestive tract and a few systemic parasites (e.g., Trypanosoma). Contrary to our expectations, all dendrobatid frogs regardless of the presence of alkaloid defenses have endoparasites, with their highest species richness located in the frog digestive tract. Some of these organisms (e.g., roundworms) might prove to be generalists, as they were not found to be co-diversifying with their frog hosts. We propose that endoparasites may escape poison frogs’ chemical defenses by colonizing tissues with fewer alkaloids than the frog's skin, where most toxins are stored. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Prompt identification of causative pathogenic bacteria is imperative for the treatment of patients suffering from infectious diseases, including sepsis and pneumonia. However, current culture-based methodologies have several drawbacks including their limitation of use to culturable bacterial species. To circumvent these problems, we attempted to detect bacterial DNA in blood using next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) technology. We conducted metagenomic and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing of DNA extracted from bacteria-spiked blood using an Ion Personal Genome Machine. NGS data was analyzed using our in-house pipeline Genome Search Toolkit and database GenomeSync. The metagenomic sequencing analysis successfully detected three grampositive and three gram-negative bacteria spiked in the blood, which was associated with a significant portion of non-bacterial reads, even though human blood cells were separated by low-speed centrifugation prior to DNA extraction. Sequencing analysis of seven variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon also successfully detected all six bacteria spiked in the blood. The methodology using 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis was verified using DNA from the blood of six patients with sepsis and four healthy volunteers with potential pathogenic bacteria in the blood being identified at the species level. These findings suggest that our system will be a potential platform for practical diagnosis in the future. Copyright © 2018 Watanabe et al.

N2  - The long noncoding RNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) has been shown to regulate multiple cancer-related cellular activities including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. In this study, we confirm that repression of NEAT1 induces DNA damage, disturbs the cell cycle, and arrests the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. By taking advantage of the prostate cancer tumor transcriptome profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas, our data-mining pipeline identified a series of transcription factors (TF) whose regulatory activities on target genes depended on the level of NEAT1. Among them was putative TF CDC5L, which bound directly to NEAT1. Silencing NEAT1 in prostate cancer cells repressed the transcriptional activity of CDC5L, and RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses further revealed a handful of potential targets of CDC5L regulated by NEAT1 expression. One target of CDC5L, ARGN, mediated the strong phenotypic consequences of NEAT1 reduction, including DNA damage, cell-cycle dysregulation, and proliferation arrest. In summary, we have established the requirement of the CDC5L–AGRN circuit for the essential oncogenic role of NEAT1 in prostate cancer cells. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  - Recursive splicing, a process by which a single intron is removed from pre-mRNA transcripts in multiple distinct segments, has been observed in a small subset of Drosophila melanogaster introns. However, detection of recursive splicing requires observation of splicing intermediates that are inherently unstable, making it difficult to study. Here we developed new computational approaches to identify recursively spliced introns and applied them, in combination with existing methods, to nascent RNA sequencing data from Drosophila S2 cells. These approaches identified hundreds of novel sites of recursive splicing, expanding the catalog of recursively spliced fly introns by 4-fold. A subset of recursive sites were validated by RT-PCR and sequencing. Recursive sites occur in most very long (> 40 kb) fly introns, including many genes involved in morphogenesis and development, and tend to occur near the midpoints of introns. Suggesting a possible function for recursive splicing, we observe that fly introns with recursive sites are spliced more accurately than comparably sized non-recursive introns. © 2018 Pai et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

N2  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows researchers to profile the transcriptomes of thousands of cells simultaneously. Protocols that incorporate both designed and random barcodes have greatly increased the throughput of scRNA-seq, but give rise to a more complex data structure. There is a need for new tools that can handle the various barcoding strategies used by different protocols and exploit this information for quality assessment at the sample-level and provide effective visualization of these results in preparation for higher-level analyses. To this end, we developed scPipe, an R/Bioconductor package that integrates barcode demultiplexing, read alignment, UMI-aware gene-level quantification and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple protocols that include CEL-seq, MARS-seq, Chromium 10X, Drop-seq and Smart-seq. scPipe produces a count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with an HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing. scPipe performs this processing in a few simple R commands, promoting reproducible analysis of single-cell data that is compatible with the emerging suite of open-source scRNA-seq analysis tools available in R/Bioconductor and beyond.

N2  - Breast cancer (BC) is increasing in incidence and resistance to treatment worldwide. The challenges in limited therapeutic options and poor survival outcomes in BC subtypes persist because of its molecular heterogeneity and resistance to standard endocrine therapy. Recently, high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been used to identify biomarkers of disease progression and signaling pathways that could be amenable to specific therapies according to the BC subtype. However, there is no single generally accepted pipeline for the analysis of RNA-seq data in biomarker discovery due, in part, to the needs of simultaneously satisfying constraints of sensitivity and specificity. We proposed a combined approach using gene-wise normalization, UQ-pgQ2, followed by a Wald test from DESeq2. Our approach improved the analysis based on within-group comparisons in terms of the specificity when applied to publicly available RNA-seq BC datasets. In terms of identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we combined an optimized log 2 fold change cutoff with a nominal false discovery rate of 0.05 to further minimize false positives. Using this method in the analysis of two GEO BC datasets, we identified 797 DEGs uniquely expressed in triple negative BC (TNBC) and significantly associated with T cell and immune-related signaling, contributing to the immunotherapeutic efficacy in TNBC patients. In contrast, we identified 1403 DEGs uniquely expressed in estrogen positive and HER2 negative BC (ER + HER2 - BC) and significantly associated with eicosanoid, notching and FAK signaling while a common set of genes was associated with cellular growth and proliferation. Thus, our approach to control for false positives identified two distinct gene expression profiles associated with these two subtypes of BC which are distinguishable by their molecular and functional attributes. © 2018 Li et al.

N2  - Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon of differential allelic expression based on parental origin. To date, 263 imprinted genes have been identified among all investigated mammalian species. However, only 21 have been described in sheep, of which 11 are annotated in the current ovine genome. Here, we aim to i) use DNA/RNA high throughput sequencing to identify new monoallelically expressed and imprinted genes in day 135 ovine fetuses and ii) determine whether maternal diet (100%, 60%, or 140% of National Research Council Total Digestible Nutrients) influences expression of imprinted genes. We also reported strategies to solve technical challenges in the data analysis pipeline. We identified 80 monoallelically expressed, 13 new putative imprinted genes, and five known imprinted genes in sheep using the 263 genes stated above as a guide. Sanger sequencing confirmed allelic expression of seven genes, CASD1, COPG2, DIRAS3, INPP5F, PLAGL1, PPP1R9A, and SLC22A18. Among the 13 putative imprinted genes, five were localized in the known sheep imprinting domains of MEST on chromosome 4, DLK1/GTL2 on chromosome 18 and KCNQ1 on chromosome 21, and three were in a novel sheep imprinted cluster on chromosome 4, known in other species as PEG10/SGCE. The expression of DIRAS3, IGF2, PHLDA2, and SLC22A18 was altered by maternal diet, albeit without allelic expression reversal. Together, our results expanded the list of sheep imprinted genes to 34 and demonstrated that while the expression levels of four imprinted genes were changed by maternal diet, the allelic expression patterns were un-changed for all imprinted genes studied. © 2018, © 2018 The Author (s).

N2  - Whole transcriptome studies typically yield large amounts of data, with expression values for all genes or transcripts of the genome. The search for genes of interest in a particular study setting can thus be a daunting task, usually relying on automated computational methods. Moreover, most biological questions imply that such a search should be performed in a multivariate setting, to take into account the inter-genes relationships. Differential expression analysis commonly yields large lists of genes deemed significant, even after adjustment for multiple testing, making the subsequent study possibilities extensive. Here, we explore the use of supervised learning methods to rank large ensembles of genes defined by their expression values measured with RNA-Seq in a typical 2 classes sample set. First, we use one of the variable importance measures generated by the random forests classification algorithm as a metric to rank genes. Second, we define the EPS (extreme pseudo-samples) pipeline, making use of VAEs (Variational Autoencoders) and regressors to extract a ranking of genes while leveraging the feature space of both virtual and comparable samples. We show that, on 12 cancer RNA-Seq data sets ranging from 323 to 1,210 samples, using either a random forests-based gene selection method or the EPS pipeline outperforms differential expression analysis for 9 and 8 out of the 12 datasets respectively, in terms of identifying subsets of genes associated with survival. These results demonstrate the potential of supervised learning-based gene selection methods in RNA-Seq studies and highlight the need to use such multivariate gene selection methods alongside the widely used differential expression analysis. © 2018 Wenric and Shemirani.

N2  - Background: The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is essential for the proper development of the mammalian embryo. A maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals during preimplantation bears the potential for transgenerational inheritance of disease through the epigenetic perturbation of the developing embryo. A comprehensive assembly of embryo-specific miRNAs and respective isoforms (isomiR) is lacking to date. We aimed at revealing the sex-specific miRNA expression profile of single porcine blastocysts developing in gilts orally exposed to exogenous estradiol-17[InlineMediaObject not available: see fulltext.] (E2). Therefore we analyzed the miRNA profile specifically focusing on isomiRs and potentially embryo-specific miRNAs. Results: Deep sequencing of small RNA (small RNA-seq) result in the detection of miRNA sequences mapping to known and predicted porcine miRNAs as well as novel miRNAs highly conserved in human and cattle. A set of highly abundant miRNAs and a large number of rarely expressed miRNAs were identified by using a small RNA analysis pipeline, which was integrated into a novel Galaxy workflow specifically benefits incompletely annotated species. In particular, orthologue species information increased the total number of annotated miRNAs, while mapping to other non-coding RNAs avoided falsely annotated miRNAs. Neither the low nor the high dose of E2 treatment (10 and 1000 μ E2/kg body weight daily, respectively) affected the miRNA profile in blastocysts despite the distinct differential mRNA expression and DNA methylation found in previous studies. The high number of generated sequence reads enabled a comprehensive analysis of the isomiR repertoire showing various templated and non-templated modifications. Furthermore, potentially blastocyst-specific miRNAs were identified. Conclusions: In pre-implantation embryos, numerous distinct isomiRs were discovered indicating a high complexity of miRNA expression. Neither the sex of the embryo nor a maternal E2 exposure affected the miRNA expression profile of developing porcine blastocysts. The adaptation to the continuous duration of the E2 treatment might explain the lack of an effect. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: The next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has greatly facilitated genomic and transcriptomic studies, contributing significantly in expanding the current knowledge on genome and transcriptome. However, the continually evolving variety of sequencing platforms, protocols and analytical pipelines has led the research community to focus on cross-platform evaluation and standardization. As a NGS pioneer in China, the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) has announced its own NGS platform designated as BGISEQ-500, since 2016. The capability of this platform in large-scale DNA sequencing and small RNA analysis has been already evaluated. However, the comparative performance of BGISEQ-500 platform in transcriptome analysis remains yet to be elucidated. The Illumina series, a leading sequencing platform in China's sequencing market, would be a preferable reference to evaluate new platforms. Methods: To this end, we describe a cross-platform comparative study between BGISEQ-500 and Illumina HiSeq4000 for analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana WT (Col 0) transcriptome. The key parameters in RNA sequencing and transcriptomic data processing were assessed in biological replicate experiments, using aforesaid platforms. Results: The results from the two platforms BGISEQ-500 and Illumina HiSeq4000 shared high concordance in both inter- (correlation, 0.88-0.93) and intra-platform (correlation, 0.95-0.98) comparison for gene quantification, identification of differentially expressed genes and alternative splicing events. However, the two platforms yielded highly variable interpretation results for single nucleotide polymorphism and insertion-deletion analysis. Conclusion: The present case study provides a comprehensive reference dataset to validate the capability of BGISEQ-500 enabling it to be established as a competitive and reliable platform in plant transcriptome analysis. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) related applications allow for rapid explorations due to their high-throughput and relatively fast experimental capabilities, providing unprecedented progress in gene functional annotation, gene regulation analysis, and environmental factor verification. However, with increasing amounts of sequenced reads and reference model species, the selection of appropriate reference species for gene annotation has become a new challenge. Methods: We proposed a novel approach for finding the most effective reference model species through taxonomic associations and ultra-conserved orthologous (UCO) gene comparisons among species. An online system for multiple species selection (MSS) for RNA-seq differential expression analysis was developed, and comprehensive genomic annotations from 291 reference model eukaryotic species were retrieved from the RefSeq, KEGG, and UniProt databases. Results: Using the proposed MSS pipeline, gene ontology and biological pathway enrichment analysis can be efficiently achieved, especially in the case of transcriptomic analysis of non-model organisms. The results showed that the proposed method solved problems related to limitations in annotation information and provided a roughly twenty-fold reduction in computational time, resulting in more accurate results than those of traditional approaches of using a single model reference species or the large non-redundant reference database. Conclusions: Selection of appropriate reference model species helps to reduce missing annotation information, allowing for more comprehensive results than those obtained with a single model reference species. In addition, adequate model species selection reduces the computational time significantly while retaining the same order of accuracy. The proposed system indeed provides superior performance by selecting appropriate multiple species for transcriptomic analysis compared to traditional approaches. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Alternative splicing is a ubiquitous post-transcriptional regulation mechanism in most eukaryotic genes. Aberrant splicing isoforms and abnormal isoform ratios can contribute to cancer development. Kinase genes are key regulators of multiple cellular processes. Many kinases are found to be oncogenic and have been intensively investigated in the study of cancer and drugs. RNA-Seq provides a powerful technology for genome-wide study of alternative splicing in cancer besides the conventional gene expression profiling. But this potential has not been fully demonstrated yet. Methods: We characterized the transcriptome profile of prostate cancer using RNA-Seq data from viewpoints of both differential expression and differential splicing, with an emphasis on kinase genes and their splicing variations. We built a pipeline to conduct differential expression and differential splicing analysis, followed by functional enrichment analysis. We performed kinase domain analysis to identify the functionally important candidate kinase gene in prostate cancer, and calculated the expression levels of isoforms to explore the function of isoform switching of kinase genes in prostate cancer. Results: We identified distinct gene groups from differential expression and splicing analyses, which suggested that alternative splicing adds another level to gene expression regulation. Enriched GO terms of differentially expressed and spliced kinase genes were found to play different roles in regulation of cellular metabolism. Function analysis on differentially spliced kinase genes showed that differentially spliced exons of these genes are significantly enriched in protein kinase domains. Among them, we found that gene CDK5 has isoform switching between prostate cancer and benign tissues, which may affect cancer development by changing androgen receptor (AR) phosphorylation. The observation was validated in another RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines. Conclusions: Our work characterized the expression and splicing profiles of kinase genes in prostate cancer and proposed a hypothetical model on isoform switching of CDK5 and AR phosphorylation in prostate cancer. These findings bring new understanding to the role of alternatively spliced kinases in prostate cancer and also demonstrate the use of RNA-Seq data in studying alternative splicing in cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - One of the main benefits of using modern RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology is the more accurate gene expression estimations compared with previous generations of expression data, such as the microarray. However, numerous issues can result in the possibility that an RNA-Seq read can be mapped to multiple locations on the reference genome with the same alignment scores, which occurs in plant, animal, and metagenome samples. Such a read is so-called a multiple-mapping read (MMR). The impact of these MMRs is reflected in gene expression estimation and all downstream analyses, including differential gene expression, functional enrichment, etc. Current analysis pipelines lack the tools to effectively test the reliability of gene expression estimations, thus are incapable of ensuring the validity of all downstream analyses. Our investigation into 95 RNA-Seq datasets from seven plant and animal species (totaling 1,951 GB) indicates an average of roughly 22% of all reads are MMRs. Here we present a machine learning-based tool called GeneQC (Gene expression Quality Control), which can accurately estimate the reliability of each gene's expression level derived from an RNA-Seq dataset. The underlying algorithm is designed based on extracted genomic and transcriptomic features, which are then combined using elastic-net regularization and mixture model fitting to provide a clearer picture of mapping uncertainty for each gene. GeneQC allows researchers to determine reliable expression estimations and conduct further analysis on the gene expression that is of sufficient quality. This tool also enables researchers to investigate continued re-alignment methods to determine more accurate gene expression estimates for those with low reliability. Application of GeneQC reveals high level of mapping uncertainty in plant samples and limited, severe mapping uncertainty in animal samples.

N2  - Knowledge of immune cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment is essential for understanding mechanisms of cancer progression and immunotherapy response. We profiled 45,000 immune cells from eight breast carcinomas, as well as matched normal breast tissue, blood, and lymph nodes, using single-cell RNA-seq. We developed a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-cell data. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumor tissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypic expansions specific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000 additional T cells revealed the combinatorial impact of TCR utilization on phenotypic diversity. Our results support a model of continuous activation in T cells and do not comport with the macrophage polarization model in cancer. Our results have important implications for characterizing tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Single-cell analysis of the breast tumor immune microenvironment, coupled with computational analysis, yields an immune map of breast cancer that points to continuous T cell activation and differentiation states. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - SF-1/NR5A1 is a transcriptional regulator of adrenal and gonadal development. NR5A1 disease-causing variants cause disorders of sex development (DSD) and adrenal failure, but most affected individuals show a broad DSD/reproductive phenotype only. Most NR5A1 variants show in vitro pathogenic effects, but not when tested in heterozygote state together with wild-type NR5A1 as usually seen in patients. Thus, the genotype−phenotype correlation for NR5A1 variants remains an unsolved question. We analyzed heterozygous 46,XY SF-1/NR5A1 patients by whole exome sequencing and used an algorithm for data analysis based on selected project-specific DSD- and SF-1-related genes. The variants detected were evaluated for their significance in literature, databases and checked in silico using webtools. We identified 19 potentially deleterious variants (one to seven per patient) in 18 genes in four 46,XY DSD subjects carrying heterozygous NR5A1 disease-causing variants. We constructed a scheme of all these hits within the landscape of currently known genes involved in male sex determination and differentiation. Our results suggest that the broad phenotype in these heterozygous NR5A1 46,XY DSD subjects may well be explained by an oligogenic mode of inheritance, in which multiple hits, individually non-deleterious, may contribute to a DSD phenotype unique to each heterozygous SF-1/NR5A1 individual. © 2018, European Society of Human Genetics.

N2  - Background: Previous studies demonstrated that prognosis of germline deficiency in mismatch repair protein (dMMR) was different from that of sporadic dMMR. The underlying mechanism has not been studied. Methods: From a prospectively maintained database, we collected dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) patients identified by postoperative immunohistochemistry screening. According to genetic test, patients were grouped as Lynch-associated or sporadic dMMR.We compared the clinical-pathological features, prognosis, and immunoreactive differences between the two groups. By whole-exome sequencing and neoantigen detection pipeline, mutational frequencies and neoantigen burdens were also compared. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Sixty-seven sporadic dMMR and 85 Lynch-associated CRC patients were included in the study. Sporadic dMMR patients were older (P < .001) and their tumors were poorly differentiated (P .03). The survival was better in the Lynch-associated group (P .001). After adjustment, the difference still remained statistically significant (hazard ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.95, P .04). The scores of Crohn's-like reaction (CRO; P < .001), immunoreactions in the invasivemargin (IM; P .01), tumor stroma (TS; P .009), and cancer nest (CN; P .02) of the Lynch-associated group were statistically significantly higher. The numbers of CD3 , CD8 , Foxp3 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in IM; CD3 , CD4 TILs in TS; and CD3 , CD4 , CD8 TILs in CN were statistically significantly higher in Lynch-associated dMMR patients. Based on the 16 patients who under went whole-exome sequencing, there were alsomore somaticmutations and neoantigen burdens in the Lynch-associated group compared with the sporadic dMMR group (439/pt vs 68/pt, P .006; 628/pt vs 97/pt, P .009). Conclusions: There are heterogeneities in dMMR CRCs. Lynch-associated dMMR patients present with more somatic mutations and neoantigens compared with sporadic dMMR, which probably results in stronger immunoreactions and survival improvement. © 2018 Oxford University Press.

N2  - Illumina Hiseq 2500 deep sequencing was used to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in matched pairs of isograft corneas and normal corneas, allograft corneas and isograft corneas. Our results showed that 22 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 4 were significantly downregulated in the isograft group when compared with the control group (P < 0.01), while 17 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 3 were significantly downregulated in the allograft group when compared with the isograft group (P < 0.01). Among the miRNAs with altered expression levels, miR-155-5p, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, and miR-223-3p displayed simultaneous changes in the above two comparisons. Potential target genes among the DEGs were predicted using target prediction software (TargetScan, Miranda, miRDB, and CLIP), and the overlay portion was analyzed using the Gene Ontology (GO) database and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). GO and KEGG analyses showed that the DEGs were mainly involved in metabolic pathways, cytokine secretion, and tumor immunity functions. An analysis of the interactions between DEG proteins (PPI analysis) and a MetaCore software analysis of 4 key DEGs revealed that the genes regulated by miR-155-5p played important roles in the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. Furthermore, the MetaCore analysis identified C/EBP beta, p53, and sp1 as key transcription factors in that network. Our study identified transplanted corneas-specific miRNA in matched pairs of isograft corneas and normal corneas, allograft corneas and isograft corneas. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis of the key miRNA regulatory network revealed the molecular mechanisms, which suggests miRNAs may as new molecular targets for treating corneal injuries and corneal transplant rejection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Environmental sequencing has greatly expanded our knowledge of micro-eukaryotic diversity and ecology by revealing previously unknown lineages and their distribution. However, the value of these data is critically dependent on the quality of the reference databases used to assign an identity to environmental sequences. Existing databases contain errors and struggle to keep pace with rapidly changing eukaryotic taxonomy, the influx of novel diversity, and computational challenges related to assembling the high-quality alignments and trees needed for accurate characterization of lineage diversity. EukRef (eukref.org) is an ongoing community-driven initiative that addresses these challenges by bringing together taxonomists with expertise spanning the eukaryotic tree of life and microbial ecologists, who use environmental sequence data to develop reliable reference databases across the diversity of microbial eukaryotes. EukRef organizes and facilitates rigorous mining and annotation of sequence data by providing protocols, guidelines, and tools. The EukRef pipeline and tools allow users interested in a particular group of microbial eukaryotes to retrieve all sequences belonging to that group from International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) (GenBank, the European Nucleotide Archive [ENA], or the DNA DataBank of Japan [DDBJ]), to place those sequences in a phylogenetic tree, and to curate taxonomic and environmental information for the group. We provide guidelines to facilitate the process and to standardize taxonomic annotations. The final outputs of this process are (1) a reference tree and alignment, (2) a reference sequence database, including taxonomic and environmental information, and (3) a list of putative chimeras and other artifactual sequences. These products will be useful for the broad community as they become publicly available (at eukref.org) and are shared with existing reference databases. © 2018 del Campo et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

N2  - Thus far, no systematic studies have examined circRNA expression profiles in the silkworm following B.mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection. To explore the expression patterns of circRNAs in the silkworm midgut following BmNPV infection, circRNAs in normal midguts and BmNPV-infected midguts were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. A total of 353 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed, of which 241 were upregulated and 112 were downregulated following infection. GO annotation and KEGG pathways analyses of these circRNAs showed that many key immunity pathways and metabolism pathways were enriched in the BmNPV-infected midguts. The potential roles of the predicted targets of the miRNAs that interacted with the circRNAs showed that ubiquitin, apoptosis, and endocytosis signaling pathways were enriched significantly by BmNPV infection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (PRCC) is a heterogeneous disease with variations in disease progression and clinical outcomes. The advent of next generation sequencing techniques (NGS) has generated data from patients that can be analysed to develop a predictive model. In this study, we have adopted a machine learning approach to identify biomarkers and build classifiers to discriminate between early and late stages of PRCC from gene expression profiles. A machine learning pipeline incorporating different feature selection algorithms and classification models is developed to analyse RNA sequencing dataset (RNASeq). Further, to get a reliable feature set, we extracted features from different partitions of the training dataset and aggregated them into feature sets for classification. We evaluated the performance of different algorithms on the basis of 10-fold cross validation and independent test dataset. 10-fold cross validation was also performed on a microarray dataset of PRCC. A random forest based feature selection (varSelRF) yielded minimum number of features (104) and a best performance with area under Precision Recall curve (PR-AUC) of 0.804, MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) of 0.711 and accuracy of 88% with Shrunken Centroid classifier on a test dataset. We identified 80 genes that are consistently altered between stages by different feature selection algorithms. The extracted features are related to cellular components - centromere, kinetochore and spindle, and biological process mitotic cell cycle. These observations reveal potential mechanisms for an increase in chromosome instability in the late stage of PRCC. Our study demonstrates that the gene expression profiles can be used to classify stages of PRCC. © 2018

N2  - Clustering of genes and/or samples is a common task in gene expression analysis. The goals in clustering can vary, but an important scenario is that of finding biologically meaningful subtypes within the samples. This is an application that is particularly appropriate when there are large numbers of samples, as in many human disease studies. With the increasing popularity of single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), many more controlled experiments on model organisms are similarly creating large gene expression datasets with the goal of detecting previously unknown heterogeneity within cells. It is common in the detection of novel subtypes to run many clustering algorithms, as well as rely on subsampling and ensemble methods to improve robustness. We introduce a Bioconductor R package, clusterExperiment, that implements a general and flexible strategy we entitle Resampling-based Sequential Ensemble Clustering (RSEC). RSEC enables the user to easily create multiple, competing clusterings of the data based on different techniques and associated tuning parameters, including easy integration of resampling and sequential clustering, and then provides methods for consolidating the multiple clusterings into a final consensus clustering. The package is modular and allows the user to separately apply the individual components of the RSEC procedure, i.e., apply multiple clustering algorithms, create a consensus clustering or choose tuning parameters, and merge clusters. Additionally, clusterExperiment provides a variety of visualization tools for the clustering process, as well as methods for the identification of possible cluster signatures or biomarkers. The R package clusterExperiment is publicly available through the Bioconductor Project, with a detailed manual (vignette) as well as well documented help pages for each function. © 2018 Risso et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

N2  - MiRNAs regulate the expression of target genes in diverse cellular processes and hence play important roles in different physiological processes, yet little is known about the stomach microRNAome (miRNAome) of the Tibetan pig. The objective of this experiment was to investigate differentially expressed stomach miRNAs participating in digestion. Firstly, we isolated total RNA by Trizol reagent from three Tibetan and three Yorkshire purebred pigs stomach samples at 90-day-old. Secondly, a comprehensive analysis of Tibetan and Yorkshire pig stomach miRNAomes was performed by small RNA sequencing in the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Finally, SYBR Green Real-time RT-PCR was performed to validate the differentially expressed miRNAs. We identified 318 unique miRNAs, 260 were co-expressed in both libraries, 17 and 31 miRNAs were specifically expressed in Tibetan and Yorkshire pigs respectively. Fifty six differentially expressed miRNAs were identified by the identifying differentially expressed genes 6 (IDEG6). Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis revealed that some of the differentially expressed miRNAs were associated with protein and fat digestion. Two differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-214-3p and ssc-un39) participating in the digestion of lipid were identified. Additionally, qRT-PCR results suggested that a higher expression of miR-214-3p in the Tibetan pig stomach could lead to relatively lower expression of calcium-dependent phospholipase A2, which is an enzyme important for the digestion of glycerol phospholipid. This study has delineated the different stomach miRNAs expression patterns of Tibetan and Yorkshire pigs, which would help explain the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in digestion of Tibetan pigs, and contribute to utilize a the unique digestion merits of Tibetan pig in future porcine hybridization breeding. © 2018, The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) transcription is controlled by several promoters, which drive expression of multiple transcripts encoding an identical protein. We previously reported that BDNF derived from promoters I and II is highly expressed in hypothalamus and is critical for regulating aggression in male mice. Here we report that BDNF loss from these promoters causes reduced sexual receptivity and impaired maternal care in female mice, which is concomitant with decreased oxytocin (Oxt) expression during development. We identify a novel link between BDNF signaling, oxytocin, and maternal behavior by demonstrating that ablation of TrkB selectively in OXT neurons partially recapitulates maternal care impairments observed in BDNF-deficient females. Using translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA-sequencing we define a molecular profile for OXT neurons and delineate how BDNF signaling impacts gene pathways critical for structural and functional plasticity. Our findings highlight BDNF as a modulator of sexually-dimorphic hypothalamic circuits that govern female-typical behaviors. © Maynard et al.

N2  - Gene post-transcription regulation involves several critical regulators such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Accumulated experimental evidences have shown that miRNAs and RBPs can competitively regulate the shared targeting transcripts. Although this establishes a novel post-transcription regulation mechanism, there are currently no computational tools to scan for the possible competing miRNA and RBP pairs. Here, we developed a novel computational pipeline—RBPvsMIR—that enables us to statistically evaluate the competing relationship between miRNAs and RBPs. RBPvsMIR first combines with previously successful miRNAs and RBP motifs discovery applications to search for overlapping or adjacent binding sites along a given RNA sequence. Then a permutation test is performed to select the miRNA and RBP pairs with the significantly enriched binding sites. As an example, we used RBPvsMIR to identify 235 competing RBP-miRNA pairs for long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MALAT1. Wet lab experiments verified that splicing factor SRSF2 competes with miR-383, miR-502 and miR-101 to regulate MALAT1 in esophageal squamous carcinoma cells. Our study also revealed the global mutual exclusive pattern for miRNAs and RBP to regulate human lncRNAs. In addition, we provided a convenient web server (http://bmc.med.stu.edu.cn/RBPvsMIR), which should accelerate the exploration of competing miRNAs and RBP pairs regulating the shared targeting transcripts. © 2018 by the authors.

N2  - Single-cell RNA-seq’s (scRNA-seq) unprecedented cellular resolution at a genome-wide scale enables us to address questions about cellular heterogeneity that are inaccessible using methods that average over bulk tissue extracts. However, scRNA-seq data sets also present additional challenges such as high transcript dropout rates, stochastic transcription events, and complex population substructures. Here, we present a single-cell RNA-seq analysis and klustering evaluation (SAKE), a robust method for scRNA-seq analysis that provides quantitative statistical metrics at each step of the analysis pipeline. Comparing SAKE to multiple single-cell analysis methods shows that most methods perform similarly across a wide range of cellular contexts, with SAKE outperforming these methods in the case of large complex populations. We next applied the SAKE algorithms to identify drug-resistant cellular populations as human melanoma cells respond to targeted BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). Single-cell RNA-seq data from both the Fluidigm C1 and 10x Genomics platforms were analyzed with SAKE to dissect this problem at multiple scales. Data from both platforms indicate that BRAF inhibitor-resistant cells can emerge from rare populations already present before drug application, with SAKE identifying both novel and known markers of resistance. These experimentally validated markers of BRAFi resistance share overlap with previous analyses in different melanoma cell lines, demonstrating the generality of these findings and highlighting the utility of single-cell analysis to elucidate mechanisms of BRAFi resistance. © 2018 Ho et al.

N2  - Numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) identified and characterized in mammals, plants and fungi have been found to play critical regulatory roles in biological processes. However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in oomycete plant pathogens, which cause devastating damage to the economy and ecosystems. We used strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to generate a computational pipeline to identify lncRNAs in Phytophthora sojae, a model oomycete plant pathogen. In total, 940 lncRNAs with 1010 isoforms were identified from RNA-seq data obtained from four representative stages of P. sojae. The lncRNAs had shorter transcript lengths, longer exon lengths, fewer numbers of exons, lower GC content and higher minimum free energy values compared with protein-coding genes. lncRNAs in P. sojae exhibited low sequence conservation amongst oomycetes and P. sojae isolates. Transcriptional data indicated that P. sojae lncRNAs tended to be transcribed in a stage-specific manner; representative lncRNAs were validated by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Phytophthora sojae lncRNAs were concentrated in gene-sparse regions, and lncRNAs were associated with secreted protein and effector coding genes. The neighbouring genes of lncRNAs encoded various effector family members, and RNA-seq data revealed a correlation between the transcription level of lncRNAs and their neighbouring genes. Our results provide the first comprehensive identification of lncRNAs in oomycetes and suggest a potential association between lncRNAs and effector genes. © 2018 BSPP and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - The quality of RNA sequencing data relies on specific priming by the primer used for reverse transcription (RT-primer). Nonspecific annealing of the RT-primer to the RNA template can generate reads with incorrect cDNA ends and can cause misinterpretation of data (RT mispriming). This kind of artifact in RNA-seq based technologies is underappreciated and currently no adequate tools exist to computationally remove them from published data sets. We show that mispriming can occur with as little as two bases of complementarity at the 3′′ end of the primer followed by intermittent regions of complementarity. We also provide a computational pipeline that identifies cDNA reads produced from RT mispriming, allowing users to filter them out from any aligned data set. Using this analysis pipeline, we identify thousands of mispriming events in a dozen published data sets from diverse technologies including short RNA-seq, total/mRNA-seq, HITS-CLIP, and GRO-seq. We further show how RT mispriming can lead to misinterpretation of data. In addition to providing a solution to computationally remove RT-misprimed reads, we also propose an experimental solution to completely avoid RT-mispriming by performing RNA-seq using thermostable group II intron derived reverse transcriptase (TGIRT-seq). © 2018 Shivram and Iyer

N2  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming a prevalent approach to quantify gene expression and is expected to gain better insights into a number of biological and biomedical questions compared to DNA microarrays. Most importantly, RNA-seq allows us to quantify expression at the gene or transcript levels. However, leveraging the RNA-seq data requires development of new data mining and analytics methods. Supervised learning methods are commonly used approaches for biological data analysis that have recently gained attention for their applications to RNA-seq data. Here, we assess the utility of supervised learning methods trained on RNA-seq data for a diverse range of biological classification tasks. We hypothesize that the transcript-level expression data are more informative for biological classification tasks than the gene-level expression data. Our large-scale assessment utilizes multiple data sets, organisms, lab groups, and RNA-seq analysis pipelines. Overall, we performed and assessed 61 biological classification problems that leverage three independent RNA-seq data sets and include over 2000 samples that come from multiple organisms, lab groups, and RNA-seq analyses. These 61 problems include predictions of the tissue type, sex, or age of the sample, healthy or cancerous phenotypes, and pathological tumor stages for the samples from the cancerous tissue. For each problem, the performance of three normalization techniques and six machine learning classifiers was explored. We find that for every single classification problem, the transcript-based classifiers outperform or are comparable with gene expression-based methods. The top-performing techniques reached a near perfect classification accuracy, demonstrating the utility of supervised learning for RNA-seq based data analysis. © 2018 Babina et al.

N2  - Detection of coding/functional SNPs that change the biological function of a gene may lead to identification of putative causative alleles within QTL regions and discovery of genetic markers with large effects on phenotypes. This study has two-fold objectives, first to develop, and validate a 50K transcribed gene SNP-chip using RNA-Seq data. To achieve this objective, two bioinformatics pipelines, GATK and SAMtools, were used to identify ~21K transcribed SNPs with allelic imbalances associated with important aquaculture production traits including body weight, muscle yield, muscle fat content, shear force, and whiteness in addition to resistance/susceptibility to bacterial cold-water disease (BCWD). SNPs ere identified from pooled RNA-Seq data collected from ~620 fish, representing 98 families from growth- And 54 families from BCWD-selected lines with divergent phenotypes. In addition, ~29K transcribed SNPs without allelic-imbalances were strategically added to build a 50K Affymetrix SNP-chip. SNPs selected included two SNPs per gene from 14K genes and ~5K non-synonymous SNPs. The SNP-chip was used to genotype 1728 fish. The average SNP calling-rate for samples passing quality control (QC; 1,641 fish) was ≥ 98.5%. The second objective of this study was to test the feasibility of using the new SNP-chip in GWA (Genome-wide association) analysis to identify QTL explaining muscle yield variance. GWA study on 878 fish (representing 197 families from 2 consecutive generations) with muscle yield phenotypes and genotyped for 35K polymorphic markers (passing QC) identified several QTL regions explaining together up to 28.40% of the additive genetic variance for muscle yield in this rainbow trout population. The most significant QTLs were on chromosomes 14 and 16 with 12.71 and 10.49% of the genetic variance, respectively. Many of the annotated genes in the QTL regions were previously reported as important regulators of muscle development and cell signaling. No major QTLs were identified in a previous GWA study using a 57K genomic SNP chip on the same fish population. These results indicate improved detection power of the transcribed gene SNP-chip in the target trait and population, allowing identification of large-effect QTLs for important traits in rainbow trout. © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

N2  - Musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries are complex phenotypes with genetics being one of many proposed risk factors. Case-control association studies using the candidate gene approach have predominately been used to identify risk loci for these injuries. However, the ability to identify all risk conferring variants using this approach alone is unlikely. Therefore, this study aimed to further define the genetic profile of these injuries using an integrated omics approach involving whole exome sequencing and a customised analyses pipeline. The exomes of ten exemplar asymptomatic controls and ten exemplar cases with Achilles tendinopathy were individually sequenced using a platform that included the coverage of the untranslated regions and miRBase miRNA genes. Approximately 200 000 variants were identified in the sequenced samples. Previous research was used to guide a targeted analysis of the genes encoding the tenascin-C (TNC) glycoprotein and the α1 chain of type XXVII collagen (COL27A1) located on chromosome 9. Selection of variants within these genes were; however, not predetermined but based on a tiered filtering strategy. Four variants in TNC (rs1061494, rs1138545, rs2104772 and rs1061495) and three variants in the upstream COL27A1 gene (rs2567706, rs2241671 and rs2567705) were genotyped in larger Achilles tendinopathy and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture sample groups. The CC genotype of TNC rs1061494 (C/T) was associated with the risk of Achilles tendinopathy (p = 0.018, OR: 2.5 95% CI: 1.2–5.1). Furthermore, the AA genotype of the TNC rs2104772 (A/T) variant was significantly associated with ACL ruptures in the female subgroup (p = 0.035, OR: 2.3 95% CI: 1.1–5.5). An inferred haplotype in the TNC gene was also associated with the risk of Achilles tendinopathy. These results provide a proof of concept for the use of a customised pipeline for the exploration of a larger genomic dataset. This approach, using previous research to guide a targeted analysis of the data has generated new genetic signatures in the biology of musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. © 2018 Gibbon et al.

N2  - Hylobius abietis (Linnaeus), or large pine weevil (Coleoptera, Curculionidae), is a pest of European coniferous forests. In order to gain understanding of the functional physiology of this species, we have assembled a de novo transcriptome of H. abietis, from sequence data obtained by Next Generation Sequencing. In particular, we have identified genes encoding neuropeptides, peptide hormones and their putative G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to gain insights into neuropeptide-modulated processes. The transcriptome was assembled de novo from pooled paired-end, sequence reads obtained from RNA from whole adults, gut and central nervous system tissue samples. Data analysis was performed on the transcripts obtained from the assembly including, annotation, gene ontology and functional assignment as well as transcriptome completeness assessment and KEGG pathway analysis. Pipelines were created using Bioinformatics tools and techniques for prediction and identification of neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors. Peptidomic analysis was also carried out using a combination of MALDI-TOF as well as Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry to confirm the identified neuropeptide. 41 putative neuropeptide families were identified in H. abietis, including Adipokinetic hormone (AKH), CAPA and DH31. Neuropeptide F, which has not been yet identified in the model beetle T. castaneum, was identified. Additionally, 24 putative neuropeptide and 9 leucine-rich repeat containing G protein coupled receptor-encoding transcripts were determined using both alignment as well as non-alignment methods. This information, submitted to the NCBI sequence read archive repository (SRA accession: SRP133355), can now be used to inform understanding of neuropeptide-modulated physiology and behaviour in H. abietis; and to develop specific neuropeptide-based tools for H. abietis control. © 2018

N2  - In the hippocampus, the classical pyramidal cell type of the subiculum acts as a primary output, conveying hippocampal signals to a diverse suite of downstream regions. Accumulating evidence suggests that the subiculum pyramidal cell population may actually be comprised of discrete subclasses. Here, we investigated the extent and organizational principles governing pyramidal cell heterogeneity throughout the mouse subiculum. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we find that the subiculum pyramidal cell population can be deconstructed into eight separable subclasses. These subclasses were mapped onto abutting spatial domains, ultimately producing a complex laminar and columnar organization with heterogeneity across classical dorsal-ventral, proximal-distal, and superficial-deep axes. We further show that these transcriptomically defined subclasses correspond to differential protein products and can be associated with specific projection targets. This work deconstructs the complex landscape of subiculum pyramidal cells into spatially segregated subclasses that may be observed, controlled, and interpreted in future experiments. © Cembrowski et al.

N2  - The plating coral, Agaricia lamarcki is a widely distributed species inhabiting reefs across the Caribbean basin and Florida. This species is of interest since it is considered a depth-generalist, found from 10 to 70 m. Given the scope of contemporary studies on this coral's population dynamics and physiology, as well as, the potential of mesophotic reefs to be refuge habitats for deteriorated shallow water reefs, we present the first de novo transcriptome assembly of an important mesophotic coral. Using next-generation paired-end sequencing (Illumina Hiseq4000; 2 × 150 bp), we obtained a total of 82,506,058 raw reads. The novel transcriptome assembly strategy included the recently developed National Center for Genome Analysis Support de novo transcriptome assembly pipeline. Assembly produced a total of 101,322 biologically true, non-redundant transcripts with an average contig length of 959 and N50 of 1830. EvidentialGene and TransDecoder were used to identify open reading frames (ORFs) with homology insight provided by the UniProtKb and PFAM databases.

N2  - Motivation: De novo transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq offers a promising means to study gene expression in non-model organisms. Yet, the difficulty of transcriptome assembly means that the contigs provided by the assembler often represent a fractured and incomplete view of the transcriptome, complicating downstream analysis. We introduce Grouper, a new method for clustering contigs from de novo assemblies that are likely to belong to the same transcripts and genes; these groups can subsequently be analyzed more robustly. When provided with access to the genome of a related organism, Grouper can transfer annotations to the de novo assembly, further improving the clustering. Results: On de novo assemblies from four different species, we show that Grouper is able to accurately cluster a larger number of contigs than the existing state-of-the-art method. TheGrouper pipeline is able to map greater than 10% more reads against the contigs, leading to accurate downstreamdifferential expression analyses. The labeling module, in the presence of a closely related annotated genome, can efficiently transfer annotations to the contigs and use this information to further improve clustering. Overall, Grouper provides a complete and efficient pipeline for processing de novo transcriptomic assemblies. © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Circular RNA (circRNA) is an important member of non-coding RNA family. Numerous computational methods for detecting circRNAs from RNA-seq data have been developed in the past few years, but there are dramatic differences among the algorithms regarding the balancing of the sensitivity and precision of the detection and filtering strategies. To further improve the sensitivity, while maintaining an acceptable precision of circRNA detection, a novel and efficient de novo detection algorithm, CIRCPlus, is proposed in this paper. CIRCPlus accurately locates circRNA candidates by identifying a set of back-spliced junction reads by comparing the local similar sequence of each pair of spanning junction reads. This strategy, thus, utilizes the important information provided by unbalanced spanning reads, which facilitates the detection especially when the expression levels of circRNA are unapparent. The performance of CIRCPlus was tested and compared to the existing de novo methods on the real datasets as well as a series of simulation datasets with different configurations. The experiment results demonstrated that the sensitivities of CIRCPlus were able to reach 90% in common simulation settings, while CIRCPlus held balanced sensitivity and reliability on the real datasets according to an objective assessment criteria based on RNase R-treated samples. The software tool is available for academic uses only. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Unintended off-target mutations induced by CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases may result in unwanted consequences, which will impede the efficient applicability of this technology for genetic improvement. We have recently edited the goat genome through CRISPR/Cas9 by targeting MSTN and FGF5, which increased muscle fiber diameter and hair fiber length, respectively. Using family trio-based sequencing that allow better discrimination of variant origins, we herein generated offspring from edited goats, and sequenced the members of four family trios (gene-edited goats and their offspring) to an average of ∼36.8× coverage. This data was to systematically examined for mutation profiles using a stringent pipeline that comprehensively analyzed the sequence data for de novo single nucleotide variants, indels, and structural variants from the genome. Our results revealed that the incidence of de novo mutations in the offspring was equivalent to normal populations. We further conducted RNA sequencing using muscle and skin tissues from the offspring and control animals, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were related to muscle fiber development in muscles, skin development, and immune responses in skin tissues. Furthermore, in contrast to recently reports of Cas9 triggered p53 expression alterations in cultured cells, we provide primary evidence to show that Cas9-mediated genetic modification does not induce apparent p53 expression changes in animal tissues. This work provides adequate molecular evidence to support the reliability of conducting Cas9-mediated genome editing in large animal models for biomedicine and agriculture. © 2018 Li, Zhou, Li, Li, Ding, Li, Liu, Qu, Sonstegard, Huang, Jiang, Chen, Petersen and Wang.

N2  - Developmental neuronal remodeling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism required for precise wiring of nervous systems. Despite its fundamental role in neurodevelopment and proposed contribution to various neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we uncover the fine temporal transcriptional landscape of Drosophila mushroom body γ neurons undergoing stereotypical remodeling. Our data reveal rapid and dramatic changes in the transcriptional landscape during development. Focusing on DNA binding proteins, we identify eleven that are required for remodeling. Furthermore, we sequence developing γ neurons perturbed for three key transcription factors required for pruning. We describe a hierarchical network featuring positive and negative feedback loops. Superimposing the perturbation-seq on the developmental expression atlas highlights a framework of transcriptional modules that together drive remodeling. Overall, this study provides a broad and detailed molecular insight into the complex regulatory dynamics of developmental remodeling and thus offers a pipeline to dissect developmental processes via RNA profiling. Developmental processes are often transcriptionally regulated. Alyagor et al. dissected the transcriptional landscape of a distinct neuronal type undergoing stereotypical remodeling in fine-grained temporal resolution. Superimposing this developmental expression atlas on profiles of neurons mutant for key transcription factors revealed a hierarchical regulatory network. © 2018 The Author(s)

N2  - Testis development is a vital and tightly regulated process in mammals. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying testis development will benefit the animal reproduction industry. Expression changes in microRNA and messenger RNA in response to dynamic regulation effects have been associated with this process. However, very little is known about the roles of these molecules in yak development. Using whole-genome small RNA and messenger RNA sequencing, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the microRNA–messenger RNA interaction network expression in the testicles of Tianzhu white yaks during three developmental stages. Using Short Time-series Expression Miner analysis we identified 589 differentially expressed microRNAs (DERs) and 3383 differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DEGs) in the three age groups. A total of 93 unique DEGs are primarily involved in reproduction and testis development. Subsequently, four integration networks were constructed according to the DEGs and DERs in three biological processes. Nineteen DEGs were potentially regulated by 60 DERs, of which miR-574 and target gene AURKA played a crucial role in yak testis development and reproduction. The results of this study provide a basis for further exploration of the microRNA–messenger RNA interactions in testis development and reproduction and aid in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of spermatogenesis in male mammals. © 2018 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an orphan disease that is difficult to treat using traditional chemotherapy, an approach which has been effective in other types of cancer. Most chemotherapeutics cause DNA damage leading to cell death. Recent discoveries have highlighted a potential role for the p53 tumor suppressor in this disease. Given the pivotal role of p53 in the DNA damage response, here we investigated the predictive power of the p53 interactome model for MPM patients' stratification. Methods: We used bioinformatics approaches including omics type analysis of data from MPM cells and from MPM patients in order to predict which pathways are crucial for patients' survival. Analysis of the PKT206 model of the p53 network was validated by microarrays from the Mero-14 MPM cell line and RNA-seq data from 71 MPM patients, whilst statistical analysis was used to identify the deregulated pathways and predict therapeutic schemes by linking the affected pathway with the patients' clinical state. Results: In silico simulations demonstrated successful predictions ranging from 52 to 85% depending on the drug, algorithm or sample used for validation. Clinical outcomes of individual patients stratified in three groups and simulation comparisons identified 30 genes that correlated with survival. In patients carrying wild-type p53 either treated or not treated with chemotherapy, FEN1 and MMP2 exhibited the highest inverse correlation, whereas in untreated patients bearing mutated p53, SIAH1 negatively correlated with survival. Numerous repositioned and experimental drugs targeting FEN1 and MMP2 were identified and selected drugs tested. Epinephrine and myricetin, which target FEN1, have shown cytotoxic effect on Mero-14 cells whereas marimastat and batimastat, which target MMP2 demonstrated a modest but significant inhibitory effect on MPM cell migration. Finally, 8 genes displayed correlation with disease stage, which may have diagnostic implications. Conclusions: Clinical decisions related to MPM personalized therapy based on individual patients' genetic profile and previous chemotherapeutic treatment could be reached using computational tools and the predictions reported in this study upon further testing in animal models. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in the goose embryo transcriptome during feather development. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to find the transcriptome profiles of feather follicles from three stages of embryonic dorsal skin at embryonic day 13, 18, and 28 (E13, E18, E28). The results showed that 3001, 6634, and 13,780 genes were differently expressed in three stages. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in E13 vs. E18 were significantly mapped into the GO term of extracellular structure organization and the pathway of extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction. In E18 vs. E28, the top significantly mapped into GO term was the single-organism developmental process; the pathway was also the ECM-receptor interaction. DEGs in E13 vs. E28 were significantly mapped into the GO term of the multicellular organismal process and the pathway of cell adhesion molecules. Subsequently, the union of DEGs was categorized by succession cluster into eight profiles, which were then grouped into four ideal profiles. Lastly, the seven genes spatio-temporal expression pattern was confirmed by real-time PCR. Our findings advocate that interleukin 20 receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA), interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R), interleukin 1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), Wnt family member 3A (WNT3A), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7), and secreted-frizzled related protein 2 (SFRP2) might possibly play vital roles in skin and feather follicle development and growth processes. © 2018 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Detection of copy number variants (CNVs) is an important aspect of clinical testing for several disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and is often performed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). However, since many genetic carrier screens depend instead on next-generation sequencing (NGS) for wider discovery of small variants, they often do not include CNV analysis. Moreover, most computational techniques developed to detect CNVs from exome sequencing data are not suitable for carrier screening, as they require matched normals, very large cohorts, or extensive gene panels. Methods: We present a computational software package, geneCNV (http://github.com/vkozareva/geneCNV), which can identify exon-level CNVs using exome sequencing data from only a few genes. The tool relies on a hierarchical parametric model trained on a small cohort of reference samples. Results: Using geneCNV, we accurately inferred heterozygous CNVs in the DMD gene across a cohort of 15 test subjects. These results were validated against MLPA, the current standard for clinical CNV analysis in DMD. We also benchmarked the tool's performance against other computational techniques and found comparable or improved CNV detection in DMD using data from panels ranging from 4,000 genes to as few as 8 genes. Conclusions: geneCNV allows for the creation of cost-effective screening panels by allowing NGS sequencing approaches to generate results equivalent to bespoke genotyping assays like MLPA. By using a parametric model to detect CNVs, it also fulfills regulatory requirements to define a reference range for a genetic test. It is freely available and can be incorporated into any Illumina sequencing pipeline to create clinical assays for detection of exon duplications and deletions. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Whole-genome sequencing is increasingly used to identify Mendelian variants in clinical pipelines. These pipelines focus on single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and also structural variants, while ignoring more complex repeat sequence variants. Here, we consider the problem of genotyping Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs), composed of inexact tandem duplications of short (6-100 bp) repeating units. VNTRs span 3% of the human genome, are frequently present in coding regions, and have been implicated in multiple Mendelian disorders. Although existing tools recognize VNTR carrying sequence, genotyping VNTRs (determining repeat unit count and sequence variation) from whole-genome sequencing reads remains challenging. We describe a method, adVNTR, that uses hidden Markov models to model each VNTR, count repeat units, and detect sequence variation. adVNTR models can be developed for short-read (Illumina) and single-molecule (Pacific Biosciences [PacBio]) whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, and show good results on multiple simulated and real data sets. © 2018 Zhang et al.

N2  - Importance: Dual anti-HER2 blockade increased the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in the Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimisation (NeoALTTO) trial, and high immune gene expression was associated with pCR in all treatment arms. So far, no marker has been identified that is specifically associated with the benefit from dual HER2 blockade. Objective: To examine if use of the T-cell β chain variable genes adds to the potential association of immune gene signatures with response to dual HER2 blockade. Design, Setting, and Participants: In the NeoALTTO trial, HER2-positive patients recruited between January 5, 2008, and May 27, 2010, were treated with paclitaxel plus either lapatinib or trastuzumab or both as neoadjuvant therapy. In this study, RNA sequencing data from baseline tumor specimens of 245 patients in the NeoALTTO trial were analyzed and reads were aligned to TRBV gene reference sequences using a previously published Basic Local Alignment Search Tool T-cell receptor mapping pipeline. Total TRBV gene use, Shannon entropy, and gene richness were calculated for each tumor, and nonnegative matrix factorization was used to define TRBV co-use metagenes (TMGs). The association between TRBV metrics, tumor genomic metrics, and response was assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Statistical analysis was performed from January 23 to December 2, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between TRBV use metrics and pCR. Results: Among the 245 women with available data (mean [SD] age, 49 [11] years), total TRBV use correlated positively with a gene expression signature for immune activity (Spearman ρ = 0.93; P < .001). High use of TRBV11-3 and TMG2, characterized by high use of TRBV4.3, TRBV6.3, and TRBV7.2, was associated with a higher rate of pCR to dual HER2-targeted therapy (TRBV11-3 interaction: odds ratio, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.22-6.47]; P = .02; TMG2 interaction: odds ratio, 3.39 [95% CI, 1.57-8.27]; P = .004). Immune-rich cancers with high TMG2 levels (n = 92) had significantly better response to dual HER2-targeted treatment compared with the single therapy arms (rate of pCR, 68% [95% CI, 52%-83%] vs 21% [95% CI, 10%-31%]; P < .001), whereas those with low TMG2 levels did not benefit from dual therapy. High TMG2 levels were also associated with a higher rate of pCR to the combined therapy in immune-poor tumors (n = 30; pCR, 50% [95% CI, 22%-78%] vs 6% [95% CI, 0%-16%]; P = .009). Conclusions and Relevance: Use patterns of TRBV genes potentially provide information about the association with response to dual HER2 blockade beyond immune gene signatures. High use of TRBV11.3 or TRBV4.3, TRBV6.3, and TRBV7.2 identifies patients who have a better response to dual HER2 targeted therapy. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00553358.

N2  - Inflorescence capacity plays a crucial role in reproductive fitness in plants, and in production of hybrid crops. Maize is a monoecious species bearing separate male and female flowers (tassel and ear, respectively). The switch from open-pollinated populations of maize to hybrid-based breeding schemes in the early 20th century was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in tassel size, and the trend has continued with modern breeding over the recent decades. The goal of this study was to identify selection signatures in genes that may underlie this dramatic transformation. Using a population of 942 diverse inbred maize accessions and a nested association mapping population comprising three 200-line biparental populations, we measured 15 tassel morphological characteristics by manual and image-based methods. Genome-wide association studies identified 242 single nucleotide polymor-phisms significantly associated with measured traits. We compared 41 unselected lines from the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS) population to 21 highly selected lines developed by modern commercial breeding programs, and found that tassel size and weight were reduced significantly. We assayed genetic differences between the two groups using three selection statistics: cross population extended haplotype homozogysity, cross-population composite likelihood ratio, and fixation index. All three statistics show evidence of selection at genomic regions associated with tassel morphology relative to genome-wide null distributions. These results support the tremendous effect, both phenotypic and genotypic, that selection has had on maize male inflorescence morphology. © 2018 J. L. Gage et al.

N2  - Although differential gene expression (DGE) profiling in RNA-seq is used by many researchers, new packages and pipelines are continuously being presented as a result of an ongoing investigation. In this work, a geometric approach based on Supervised Variational Relevance Learning (Suvrel) was compared with DEpackages (edgeR, DESEq, baySeq, PoissonSeq, and limma) in the DGE profiling. The Suvrel method seeks to determine the relevance of characteristics (e.g., gene or transcript) based on intraclass and interclass distances. The comparison was performed using technical and biological replicates. For technical replicates, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, while for the other ones, we used robustness analysis. From ROC analysis, we found that geometric approach had a better performance than the DEpackages. Particularly, for a reduced list of differentially expressed genes (DEG), we noticed that this method had a remarkable advantage in ranking of most DEG (with a specificity ranging from 1 to 0.8). From robustness analysis associated to biological replicates, we found that geometric approach has comparable performance to the DEpackages. We conclude that the geometric approach had a slight overall better performance than the other methods. Moreover, it is a simple method that does not make any assumption about the distribution associated with RNA-seq data set. From this perspective, the relevance of this study was to show that a simple method can provide as good performance as more complex methods. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018.

N2  - With the increasing number of studies focusing on PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNAs), it is now pertinent to develop efficient tools dedicated towards piRNA analysis. We have developed a novel cluster prediction tool called PILFER (PIrna cLuster FindER), which can accurately predict piRNA clusters from small RNA sequencing data. PILFER is an open source, easy to use tool, and can be executed even on a personal computer with minimum resources. It uses a sliding-window mechanism by integrating the expression of the reads along with the spatial information to predict the piRNA clusters. We have additionally defined a piRNA analysis pipeline incorporating PILFER to detect and annotate piRNAs and their clusters from raw small RNA sequencing data and implemented it on publicly available data from healthy germline and somatic tissues. We compared PILFER with other existing piRNA cluster prediction tools and found it to be statistically more accurate and superior in many aspects such as the robustness of PILFER clusters is higher and memory efficiency is more. Overall, PILFER provides a fast and accurate solution to piRNA cluster prediction. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Multi-region sequencing is used to detect intratumor genetic heterogeneity (ITGH) in tumors. To assess whether genuine ITGH can be distinguished from sequencing artifacts, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on three anatomically distinct regions of the same tumor with technical replicates to estimate technical noise. Somatic variants were detected with three different WES pipelines and subsequently validated by high-depth amplicon sequencing. The cancer-only pipeline was unreliable, with about 69% of the identified somatic variants being false positive. Even with matched normal DNA for which 82% of the somatic variants were detected reliably, only 36%–78% were found consistently in technical replicate pairs. Overall, 34%–80% of the discordant somatic variants, which could be interpreted as ITGH, were found to constitute technical noise. Excluding mutations affecting low-mappability regions or occurring in certain mutational contexts was found to reduce artifacts, yet detection of subclonal mutations by WES in the absence of orthogonal validation remains unreliable. Shi et al. report that standard coverage whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines cannot discriminate between genuine intratumor genetic heterogeneity and sequencing artifacts. Although aggressive minimum depth filtering would not improve the false detection rate of subclonal mutations, excluding mutations in low-mappability regions or in certain mutational contexts could help. © 2018 The Author(s)

N2  - Background: A widely applied approach to extract knowledge from high-throughput genomic data is clustering of gene expression profiles followed by functional enrichment analysis. This type of analysis, when done manually, is highly subjective and has limited reproducibility. Moreover, this pipeline can be very time-consuming and resource-demanding as enrichment analysis is done for tens to hundreds of clusters at a time. Thus, the task often needs programming skills to form a pipeline of different software tools or R packages to enable an automated approach. Furthermore, visualising the results can be challenging. Results: We developed a web tool, funcExplorer, which automatically combines hierarchical clustering and enrichment analysis to detect functionally related gene clusters. The functional characterisation is achieved using structured knowledge from data sources such as Gene Ontology, KEGG and Reactome pathways, Human Protein Atlas, and Human Phenotype Ontology. funcExplorer includes various measures for finding biologically meaningful clusters, provides a modern graphical user interface, and has wide-ranging data export and sharing options as well as software transparency by open-source code. The results are presented in a visually compact and interactive format, enabling users to explore the biological essence of the data. We compared our results with previously published gene clusters to demonstrate that funcExplorer can perform the data characterisation equally well, but without requiring labour-intensive manual interference. Conclusions: The open-source web tool funcExplorer enables scientists with high-throughput genomic data to obtain a preliminary interactive overview of the expression patterns, gene names, and shared functionalities in their dataset in a visually pleasing format. funcExplorer is publicly available at https://biit.cs.ut.ee/funcexplorer © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Motivation In recent years, Transposable Elements (TEs) have been related to gene regulation. However, estimating the origin of expression of TEs through RNA-seq is complicated by multi-mapping reads coming from their repetitive sequences. Current approaches that address multi-mapping reads are focused in expression quantification and not in finding the origin of expression. Addressing the genomic origin of expressed TEs could further aid in understanding the role that TEs might have in the cell. Results We have developed a new pipeline called TEcandidates, based on de novo transcriptome assembly to assess the instances of TEs being expressed, along with their location, to include in downstream DE analysis. TEcandidates takes as input the RNA-seq data, the genome sequence and the TE annotation file and returns a list of coordinates of candidate TEs being expressed, the TEs that have been removed and the genome sequence with removed TEs as masked. This masked genome is suited to include TEs in downstream expression analysis, as the ambiguity of reads coming from TEs is significantly reduced in the mapping step of the analysis.

N2  - Motivation Alternative splicing (AS) has been demonstrated to play a role in shaping eukaryotic gene diversity at the transcriptional level. However, the impact of AS on the proteome is still controversial. Studies that seek to explore the effect of AS at the proteomic level are hampered by technical difficulties in the cumbersome process of casting forth and back between genome, transcriptome and proteome space coordinates, and the naïve prediction of protein domains in the presence of AS suffers many redundant sequence scans that emerge from constitutively spliced regions that are shared between alternative products of a gene. Results We developed the AstaFunk pipeline that computes for every generic transcriptome all domains that are altered by AS events in a systematic and efficient manner. In a nutshell, our method employs Viterbi dynamic programming, which guarantees to find all score-optimal hits of the domains under consideration, while complementary optimizations at different levels avoid redundant and other irrelevant computations. We evaluate AstaFunk qualitatively and quantitatively using RNAseq in well-studied genes with AS, and on large-scale employing entire transcriptomes. Our study confirms complementary reports that the effect of most AS events on the proteome seems to be rather limited, but our results also pinpoint several cases where AS could have a major impact on the function of a protein domain.

N2  - Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is characterized by extensive lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary and lacrimal gland (LG), resulting in acinar cell destruction and organ dysfunction. The underlying pathogenesis of SS remains largely unknown, and studies historically focus on defining late-stage disease. Here, we identify tissue programs associated with disease onset using transcriptomic and immunohistological analysis of LGs from 5-and 7-week-old mice deficient in autoimmune response element (Aire). At 5 weeks of age (wk), Aire-/-mice show minimal tissue dysfunction and destruction compared to 7 wk Aire-/-, which exhibit severe dry eye, poor tear secretion, extensive lymphocytic infiltration, reduced functional innervation, and increased vascularization. Despite this mild phenotype, 5 wk Aire-/-LGs were highly enriched for signaling pathways previously associated with SS, including interferon gamma (IFNγ), interleukin 1 beta (IL1β), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, and interleukin-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL6/STAT3) signaling. Novel signaling pathways such as the semaphorin–plexin pathway were also noted. Intriguingly, we found an expansion of the ductal network with increasing disease. Activated STAT3, a blocker of apoptosis, was restricted to the ductal system and also increased with damage, highlighting its potential as a promoter of ductal cell survival. These data demonstrate the early activation of signaling pathways regulating inflammation, innervation, and cell survival before the onset of clinical disease indicators, suggesting their potential value as diagnostic biomarkers. © 2018 by the authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and have been targeted as indicators of environmental/toxicologic stressors. Using the data from our deep sequencing of miRNAs in an extensive sampling of rat tissues, we developed a database called RATEmiRs for the Rat Atlas of Tissue-specific and Enriched miRNAs to allow users to dynamically determine mature-, iso- and pre-miR expression abundance, enrichment and specificity in rat tissues and organs. RESULTS: Illumina sequencing count data from mapped reads and meta data from the miRNA body atlas consisting of 21 and 23 tissues (14 organs) of toxicologic interest from 12 to 13 week old male and female Sprague Dawley rats respectively, were managed in a relational database with a user-friendly query interface. Data-driven pipelines are available to tailor the identification of tissue-enriched (TE) and tissue-specific (TS) miRNAs. Data-driven organ-specific (OS) pipelines reveal miRNAs that are expressed predominately in a given organ. A user-driven approach is also available to assess the tissue expression of user-specified miRNAs. Using one tissue vs other tissues and tissue(s) of an organ vs other organs, we illustrate the utility of RATEmiRs to facilitate the identification of candidate miRNAs. As a use case example, RATEmiRs revealed two TS miRNAs in the liver: rno-miR-122-3p and rno-miR-122-5p. When liver is compared to just the brain tissues for example, rno-miR-192-5p, rno-miR-193-3p, rno-miR-203b-3p, rno-miR-3559-5p, rno-miR-802-3p and rno-miR-802-5p are also detected as abundantly expressed in liver. As another example, 55 miRNAs from the RATEmiRs query of ileum vs brain tissues overlapped with miRNAs identified from the same comparison of tissues in an independent, publicly available dataset of 10 week old male rat microarray data suggesting that these miRNAs are likely not age-specific, platform-specific nor pipeline-dependent. Lastly, we identified 10 miRNAs that have conserved tissue/organ-specific expression between the rat and human species. CONCLUSIONS: RATEmiRs provides a new platform for identification of TE, TS and OS miRNAs in a broad array of rat tissues. RATEmiRs is available at: https://www.niehs.nih.gov/ratemirs.

N2  - Background: The potential for astrocyte participation in central nervous system recovery is highlighted by in vitro experiments demonstrating their capacity to transdifferentiate into neurons. Understanding astrocyte plasticity could be advanced by comparing astrocytes with stem cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is ideal for comparing differences across cell types. However, this novel multi-stage process has the potential to introduce unwanted technical variation at several points in the experimental workflow. Quantitative understanding of the contribution of experimental parameters to technical variation would facilitate the design of robust RNA-Seq experiments. Results: RNA-Seq was used to achieve biological and technical objectives. The biological aspect compared gene expression between normal human fetal-derived astrocytes and human neural stem cells cultured in identical conditions. When differential expression threshold criteria of |log 2 fold change|&gt;2 were applied to the data, no significant differences were observed. The technical component quantified variation arising from particular steps in the research pathway, and compared the ability of different normalization methods to reduce unwanted variance. To facilitate this objective, a liberal false discovery rate of 10% and a |log 2 fold change|&gt;0.5 were implemented for the differential expression threshold. Data were normalized with RPKM, TMM, and UQS methods using JMP Genomics. The contributions of key replicable experimental parameters (cell lot; library preparation; flow cell) to variance in the data were evaluated using principal variance component analysis. Our analysis showed that, although the variance for every parameter is strongly influenced by the normalization method, the largest contributor to technical variance was library preparation. The ability to detect differentially expressed genes was also affected by normalization; differences were only detected in non-normalized and TMM-normalized data. Conclusions: The similarity in gene expression between astrocytes and neural stem cells supports the potential for astrocytic transdifferentiation into neurons, and emphasizes the need to evaluate the therapeutic potential of astrocytes for central nervous system damage. The choice of normalization method influences the contributions to experimental variance as well as the outcomes of differential expression analysis. However irrespective of normalization method, our findings illustrate that library preparation contributed the largest component of technical variance. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Testing the dependence of two variables is one of the fundamental tasks in statistics. In this work, we developed an open-source R package (knnAUC) for detecting nonlinear dependence between one continuous variable X and one binary dependent variables Y (0 or 1). Results: We addressed this problem by using knnAUC (k-nearest neighbors AUC test, the R package is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/knnauc/ ). In the knnAUC software framework, we first resampled a dataset to get the training and testing dataset according to the sample ratio (from 0 to 1), and then constructed a k-nearest neighbors algorithm classifier to get the yhat estimator (the probability of y=1) of testy (the true label of testing dataset). Finally, we calculated the AUC (area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic) estimator and tested whether the AUC estimator is greater than 0.5. To evaluate the advantages of knnAUC compared to seven other popular methods, we performed extensive simulations to explore the relationships between eight different methods and compared the false positive rates and statistical power using both simulated and real datasets (Chronic hepatitis B datasets and kidney cancer RNA-seq datasets). Conclusions: We concluded that knnAUC is an efficient R package to test non-linear dependence between one continuous variable and one binary dependent variable especially in computational biology area. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Plasmodium falciparum exhibits resistance to the artemisinin component of the frontline antimalarial treatment Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy in South East Asia. Millions of lives will be at risk if artemisinin resistance (ART-R) spreads to Africa. Single non-synonymous mutations in the propeller region of PF3D7-1343700,"K13" are implicated in resistance. In this work, we use transcriptional profiling to characterize a laboratory-generated k13 insertional mutant previously demonstrated to have increased sensitivity to artemisinins to explore the functional role of k13. Results: A set of RNA-seq and microarray experiments confirmed that the expression profile of k13 is specifically altered during the early ring and early trophozoite stages of the mutant intraerythrocytic development cycle. The down-regulation of k13 transcripts in this mutant during the early ring stage is associated with a transcriptome advance towards a more trophozoite-like state. To discover the specific downstream effect of k13 dysregulation, we developed a new computational method to search for differential gene expression while accounting for the temporal sequence of transcription. We found that the strongest biological signature of the transcriptome shift is an up-regulation of DNA replication and repair genes during the early ring developmental stage and a down-regulation of DNA replication and repair genes during the early trophozoite stage; by contrast, the expressions of housekeeping genes are unchanged. This effect, due to k13 dysregulation, is antagonistic, such that k13 levels are negatively correlated with DNA replication and repair gene expression. Conclusion: Our results support a role for k13 as a stress response regulator consistent with the hypothesis that artemisinins mode of action is oxidative stress and k13 as a functional homolog of Keap1 which in humans regulates DNA replication and repair genes in response to oxidative stress. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Congenital hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (CHH) is a challenging inherited endocrine disorder characterised by absent or incomplete pubertal development and infertility as a result of the low action/secretion of the hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Given a growing list of gene mutations accounting for CHH, the application of massively parallel sequencing comprises an excellent molecular diagnostic approach because it enables the simultaneous evaluation of many genes. The present study proposes the use of whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify causative and modifying mutations based on a phenotype-genotype CHH analysis using an in-house exome pipeline. Based on 44 known genes related to CHH in humans, we were able to identify a novel homozygous gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR) p.Thr269Met mutant, which segregates with the CHH kindred and was predicted to be deleterious by in silico analysis. A functional study measuring intracellular inositol phosphate (IP) when stimulated with GnRH on COS-7 cells confirmed that the p.Thr269Met GnRHR mutant performed greatly diminished IP accumulation relative to the transfected wild-type GnRHR. Additionally, the proband carries three heterozygous variants in CCDC141 and one homozygous in SEMA3A gene, although their effects with respect to modifying the phenotype are uncertain. Because they do not segregate with reproductive phenotype in family members, we advocate they do not contribute to CHH oligogenicity. WES proved to be useful for CHH molecular diagnosis and reinforced its benefit with respect to identifying heterogeneous genetic disorders. Our findings expand the GnRHR mutation spectrum and phenotype-genotype correlation in CHH. © 2018 British Society for Neuroendocrinology

N2  - Cancer is thought to arise through the accumulation of genomic aberrations evolving under Darwinian selection. However, it remains unclear when the aberrations associated with metastasis emerge during tumor evolution. Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary eye cancer and frequently leads to metastatic death, which is strongly linked to BAP1 mutations. Accordingly, UM is ideally suited for studying the clonal evolution of metastatic competence. Here we analyze sequencing data from 151 primary UM samples using a customized bioinformatic pipeline, to improve detection of BAP1 mutations and infer the clonal relationships among genomic aberrations. Strikingly, we find BAP1 mutations and other canonical genomic aberrations usually arise in an early punctuated burst, followed by neutral evolution extending to the time of clinical detection. This implies that the metastatic proclivity of UM is "set in stone" early in tumor evolution and may explain why advances in primary treatment have not improved survival. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Metastases and tumor recurrence have a major prognostic impact in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC); however, cellular models that comprehensively characterize metastatic and recurrent HNSCC are lacking. To this end, we obtained genomic, transcriptomic, and copy number profiles of the UM-SCC cell line panel, encompassing patient-matched metastatic and recurrent cells. UM-SCC cells recapitulate the most prevalent genomic alterations described in HNSCC, featuring common TP53, PI3K, NOTCH, and Hippo pathway mutations. This analysis identified a novel F977Y kinase domain PIK3CA mutation exclusively present in a recurrent cell line (UM-SCC14B), potentially conferring resistance to PI3K inhibitors. Small proline-rich protein 2A (SPRR2A), a protein involved in epithelial homeostasis and invasion, was one of the most consistently downregulated transcripts in metastatic and recurrent UM-SCC cells. Assessment of SPRR2A protein expression in a clinical cohort of patients with HNSCC confirmed common SPRR2A downregulation in primary tumors (61.9% of cases) and lymph node metastases (31.3%), but not in normal tissue. High expression of SPRR2A in lymph node metastases was, along with nonoropharyngeal location of the primary tumor, an independent prognostic factor for regional disease recurrence after surgery and radiotherapy (HR 2.81; 95% CI, 1.16–6.79; P ¼ 0.02). These results suggest that SPRR2A plays a dual role in invasion and therapeutic resistance in HNSCC, respectively through its downregulation and overexpression. Implications: The current study reveals translationally relevant mechanisms underlying metastasis and recurrence in HNSCC and represents an adjuvant tool for preclinical research in this disease setting. Underlining its discovery potential this approach identified a PIK3CA-resistant mutation as well as SPRR2A as possible theragnostic markers. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  - Neurodevelopmental disorders are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorders encompassing wide classification of intellectual disabilities (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In the present study, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in three unrelated patients with developmental delay, hypotonia and ID. We found novel heterozygous mutations in two ID and ASD associated genes namely POGZ and KMT2D (c.1918C>CT (p.R640RC) in the POGZ, c.14531 delG (p.G4844Vfs*13) and c.13818C>CG (p.Y4606YX) in the KMT2D genes). Segregation analysis showed all three mutations are de novo mutations. Our data add information to the available literature and enlightens a new era of genotype-phenotype correlation. Molecular genetic testing will accelerate and simplify genetic counseling and promote accurate and immediate prognostic information allowing patients to benefit from precise diagnosis and risk assessment schemes for further conception. © 2018

N2  - Knowledge of connections between operational conditions, process stability, and microbial community dynamics is essential to enhance anaerobic digestion (AD) process efficiency and management. In this study, the detailed temporal effects of a sudden glycerol-based organic overloading on the AD microbial community and process imbalance were investigated in two replicate anaerobic digesters by a time-intensive sampling scheme. The microbial community time response to the overloading event was shorter than the shifts of reactor performance parameters. An increase in bacterial community dynamics and in the abundances of several microbial taxa, mainly within the Firmicutes, Tenericutes, and Chloroflexi phyla and Methanoculleus genera, could be detected prior to any shift on the reactor operational parameters. Reactor acidification already started within the first 24 h of the shock and headed the AD process to total inhibition in 72 h alongside with the largest shifts on microbiome, mostly the increase of Anaerosinus sp. and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic Archaea. In sum, this work proved that AD microbial community reacts very quickly to an organic overloading and some shifts occur prior to alterations on the performance parameters. The latter is very interesting as it can be used to improve AD process management protocols. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Argonaute crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments are the most widely used high-throughput methodologies for miRNA targetome characterization. The analysis of Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside-Enhanced (PAR) CLIP methodology focuses on sequence clusters containing T-to-C conversions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the non-T-to-C clusters, frequently observed in PAR-CLIP experiments, exhibit functional miRNA-binding events and strong RNA accessibility. This discovery is based on the analysis of an extensive compendium of bona fide miRNA-binding events, and is further supported by numerous miRNA perturbation experiments and structural sequencing data. The incorporation of these previously neglected clusters yields an average of 14% increase in miRNA-target interactions per PAR-CLIP library. Our findings are integrated in microCLIP (www.microrna.gr/microCLIP), a cutting-edge framework that combines deep learning classifiers under a super learning scheme. The increased performance of microCLIP in CLIP-Seq-guided detection of miRNA interactions, uncovers previously elusive regulatory events and miRNA-controlled pathways. © 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - The biological determinants of sensitivity and resistance to immune checkpoint blockers are not completely understood. To elucidate the role of intratumoral T-cells and their association with the tumor genomic landscape, we perform paired whole exome DNA sequencing and multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) in pre-treatment samples from non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients treated with PD-1 axis blockers. QIF is used to simultaneously measure the level of CD3+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), in situ T-cell proliferation (Ki-67 in CD3) and effector capacity (Granzyme-B in CD3). Elevated mutational load, candidate class-I neoantigens or intratumoral CD3 signal are significantly associated with favorable response to therapy. Additionally, a “dormant” TIL signature is associated with survival benefit in patients treated with immune checkpoint blockers characterized by elevated TILs with low activation and proliferation. We further demonstrate that dormant TILs can be reinvigorated upon PD-1 blockade in a patient-derived xenograft model. © 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that infect humans and animals. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been applied as a live vaccine for immunization against smallpox, which was eradicated by 1980 as a result of worldwide vaccination. VACV is the prototype of poxviruses in the investigation of the molecular pathogenesis of the virus. Short-read sequencing methods have revolutionized transcriptomics; however, they are not efficient in distinguishing between the RNA isoforms and transcript overlaps. Long-read sequencing (LRS) is much better suited to solve these problems and also allow direct RNA sequencing. Despite the scientific relevance of VACV, no LRS data have been generated for the viral transcriptome to date. Findings: For the deep characterization of the VACV RNA profile, various LRS platforms and library preparation approaches were applied. The raw reads were mapped to the VACV reference genome and also to the host (Chlorocebus sabaeus) genome. In this study, we applied the Pacific Biosciences RSII and Sequel platforms, which altogether resulted in 937,531 mapped reads of inserts (1.42 Gb), while we obtained 2,160,348 aligned reads (1.75 Gb) from the different library preparation methods using the MinION device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Conclusions: By applying cutting-edge technologies, we were able to generate a large dataset that can serve as a valuable resource for the investigation of the dynamic VACV transcriptome, the virus-host interactions, and RNA base modifications. These data can provide useful information for novel gene annotations in the VACV genome. Our dataset can also be used to analyze the currently available LRS platforms, library preparation methods, and bioinformatics pipelines.

N2  - Knowing which proteins and RNAs directly interact is essential for understanding cellular mechanisms. Unfortunately, discovering such interactions is costly and often unreliable. To overcome these limitations, we developed rec-YnH, a new yeast two and three-hybrid-based screening pipeline capable of detecting interactions within protein libraries or between protein libraries and RNA fragment pools. rec-YnH combines batch cloning and transformation with intracellular homologous recombination to generate bait–prey fusion libraries. By developing interaction selection in liquid–gels and using an ORF sequence-based readout of interactions via next-generation sequencing, we eliminate laborious plating and barcoding steps required by existing methods. We use rec-Y2H to simultaneously map interactions of protein domains and reveal novel putative interactors of PAR proteins. We further employ rec-Y2H to predict the architecture of published coprecipitated complexes. Finally, we use rec-Y3H to map interactions between multiple RNA-binding proteins and RNAs—the first time interactions between protein and RNA pools are simultaneously detected. © 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - Understanding metabolic dysregulation in different disease settings is vital for the safe and effective incorporation of metabolism-targeted therapeutics in the clinic. Here, using transcriptomic data for 10,704 tumor and normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, across 26 disease sites, we present a novel bioinformatics pipeline that distinguishes tumor from normal tissues, based on differential gene expression for 114 metabolic pathways. We confirm pathway dysregulation in separate patient populations, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. Bootstrapping simulations were then applied to assess the biological significance of these alterations. We provide distinct examples of the types of analysis that can be accomplished with this tool to understand cancer specific metabolic dysregulation, highlighting novel pathways of interest, and patterns of metabolic flux, in both common and rare disease sites. Further, we show that Master Metabolic Transcriptional Regulators explain why metabolic differences exist, can segregate patient populations, and predict responders to different metabolism-targeted therapeutics. © 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - We introduce the CDRP (Concatenated Diagnostic-Relapse Prognostic) architecture for multi-task deep learning that incorporates a clinical algorithm, e.g., a risk stratification schema to improve prognostic profiling. We present the first application to survival prediction in High-Risk (HR) Neuroblastoma from transcriptomics data, a task that studies from the MAQC consortium have shown to remain the hardest among multiple diagnostic and prognostic endpoints predictable from the same dataset. To obtain a more accurate risk stratification needed for appropriate treatment strategies, CDRP combines a first component (CDRP-A) synthesizing a diagnostic task and a second component (CDRP-N) dedicated to one or more prognostic tasks. The approach leverages the advent of semi-supervised deep learning structures that can flexibly integrate multimodal data or internally create multiple processing paths. CDRP-A is an autoencoder trained on gene expression on the HR/non-HR risk stratification by the Children’s Oncology Group, obtaining a 64-node representation in the bottleneck layer. CDRP-N is a multi-task classifier for two prognostic endpoints, i.e., Event-Free Survival (EFS) and Overall Survival (OS). CDRP-A provides the HR embedding input to the CDRP-N shared layer, from which two branches depart to model EFS and OS, respectively. To control for selection bias, CDRP is trained and evaluated using a Data Analysis Protocol (DAP) developed within the MAQC initiative. CDRP was applied on Illumina RNA-Seq of 498 Neuroblastoma patients (HR: 176) from the SEQC study (12,464 Entrez genes) and on Affymetrix Human Exon Array expression profiles (17,450 genes) of 247 primary diagnostic Neuroblastoma of the TARGET NBL cohort. On the SEQC HR patients, CDRP achieves Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) 0.38 for EFS and MCC = 0.19 for OS in external validation, improving over published SEQC models. We show that a CDRP-N embedding is indeed parametrically associated to increasing severity and the embedding can be used to better stratify patients’ survival. © 2018 Maggio et al.

N2  - To evaluate the potential of an integrated clinical test to detect diverse classes of somatic and germline mutations relevant to pediatric oncology, we performed three-platform whole-genome (WGS), whole exome (WES) and transcriptome (RNA-Seq) sequencing of tumors and normal tissue from 78 pediatric cancer patients in a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory. Our analysis pipeline achieves high accuracy by cross-validating variants between sequencing types, thereby removing the need for confirmatory testing, and facilitates comprehensive reporting in a clinically-relevant timeframe. Three-platform sequencing has a positive predictive value of 97–99, 99, and 91% for somatic SNVs, indels and structural variations, respectively, based on independent experimental verification of 15,225 variants. We report 240 pathogenic variants across all cases, including 84 of 86 known from previous diagnostic testing (98% sensitivity). Combined WES and RNA-Seq, the current standard for precision oncology, achieved only 78% sensitivity. These results emphasize the critical need for incorporating WGS in pediatric oncology testing. © 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) studies profile thousands of cells in heterogeneous environments. Current methods for characterizing cells perform unsupervised analysis followed by assignment using a small set of known marker genes. Such approaches are limited to a few, well characterized cell types. We developed an automated pipeline to download, process, and annotate publicly available scRNA-seq datasets to enable large scale supervised characterization. We extend supervised neural networks to obtain efficient and accurate representations for scRNA-seq data. We apply our pipeline to analyze data from over 500 different studies with over 300 unique cell types and show that supervised methods outperform unsupervised methods for cell type identification. A case study highlights the usefulness of these methods for comparing cell type distributions in healthy and diseased mice. Finally, we present scQuery, a web server which uses our neural networks and fast matching methods to determine cell types, key genes, and more. © 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides a new avenue to discover and characterize cell types; however, the experiment-specific technical biases and analytic variability inherent to current pipelines may undermine its replicability. Meta-analysis is further hampered by the use of ad hoc naming conventions. Here we demonstrate our replication framework, MetaNeighbor, that quantifies the degree to which cell types replicate across datasets, and enables rapid identification of clusters with high similarity. We first measure the replicability of neuronal identity, comparing results across eight technically and biologically diverse datasets to define best practices for more complex assessments. We then apply this to novel interneuron subtypes, finding that 24/45 subtypes have evidence of replication, which enables the identification of robust candidate marker genes. Across tasks we find that large sets of variably expressed genes can identify replicable cell types with high accuracy, suggesting a general route forward for large-scale evaluation of scRNA-seq data. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Abstract In bioinformatics, as well as other computationally intensive research fields, there is a need for workflows that can reliably produce consistent output, from known sources, independent of the software environment or configuration settings of the machine on which they are executed. Indeed, this is essential for controlled comparison between different observations and for the wider dissemination of workflows. However, providing this type of reproducibility and traceability is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which generally comes in various versions. Moreover, in many fields (bioinformatics being a prime example), these versions are subject to continual change due to rapidly evolving technologies, further complicating problems related to reproducibility. Here, we propose a principled approach for building analysis pipelines and managing their dependencies with GNU Guix. As a case study to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present a set of highly reproducible pipelines called PiGx for the analysis of RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, bisulfite-treated DNA sequencing, and single-cell resolution RNA sequencing. All pipelines process raw experimental data and generate reports containing publication-ready plots and figures, with interactive report elements and standard observables. Users may install these highly reproducible packages and apply them to their own datasets without any special computational expertise beyond the use of the command line. We hope such a toolkit will provide immediate benefit to laboratory workers wishing to process their own datasets or bioinformaticians seeking to automate all, or parts of, their analyses. In the long term, we hope our approach to reproducibility will serve as a blueprint for reproducible workflows in other areas. Our pipelines, along with their corresponding documentation and sample reports, are available at http://bioinformatics.mdc-Berlin.de/pigx. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Barcode swapping results in the mislabelling of sequencing reads between multiplexed samples on patterned flow-cell Illumina sequencing machines. This may compromise the validity of numerous genomic assays; however, the severity and consequences of barcode swapping remain poorly understood. We have used two statistical approaches to robustly quantify the fraction of swapped reads in two plate-based single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. We found that approximately 2.5% of reads were mislabelled between samples on the HiSeq 4000, which is lower than previous reports. We observed no correlation between the swapped fraction of reads and the concentration of free barcode across plates. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that barcode swapping may generate complex but artefactual cell libraries in droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing studies. To eliminate these artefacts, we have developed an algorithm to exclude individual molecules that have swapped between samples in 10x Genomics experiments, allowing the continued use of cutting-edge sequencing machines for these assays. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that can be classified into multiple subtypes based on the tumor transcriptome. Most of the subtyping schemes used in clinics today are derived from analyses of microarray data from thousands of different tumors together with clinical data for the patients from which the tumors were isolated. However, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is gradually replacing microarrays as the preferred transcriptomics platform, and although transcript abundances measured by the two different technologies are largely compatible, subtyping methods developed for probe-based microarray data are incompatible with RNA-Seq as input data. Here, we present an RNA-Seq data processing pipeline, which relies on the mapping of sequencing reads to the probe set target sequences instead of the human reference genome, thereby enabling probe-based subtyping of breast cancer tumor tissue using sequencing-based transcriptomics. By analyzing 66 breast cancer tumors for which gene expression was measured using both microarrays and RNA-Seq, we show that RNA-Seq data can be directly compared to microarray data using our pipeline. Additionally, we demonstrate that the established subtyping method CITBCMST (Guedj et al.,), which relies on a 375 probe set-signature to classify samples into the six subtypes basL, lumA, lumB, lumC, mApo, and normL, can be applied without further modifications. This pipeline enables a seamless transition to sequencing-based transcriptomics for future clinical purposes. © 2018 The Authors. Published by FEBS Press and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Background: Subterranean rodents have evolved many features to adapt to their hypoxic environment. The brain is an organ that is particularly vulnerable to damage caused by exposure to hypoxic conditions. To investigate the mechanisms of adaption to a hypoxic underground environment, we carried out a cross-species brain transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing and identified genes that are differentially expressed between the subterranean vole Lasiopodomys mandarinus and the closely related above-ground species Lasiopodomys brandtii under chronic hypoxia [10.0% oxygen (O 2 )] and normoxia (20.9% O 2 ). Results: A total of 355 million clean reads were obtained, including 69,611 unigenes in L. mandarinus and 69,360 in L. brandtii. A total of 235 and 92 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing the hypoxic and control groups of L. mandarinus and L. brandtii, respectively. A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that upregulated DEGs in both species had similar functions in response to hypoxia, whereas downregulated DEGs in L. mandarinus were enriched GO terms related to enzymes involved in aerobic reactions. In the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, upregulated DEGs in L. mandarinus were associated with angiogenesis and the increased O 2 transport capacity of red blood cells, whereas downregulated DEGs were associated with immune responses. On the other hand, upregulated DEGs in L. brandtii were associated with cell survival, vascular endothelial cell proliferation, and neuroprotection, while downregulated genes were related to the synaptic transmission by neurons. Conclusions: L. mandarinus actively adapts its physiological functions to hypoxic conditions, for instance by increasing O 2 transport capacity and modulating O 2 consumption. In contrast, L. brandtii reacts passively to hypoxia by decreasing overall activity in order to reduce O 2 consumption. These results provide insight into hypoxia adaptation mechanisms in subterranean rodents that may be applicable to humans living at high altitudes or operating in other O 2 -poor environments. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Targeted resequencing has become the most used and cost-effective approach for identifying causative mutations of Mendelian diseases both for diagnostics and research purposes. Due to very rapid technological progress, NGS laboratories are expanding their capabilities to address the increasing number of analyses. Several open source tools are available to build a generic variant calling pipeline, but a tool able to simultaneously execute multiple analyses, organize, and categorize the samples is still missing. Results: Here we describe VarGenius, a Linux based command line software able to execute customizable pipelines for the analysis of multiple targeted resequencing data using parallel computing. VarGenius provides a database to store the output of the analysis (calling quality statistics, variant annotations, internal allelic variant frequencies) and sample information (personal data, genotypes, phenotypes). VarGenius can also perform the "joint analysis" of hundreds of samples with a single command, drastically reducing the time for the configuration and execution of the analysis. VarGenius executes the standard pipeline of the Genome Analysis Tool-Kit (GATK) best practices (GBP) for germinal variant calling, annotates the variants using Annovar, and generates a user-friendly output displaying the results through a web page. VarGenius has been tested on a parallel computing cluster with 52 machines with 120GB of RAM each. Under this configuration, a 50 M whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis for a family was executed in about 7h (trio or quartet); a joint analysis of 30 WES in about 24 h and the parallel analysis of 34 single samples from a 1 M panel in about 2 h. Conclusions: We developed VarGenius, a "master" tool that faces the increasing demand of heterogeneous NGS analyses and allows maximum flexibility for downstream analyses. It paves the way to a different kind of analysis, centered on cohorts rather than on singleton. Patient and variant information are stored into the database and any output file can be accessed programmatically. VarGenius can be used for routine analyses by biomedical researchers with basic Linux skills providing additional flexibility for computational biologists to develop their own algorithms for the comparison and analysis of data.

N2  - Peripheral nerve injury is a worldwide clinical issue that impacts patients' quality of life and causes huge society and economic burden. Injured peripheral nerves are able to regenerate by themselves. However, for severe peripheral nerve injury, the regenerative abilities are very limited and the regenerative effects are very poor. A better understanding of the mechanisms following peripheral nerve injury will benefit its clinical treatment. In this study, we systematically explored the dynamic changes of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the injured sciatic nerve segments after nerve crush, identified significantly involved Gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Enrichment of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and innovatively analyzed the correlation of differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs. After the clustering of co-expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs, we performed functional analysis, selected GO term "negative regulation of cell proliferation", and constructed a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network of LIF and HMOX1 gene in this GO term. This study is the first to provide a systematic dissection of mRNA-microRNA (miRNA)-lncRNA ceRNA network following peripheral nerve injury and thus lays a foundation for further investigations of the regulating mechanisms of non-coding RNAs in peripheral nerve repair and regeneration. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Gastric cancer (GC) ranks the second in mortality rate among all cancers. Metastases account for most of the deaths in GC patients. Yet our understanding of GC and its metastasis mechanism is still very limited. Methods: We performed 20 whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 5 typical metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) patients with lymph node metastasis. We compared both the primary tumors to their metastatic lymph nodes, and a specific analysis pipeline was used to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels) and copy number variants (CNVs). Results: (1) We confirmed 30 candidate mutations in both primary and lymph nodes tissues, and other 7 only in primary tumors. (2) Copy number gains were observed in a large section of 17q12-21, as well as copy number losses in regions containing CDKN2A and CDKN2B in both primary and lymph nodes tissues. Conclusions: Our results provide preliminary insights in the molecular mechanisms of GC initiation, development, and metastatic progression. These results need to be validated through large-scale studies. © 2018 The Author(s).

Recent development in genomics technology enables transcription profiling by RNA-seq and protein's binding profiling by ChIP-seq. Integrative analysis of the two types of data allows us to investigate TFs and HMs interactions both from the genome co-localization and downstream target gene expression. Results: We propose a integrative pipeline to explore the co-localization of 55 TFs and 11 HMs and its dynamics in human GM12878 and K562 by matched ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from ENCODE. We classify TFs and HMs into three types based on their binding enrichment around transcription start site (TSS). Then a set of statistical indexes are proposed to characterize the TF-TF and TF-HM co-localizations. We found that Rad21, SMC3, and CTCF co-localized across five cell lines. High resolution Hi-C data in GM12878 shows that they associate most of the Hi-C peak loci with a specific CTCF-motif "anchor" and supports that CTCF, SMC3, and RAD2 co-localization serves important role in 3D chromatin structure. Meanwhile, 17 TF-TF pairs are highly dynamic between GM12878 and K562. We then build SVM models to correlate high and low expression level of target genes with TF binding and HM strength. We found that H3k9ac, H3k27ac, and three TFs (ELF1, TAF1, and POL2) are predictive with the accuracy about 85~92%. Conclusion: We propose a pipeline to analyze the co-localization of TF and HM and their dynamics across cell lines from ChIP-seq, and investigate their regulatory potency by RNA-seq. The integrative analysis of two level data reveals new insight for the cooperation of TFs and HMs and is helpful in understanding cell line specificity of TF/HM interactions. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - In metabolic diagnostics, there is an emerging need for a comprehensive test to acquire a complete view of metabolite status. Here, we describe a non-quantitative direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry (DI-HRMS) based metabolomics method and evaluate the method for both dried blood spots (DBS) and plasma. 110 DBS of 42 patients harboring 23 different inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and 86 plasma samples of 38 patients harboring 21 different IEM were analyzed using DI-HRMS. A peak calling pipeline developed in R programming language provided Z-scores for ~1875 mass peaks corresponding to ~3835 metabolite annotations (including isomers) per sample. Based on metabolite Z-scores, patients were assigned a ‘most probable diagnosis’ by an investigator blinded for the known diagnoses of the patients. Based on DBS sample analysis, 37/42 of the patients, corresponding to 22/23 IEM, could be correctly assigned a ‘most probable diagnosis’. Plasma sample analysis, resulted in a correct ‘most probable diagnosis’ in 32/38 of the patients, corresponding to 19/21 IEM. The added clinical value of the method was illustrated by a case wherein DI-HRMS metabolomics aided interpretation of a variant of unknown significance (VUS) identified by whole-exome sequencing. In summary, non-quantitative DI-HRMS metabolomics in DBS and plasma is a very consistent, high-throughput and nonselective method for investigating the metabolome in genetic disease. © 2019, MDPI AG.

N2  - Heavy-ion beams have been widely utilized as a novel and effective mutagen for mutation breeding in diverse plant species, but the induced mutation spectrum is not fully understood at the genome scale. We describe the development of a multiplexed and cost-efficient whole-exome sequencing procedure in rice, and its application to characterize an unselected population of heavy-ion beam-induced mutations. The bioinformatics pipeline identified single-nucleotide mutations as well as small and large (&gt;63 kb) insertions and deletions, and showed good agreement with the results obtained with conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analyses. We applied the procedure to analyze the mutation spectrum induced by heavy-ion beams at the population level. In total, 165 individual M 2 lines derived from six irradiation conditions as well as eight pools from non-irradiated ‘Nipponbare’ controls were sequenced using the newly established target exome sequencing procedure. The characteristics and distribution of carbon-ion beam-induced mutations were analyzed in the absence of bias introduced by visual mutant selections. The average (±SE) number of mutations within the target exon regions was 9.06 ± 0.37 induced by 150 Gy irradiation of dry seeds. The mutation frequency changed in parallel to the irradiation dose when dry seeds were irradiated. The total number of mutations detected by sequencing unselected M 2 lines was correlated with the conventional mutation frequency determined by the occurrence of morphological mutants. Therefore, mutation frequency may be a good indicator for sequencing-based determination of the optimal irradiation condition for induction of mutations. © 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for Experimental Biology.

N2  - Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) have been associated with genic regions in plant genomes and may play important roles in the regulation of nearby genes via recruitment of small RNAs (sRNA) to the MITEs loci. We identified eight families of MITEs in the sugarcane genome assembly with MITE-Hunter pipeline. These sequences were found to be upstream, downstream or inserted into 67 genic regions in the genome. The position of the most abundant MITE (Stowaway-like) in genic regions, which we call AddIn-MITE, was confirmed in a WD40 gene. The analysis of four monocot species showed conservation of the AddIn-MITE sequence, with a large number of copies in their genomes. We also investigated the conservation of the AddIn-MITE’ position in the WD40 genes from sorghum, maize and, in sugarcane cultivars and wild Saccharum species. In all analyzed plants, AddIn-MITE has located in WD40 intronic region. Furthermore, the role of AddIn-MITE-related sRNA in WD40 genic region was investigated. We found sRNAs preferentially mapped to the AddIn-MITE than to other regions in the WD40 gene in sugarcane. In addition, the analysis of the small RNA distribution patterns in the WD40 gene and the structure of AddIn-MITE, suggests that the MITE region is a proto-miRNA locus in sugarcane. Together, these data provide insights into the AddIn-MITE role in Andropogoneae grasses. Copyright 2019 Grativol et al.

N2  - Background: Researches on immunotherapy of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, WHO grade IV) have increased exponentially in recent years. As a targeted therapy, a series of biomarkers have been identified in local tumor tissue, while circulating marker which could be detected in the body fluids is still lacking. ADAMTSL4, a secreted glycoprotein, was earlier found to play a critical role in a prognostic signature for primary GBM (pGBM). We aimed to investigate the role of ADAMTSL4 at transcriptome level and its relationship with clinical practice in pGBM. Methods: A cohort of 88 pGBM patients with RNA-seq data from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) was analyzed, and 168 pGBM patients from TCGA were included as validation. Several bioinformatic methods and predictive tools were applied to investigate the ADAMTSL4-associated immune microenvironment status. Results: We found that ADAMTSL4 was enriched in GBM (WHO grade IV), especially for those with IDH1/2 wild-type and MGMT unmethylated groups. According to the TCGA classification scheme, ADAMTSL4 can act as a potential marker for subtypes with poorer prognosis. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that ADAMTSL4 was significantly correlated to the immune-related processes in GBM (WHO grade IV), especially representing the infiltration of immune cells and complicated tumor microenvironment. Clinically, high expression of ADAMTSL4 was an independent indicator for poor prognosis. Conclusion: The expression of ADAMTSL4 is closely related to the clinicopathologic characteristics of pGBM. Meanwhile, it may play a critical role in immune-related processes. As a secreted glycoprotein, ADAMTSL4 is a promising circulating biomarker for pGBM, deserving further investigations.

N2  - Bacterial small (sRNAs) are involved in the control of several cellular processes. Hundreds of putative sRNAs have been identified in many bacterial species through RNA sequencing. The existence of putative sRNAs is usually validated by Northern blot analysis. However, the large amount of novel putative sRNAs reported in the literature makes it impractical to validate each of them in the wet lab. In this work, we applied five machine learning approaches to construct twenty models to discriminate bona fide sRNAs from random genomic sequences in five bacterial species. Sequences were represented using seven features including free energy of their predicted secondary structure, their distances to the closest predicted promoter site and Rho-independent terminator, and their distance to the closest open reading frames (ORFs). To automatically calculate these features, we developed an sRNA Characterization Pipeline (sRNACharP). All seven features used in the classification task contributed positively to the performance of the predictive models. The best performing model obtained a median precision of 100% at 10% recall and of 64% at 40% recall across all five bacterial species, and it outperformed previous published approaches on two benchmark datasets in terms of precision and recall. Our results indicate that even though there is limited sRNA sequence conservation across different bacterial species, there are intrinsic features in the genomic context of sRNAs that are conserved across taxa. We show that these features are utilized by machine learning approaches to learn a species-independent model to prioritize bona fide bacterial sRNAs. © 2019 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.

N2  - RNAcentral is a comprehensive database of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences, collating information on ncRNA sequences of all types from a broad range of organisms. We have recently added a new genome mapping pipeline that identifies genomic locations for ncRNA sequences in 296 species. We have also added several new types of functional annotations, such as tRNA secondary structures, Gene Ontology annotations, and miRNA-Target interactions. A new quality control mechanism based on Rfam family assignments identifies potential contamination, incomplete sequences, and more. The RNAcentral database has become a vital component of many workflows in the RNA community, serving as both the primary source of sequence data for academic and commercial groups, as well as a source of stable accessions for the annotation of genomic and functional features. These examples are facilitated by an improved RNAcentral web interface, which features an updated genome browser, a new sequence feature viewer, and improved text search functionality.

N2  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are the main components of the plant innate immune system. Defensins represent the most important AMP family involved in defense and non-defense functions. In this work, global RNA sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly were performed to explore the diversity of defensin-like (DEFL) genes in the wheat Triticum kiharae and to study their role in induced resistance (IR) mediated by the elicitor metabolites of a non-pathogenic strain FS-94 of Fusarium sambucinum. Using a combination of two pipelines for DEFL mining in transcriptome data sets, as many as 143 DEFL genes were identified in T. kiharae, the vast majority of them represent novel genes. According to the number of cysteine residues and the cysteine motif, wheat DEFLs were classified into ten groups. Classical defensins with a characteristic 8-Cys motif assigned to group 1 DEFLs represent the most abundant group comprising 52 family members. DEFLs with a characteristic 4-Cys motif CX{3,5}CX{8,17}CX{4,6}C named group 4 DEFLs previously found only in legumes were discovered in wheat. Within DEFL groups, subgroups of similar sequences originated by duplication events were isolated. Variation among DEFLs within subgroups is due to amino acid substitutions and insertions/deletions of amino acid sequences. To identify IR-related DEFL genes, transcriptional changes in DEFL gene expression during elicitor-mediated IR were monitored. Transcriptional diversity of DEFL genes in wheat seedlings in response to the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, FS-94 elicitors, and the combination of both (elicitors + fungus) was demonstrated, with specific sets of up- and down-regulated DEFL genes. DEFL expression profiling allowed us to gain insight into the mode of action of the elicitors from F. sambucinum. We discovered that the elicitors up-regulated a set of 24 DEFL genes. After challenge inoculation with F. oxysporum, another set of 22 DEFLs showed enhanced expression in IR-displaying seedlings. These DEFLs, in concert with other defense molecules, are suggested to determine enhanced resistance of elicitor-pretreated wheat seedlings. In addition to providing a better understanding of the mode of action of the elicitors from FS-94 in controlling diseases, up-regulated IR-specific DEFL genes represent novel candidates for genetic transformation of plants and development of pathogen-resistant crops.

N2  - Preparation of high-quality sequencing libraries is a costly and time-consuming component of metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). While the overall cost of sequencing has dropped significantly over recent years, the reagents needed to prepare sequencing samples are likely to become the dominant expense in the process. Furthermore, libraries prepared by hand are subject to human variability and needless waste due to limitations of manual pipetting volumes. Reduction of reaction volumes, combined with sub-microliter automated dispensing of reagents without consumable pipette tips, has the potential to provide significant advantages. Here, we describe the integration of several instruments, including the Labcyte Echo 525 acoustic liquid handler and the iSeq and NovaSeq Illumina sequencing platforms, to miniaturize and automate mNGS library preparation, significantly reducing the cost and the time required to prepare samples. Through the use of External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) spike-in RNAs, we demonstrated the fidelity of the miniaturized preparation to be equivalent to full volume reactions. Furthermore, detection of viral and microbial species from cell culture and patient samples was also maintained in the miniaturized libraries. For 384-well mNGS library preparations, we achieved cost savings of over 80% in materials and reagents alone, and reduced preparation time by 90% compared to manual approaches, without compromising quality or representation within the library. © 2019 Mayday et al.

N2  - Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important worldwide crops. The genome has been available for over 10 years and has undergone several rounds of annotation. We created a comprehensive database of transcripts from 29 public RNA sequencing data sets, officially predicted genes from Ensembl plants, and common contaminants in which to search for protein-level evidence. We re-analyzed nine publicly accessible rice proteomics data sets. In total, we identified 420K peptide spectrum matches from 47K peptides and 8,187 protein groups. 4168 peptides were initially classed as putative novel peptides (not matching official genes). Following a strict filtration scheme to rule out other possible explanations, we discovered 1,584 high confidence novel peptides. The novel peptides were clustered into 692 genomic loci where our results suggest annotation improvements. 80% of the novel peptides had an ortholog match in the curated protein sequence set from at least one other plant species. For the peptides clustering in intergenic regions (and thus potentially new genes), 101 loci were identified, for which 43 had a high-confidence hit for a protein domain. Our results can be displayed as tracks on the Ensembl genome or other browsers supporting Track Hubs, to support re-annotation of the rice genome. © 2019 Varland et al.

N2  - In eukaryotes, alternative splicing (AS) greatly expands the diversity of transcripts. However, it is challenging to accurately determine full-length splicing isoforms. Recently, more studies have taken advantage of Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) long-read sequencing to identify full-length transcripts. Nevertheless, the high error rate of PacBio reads seriously offsets the advantages of long reads, especially for accurately identifying splicing junctions. To best capitalize on the features of long reads, we used Illumina RNA-seq reads to improve PacBio circular consensus sequence (CCS) quality and to validate splicing patterns in the rice transcriptome. We evaluated the impact of CCS accuracy on the number and the validation rate of splicing isoforms, and integrated a comprehensive pipeline of splicing transcripts analysis by Iso-Seq and RNA-seq (STAIR) to identify the full-length multi-exon isoforms in rice seedling transcriptome (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica). STAIR discovered 11 733 full-length multi-exon isoforms, 6599 more than the SMRT Portal RS_IsoSeq pipeline did. Of these splicing isoforms identified, 4453 (37.9%) were missed in assembled transcripts from RNA-seq reads, and 5204 (44.4%), including 268 multi-exon long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), were not reported in the MSU_osa1r7 annotation. Some randomly selected unreported splicing junctions were verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. In addition, we investigated alternative polyadenylation (APA) events in transcripts and identified 829 major polyadenylation [poly(A)] site clusters (PACs). The analysis of splicing isoforms and APA events will facilitate the annotation of the rice genome and studies on the expression and polyadenylation of AS genes in different developmental stages or growth conditions of rice. © 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - RNA sequencing allows one to study allelic imbalance of gene expression, which may be due to genetic factors or genomic imprinting (i.e., higher expression of maternal or paternal allele). It is desirable to model both genetic and parent-of-origin effects simultaneously to avoid confounding and to improve the power to detect either effect. In studies of genetically tractable model organisms, separation of genetic and parent-of-origin effects can be achieved by studying reciprocal cross of two inbred strains. In contrast, this task is much more challenging in outbred populations such as humans. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework to combine experimental strategies and novel statistical methods. Specifically, we propose to study genetic and imprinting effects in family trios with RNA-seq data from the children and genotype data from both parents and children, and quantify genetic effects by cis-eQTLs. Towards this end, we have extended our method that studies the eQTLs of RNA-seq data (Sun, Biometrics 2012, 68(1): 1–11) to model both cis-eQTL and parent-of-origin effects, and evaluated its performance using extensive simulations. Since sample size may be limited in family trios, we have developed a data analysis pipeline that borrows information from external data of unrelated individuals for cis-eQTL mapping. We have also collected RNA-seq data from the children of 30 family trios, applied our method to analyze this dataset, and identified some previously reported imprinted genes as well as some new candidates of imprinted genes. © 2019 International Biometric Society

N2  - Background: Tobacco is smoked in different form including cigarettes and water pipes. One popular form of water pipe smoking especially in Middle Eastern countries is shisha smoking. Shisha has been associated with various diseases including oral cancer. However, genomic alterations and gene expression changes associated with chronic shisha exposure have not been previously investigated. Objectives: Whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling of immortalized human oral keratinocytes (OKF6/TERT1) cells chronically treated with 0.5% shisha extract for a period of 8 months was undertaken to characterize molecular alterations associated with shisha exposure. Methods: Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and preprocessed as per manufacturer's instruction and subjected to whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. Exome was analyzed using GATK pipeline whereas RNA-Seq data was analyzed using HiSat2 and HTSeq along with DESeq to elucidate differentially expressed genes. Results: Whole-exome sequence analysis led to identification of 521 somatic missense variants corresponding to 389 genes RNA-Seq data revealed 247 differentially expressed genes (≥2-fold, P-value<0.01) in shisha treated cells compared to parental cells. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that interferon-signaling pathway was significantly affected. We predict activation of MAPK1 pathway which is known to play a key role in oral cancer. We also observed allele specific expression of mutant LIMA1 based on RNA-Seq dataset. Conclusion: Our findings provide insights into genomic alterations and gene expression pattern associated with oral keratinocytes chronically exposed to shisha. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - We proposed a data cleaning pipeline for single cell (SC) RNA-seq data, where we first screen genes (gene-wise screening) followed by screening cell libraries (library-wise screening). Gene-wise screening is based on the expectation that for a gene with a low technical noise, a gene's count in a library will tend to increase with the increase of library size, which was tested using negative binomial regression of gene count (as dependent variable) against library size (as independent variable). Library-wise screening is based on the expectation that across-library correlations for housekeeping (HK) genes is expected to be higher than the correlations for non-housekeeping (NHK) genes in those libraries with low technical noise. We removed those libraries, whose mean pairwise correlation for HK genes is NOT significantly higher than that for NHK genes. We successfully applied the pipeline to two large SC RNA-seq datasets. The pipeline was also developed into an R package. © 2019

N2  - Fusion detection in cancer is of utmost clinical importance. Dupain et al. validated a reliable tool, ChimComp, to predict their presence and oncogenicity from sequencing data, and they identified new potentially targetable fusions in a cohort of pediatric cancer patients at relapse. This will hopefully contribute to personalized medicine in cancer. © 2018 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy
We hypothetized that pediatric cancers would more likely harbor fusion transcripts. To dissect the complexity of the fusions landscape in recurrent solid pediatric cancers, we conducted a study on 48 patients with different relapsing or resistant malignancies. By analyzing RNA sequencing data with a new in-house pipeline for fusions detection named ChimComp, followed by verification by real-time PCR, we identified and classified the most confident fusion transcripts (FTs) according to their potential biological function and druggability. The majority of FTs were predicted to affect key cancer pathways and described to be involved in oncogenesis. Contrary to previous descriptions, we found no significant correlation between the number of fusions and mutations, emphasizing the particularity to study pre-treated pediatric patients. A considerable proportion of FTs containing tumor suppressor genes was detected, reflecting their importance in pediatric cancers. FTs containing non-receptor tyrosine kinases occurred at low incidence and predominantly in brain tumors. Remarkably, more than 30% of patients presented a potentially druggable high-confidence fusion. In conclusion, we detected new oncogenic FTs in relapsing pediatric cancer patients by establishing a robust pipeline that can be applied to other malignancies, to detect and prioritize experimental validation studies leading to the development of new therapeutic options. © 2018 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy

N2  - Microfluidic devices provide a low-input and efficient platform for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Existing microfluidic devices have a complicated multi-chambered structure for handling the multi-step process involved in RNA-seq and dilution between steps is used to negate the inhibitory effects among reagents. This makes the device difficult to fabricate and operate. Here we present microfluidic diffusion-based RNA-seq (MID-RNA-seq) for conducting scRNA-seq with a diffusion-based reagent swapping scheme. This device incorporates cell trapping, lysis, reverse transcription and PCR amplification all in one simple microfluidic device. MID-RNA-seq provides high data quality that is comparable to existing scRNA-seq methods while implementing a simple device design that permits multiplexing. The robustness and scalability of the MID-RNA-seq device will be important for transcriptomic studies of scarce cell samples. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Subcellular localization is a main determinant of protein function; however, a global view of cellular proteome organization remains relatively unexplored. We have developed a robust mass spectrometry-based analysis pipeline to generate a proteome-wide view of subcellular localization for proteins mapping to 12,418 individual genes across five cell lines. Based on more than 83,000 unique classifications and correlation profiling, we investigate the effect of alternative splicing and protein domains on localization, complex member co-localization, cell-type-specific localization, as well as protein relocalization after growth factor inhibition. Our analysis provides information about the cellular architecture and complexity of the spatial organization of the proteome; we show that the majority of proteins have a single main subcellular location, that alternative splicing rarely affects subcellular location, and that cell types are best distinguished by expression of proteins exposed to the surrounding environment.

N2  - Since its establishment in 2009, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been a major driver behind progress in biomedical research. In developmental biology and stem cell studies, the ability to profile single cells confers particular benefits. Although most studies still focus on individual tissues or organs, the recent development of ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq has demonstrated potential power in characterizing more complex systems or even the entire body. However, although multiple ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems have attracted attention, no systematic comparison of these systems has been performed. Here, with the same cell line and bioinformatics pipeline, we developed directly comparable datasets for each of three widely used droplet-based ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems, inDrop, Drop-seq, and 10X Genomics Chromium. Although each system is capable of profiling single-cell transcriptomes, their detailed comparison revealed the distinguishing features and suitable applications for each system. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Stemformatics is an established gene expression data portal containing over 420 public gene expression datasets derived from microarray, RNA sequencing and single cell profiling technologies. Developed for the stem cell community, it has a major focus on pluripotency, tissue stem cells, and staged differentiation. Stemformatics includes curated 'collections' of data relevant to cell reprogramming, as well as hematopoiesis and leukaemia. Rather than simply rehosting datasets as they appear in public repositories, Stemformatics uses a stringent set of quality control metrics and its own pipelines to process handpicked datasets from raw files. This means that about 30% of datasets processed by Stemformatics fail the quality controlmetrics and never make it to the portal, ensuring that Stemformatics data are of high quality and have been processed in a consistent manner. Stemformatics provides easy-to-use and intuitive tools for biologists to visually explore the data, including interactive gene expression profiles, principal component analysis plots and hierarchical clusters, among others. The addition of tools that facilitate cross-dataset comparisons provides users with snapshots of gene expression in multiple cell and tissues, assisting the identification of cell-type restricted genes, or potential housekeeping genes.

N2  - Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important component of mammalian genomes, where their numbers are even larger than that of protein-coding genes. For example, human (Homo sapiens) (96,308 vs. 20,376) and mouse (Mus musculus) (87,774 vs. 22,630) have more lncRNA genes than protein-coding genes in the NONCODEv5 database. Recently, mammalian lncRNAs were reported to play critical roles in immune response to influenza A virus infections. Such observation inspired us to identify lncRNAs related to immune response to influenza A virus in duck, which is the most important natural host of influenza A viruses. Results: We explored features of 62,447 lncRNAs from human, mouse, chicken, zebrafish and elegans, and developed a pipeline to identify lncRNAs using the identified features with transcriptomic data. We then collected 151,970 assembled transcripts from RNA-Seq data of 21 individuals from three tissues and annotated 4094 duck lncRNAs. Comparing to duck protein-coding transcripts, we found that 4094 lncRNAs had smaller number of exons (2.4 vs. 10.2) and longer length of transcripts (1903.0 bp vs. 1686.9 bp) on average. Among them, 3586 (87.6%) lncRNAs located in intergenic regions and 619 lncRNAs showed differential expression in ducks infected by H5N1 virus when compared to control individuals. 58 lncRNAs were involved into two co-expressional modules related to anti-influenza A virus immune response. Moreover, we confirmed that eight lncRNAs showed remarkably differential expression both in vivo (duck individuals) and in vitro (duck embryo fibroblast cells, DEF cells) after infected with H5N1 viruses, implying they might play important roles in response to influenza A virus infection. Conclusions: This study presented an example to annotate lncRNA in new species based on model species using transcriptome data. These data and analysis provide information for duck lncRNAs' function in immune response to influenza A virus. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Being critically important to the ecosystem, the stability of coral reefs is directly related to the marine and surrounding terrestrial environments. However, coral reefs are now undergoing massive and accelerating devastation due to bleaching. The fact that the breakdown of symbiosis between coral and the dinoflagellate, zooxanthellae, has been well elucidated as the main cause of bleaching, implying the establishment of symbiosis with zooxanthellae plays a crucial role in maintaining coral survival. However, the relevant molecular and cellular mechanisms have not been well studied yet. In this study, based on the deep RNA-sequencing data derived from Mohamed, A. R. et al., an integrated transcriptome analysis was performed to deeply investigate global transcriptome changes of the coral Acropora digitifera in response to infection by dinoflagellate of the genus Symbiodinium. Results: The results revealed that compared to RefTranscriptome-v1.0 (A. digitifera transcriptome assembly v1.0), numerous novel transcripts and isoforms were identified, the Symbiodinium-infected coral larvae at 4 h generated the highest proportion of specific isoforms. Alternative splicing analysis showed that intron retention predominated in all alternative transcripts among six statuses. Additionally, 8117 lncRNAs were predicted via a stringent stepwise filtering pipeline. A complex lncRNAs-mRNAs network including 815 lncRNAs and 6395 mRNAs were established, in which 21 lncRNAs were differentially expressed at 4 h post infection. Functional clustering analysis for those differentially lncRNAs-coexpressed mRNAs demonstrated that several biological processes and pathways related to protein kinase activity, metabolic pathways, mitochondrion, ribosome, etc. were enriched. Conclusions: Our study not only refined A. digitifera transcriptome via identification of novel transcripts and isoforms, but also predicted a high-confidence dataset of lncRNAs. Functional study based on the construction of lncRNAs-mRNAs co-expression network has disclosed a complex lncRNA-mediated regulation in response to Symbiodinium infection exhibited in A. digitifera. Once validated, these lncRNAs could be good potential targets for treatment and prevention of bleaching in coral. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - The design of synthetic cells requires a detailed understanding of the relevance of genes and gene networks underlying complex cellular phenotypes. Transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq) and constraint-based metabolic modeling can be used to probe the core genetic and metabolic networks underlying a biological process. Integrating these highly complementary experimental and in silico approaches has the potential to yield a highly comprehensive understanding of the core networks of a cell. Specifically, it can facilitate the interpretation of Tn-seq data sets and identify gaps in the data that could hinder the engineering of the cellular system, while also providing refined models for the accurate predictions of cellular metabolism. Here, we present Tn-Core, the first easy-to-use computational pipeline specifically designed for integrating Tn-seq data with metabolic modeling, prepared for use by both experimental and computational biologists. Tn-Core is a MATLAB toolbox that contains several custom functions, and it is built upon existing functions within the COBRA Toolbox and the TIGER Toolbox. Tn-Core takes as input a genome-scale metabolic model, Tn-seq data, and optionally RNA-seq data, and returns: (i) a context-specific core metabolic model; (ii) an evaluation of redundancies within core metabolic pathways, and optionally (iii) a refined genome-scale metabolic model. A simple, user-friendly workflow, requiring limited knowledge of metabolic modeling, is provided that allows users to run the analyses and export the data as easy-to-explore files of value to both experimental and computational biologists. We demonstrate the utility of Tn-Core using Sinorhizobium meliloti, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides genome-scale metabolic reconstructions as case studies. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

N2  - Background: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has been widely accepted as an essential tool in molecular biology. Reduced costs and automated analysis pipelines make the use of NGS data feasible even for small labs, yet the methods for interpreting the data are not sophisticated enough to account for the amount of information. Results: We propose s ·nr, a Visual Analytics tool that provides simple yet powerful visual interfaces for displaying and querying NGS data. It allows researchers to explore their own data in the context of experimental data deposited in public repositories, as well as to extract specific data sets with similar gene expression signatures. We tested s ·nr on 1543 RNA-Seq based mouse differential expression profiles derived from the public ArrayExpress platform. We provide the repository of processed data with this paper. Conclusion: s ·nr, easily deployable utilizing its containerized implementation, empowers researchers to analyze and relate their own RNA-Seq as well as to provide interactive and contextual crosstalk with data from public repositories. This allows users to deduce novel and unbiased hypotheses about the underlying molecular processes. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Aims: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been successfully used as a treatment for diabetic foot ulceration (DFU). Its mechanism of action on the molecular level, however, is not fully understood. We assessed the effect of NPWT on gene expression in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and DFU. Methods: We included two cohorts of patients—individuals treated with either NPWT or standard therapy. The assignment to NWPT was non-randomized and based on wound characteristics. Differential gene expression profiling was performed using Illumina gene expression arrays and R Bioconductor pipelines based on the ‘limma’ package. Results: The final cohort encompassed 21 patients treated with NPWT and 8 with standard therapy. The groups were similar in terms of age (69.0 versus 67.5 years) and duration of T2DM (14.5 versus 14.4 years). We identified four genes differentially expressed between the two study arms post-treatment, but not pre-treatment: GFRA2 (GDNF family receptor alpha-2), C1QBP (complement C1q binding protein), RAB35 (member of RAS oncogene family) and SYNJ1 (synaptic inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase 1). Interestingly, all four genes seemed to be functionally involved in wound healing by influencing re-epithelialization and angiogenesis. Subsequently, we utilized co-expression analysis in publicly available RNA-seq data to reveal the molecular functions of GFRA2 and C1QBP, which appeared to be through direct protein–protein interactions. Conclusions: We found initial evidence that the NPWT effect on DFUs may be mediated through differential gene expression. A discovery of the specific molecular mechanisms of NPWT is potentially valuable for its clinical application and development of new therapies. © 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Normal tissue samples are often employed as a control for understanding disease mechanisms, however, collecting matched normal tissues from patients is difficult in many instances. In cancer research, for example, the open cancer resources such as TCGA and TARGET do not provide matched tissue samples for every cancer or cancer subtype. The recent GTEx project has profiled samples from healthy individuals, providing an excellent resource for this field, yet the feasibility of using GTEx samples as the reference remains unanswered. Methods: We analyze RNA-Seq data processed from the same computational pipeline and systematically evaluate GTEx as a potential reference resource. We use those cancers that have adjacent normal tissues in TCGA as a benchmark for the evaluation. To correlate tumor samples and normal samples, we explore top varying genes, reduced features from principal component analysis, and encoded features from an autoencoder neural network. We first evaluate whether these methods can identify the correct tissue of origin from GTEx for a given cancer and then seek to answer whether disease expression signatures are consistent between those derived from TCGA and from GTEx. Results: Among 32 TCGA cancers, 18 cancers have less than 10 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. Among three methods, autoencoder performed the best in predicting tissue of origin, with 12 of 14 cancers correctly predicted. The reason for misclassification of two cancers is that none of normal samples from GTEx correlate well with any tumor samples in these cancers. This suggests that GTEx has matched tissues for the majority cancers, but not all. While using autoencoder to select proper normal samples for disease signature creation, we found that disease signatures derived from normal samples selected via an autoencoder from GTEx are consistent with those derived from adjacent samples from TCGA in many cases. Interestingly, choosing top 50 mostly correlated samples regardless of tissue type performed reasonably well or even better in some cancers. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that samples from GTEx can serve as reference normal samples for cancers, especially those do not have available adjacent tissue samples. A deep-learning based approach holds promise to select proper normal samples. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been linked to local immunosuppression independent of major ICI targets (e.g., PD-1). Clinical experience with response prediction based on PD-L1 expression suggests that other factors influence sensitivity to ICIs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods: Tumor specimens from 120 NSCLC patients from 10 institutions were evaluated for PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, and global proliferative profile by targeted RNA-seq. Results: Cell proliferation, derived from the mean expression of 10 proliferation-associated genes (namely BUB1, CCNB2, CDK1, CDKN3, FOXM1, KIAA0101, MAD2L1, MELK, MKI67, and TOP2A), was identified as a marker of response to ICIs in NSCLC. Poorly, moderately, and highly proliferative tumors were somewhat equally represented in NSCLC, with tumors with the highest PD-L1 expression being more frequently moderately proliferative as compared to lesser levels of PD-L1 expression. Proliferation status had an impact on survival in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. There was a significant survival advantage for moderately proliferative tumors compared to their combined highly/poorly counterparts (p = 0.021). Moderately proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors had a median survival of 14.6 months that was almost twice that of PD-L1 negative highly/poorly proliferative at 7.6 months (p = 0.028). Median survival in moderately proliferative PD-L1 negative tumors at 12.6 months was comparable to that of highly/poorly proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors at 11.5 months, but in both instances less than that of moderately proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors. Similar to survival, proliferation status has impact on disease control (DC) in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. Patients with moderately versus those with poorly or highly proliferative tumors have a superior DC rate when combined with any classification schema used to score PD-L1 as a positive result (i.e., TPS ≥ 50% or ≥ 1%), and best displayed by a DC rate for moderately proliferative tumors of no less than 40% for any classification of PD-L1 as a negative result. While there is an over representation of moderately proliferative tumors as PD-L1 expression increases this does not account for the improved survival or higher disease control rates seen in PD-L1 negative tumors. Conclusions: Cell proliferation is potentially a new biomarker of response to ICIs in NSCLC and is applicable to PD-L1 negative tumors. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - BACKGROUND: The comeasurement of both genomic and transcriptomic signatures in single cells is of fundamental importance to accurately assess how the genetic information correlates with the transcriptomic phenotype. However, existing technologies have low throughput and laborious work flows. METHODS: We developed a new method for concurrent sequencing of the transcriptome and targeted genomic regions (CORTAD-seq) within the same single cell on an automated microfluidic platform. The method was compatible with the downstream library preparation, allowing easy integration into existing next-generation sequencing work flows. We incorporated a single-cell bioinformatics pipeline for transcriptome and mutation analysis. RESULTS: As proof of principle, we applied CORTAD-seq to lung cancer cell lines to dissect the cellular consequences of mutations that result in resistance to targeted therapy. We obtained a mean detection of 6000 expressed genes and an exonic rate of 50%. The targeted DNA-sequencing data achieved a 97.8% detection rate for mutations and allowed for the identification of copy number variations and haplotype construction. We detected expression signatures of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification, and expansion of the T790M mutation among resistant cells. We also identified characteristics for TKI resistance that were independent of EGFR T790M, indicating that other alterations are required for resistance in this context. CONCLUSIONS: CORTAD-seq allows assessment of the interconnection between genetic and transcriptomic changes in single cells. It is operated on an automated, commercially available single-cell isolation platform, making its implementation straightforward. © 2018 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

N2  - N 6 -Methyladenosine (m 6 A) refers to methylation modification of the adenosine nucleotide acid at the nitrogen-6 position. Many conventional computational methods for identifying N 6 -methyladenosine sites are limited by the small amount of data available. Taking advantage of the thousands of m 6 A sites detected by high-throughput sequencing, it is now possible to discover the characteristics of m 6 A sequences using deep learning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to use word embedding and deep neural networks for m 6 A prediction from mRNA sequences. Using four deep neural networks, we developed a model inferred from a larger sequence shifting window that can predict m 6 A accurately and robustly. Four prediction schemes were built with various RNA sequence representations and optimized convolutional neural networks. The soft voting results from the four deep networks were shown to outperform all of the state-of-the-art methods. We evaluated these predictors mentioned above on a rigorous independent test data set and proved that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors. The training, independent, and cross-species testing data sets are much larger than in previous studies, which could help to avoid the problem of overfitting. Furthermore, an online prediction web server implementing the four proposed predictors has been built and is available at http://server.malab.cn/Gene2vec/. © 2019 Zou et al.

N2  - Metabolic reprogramming is a general feature of cancer cells. Regrettably, the comprehensive quantification of metabolites in biological specimens does not promptly translate into knowledge on the utilization of metabolic pathways. By estimating fluxes across metabolic pathways, computational models hold the promise to bridge this gap between data and biological functionality. These models currently portray the average behavior of cell populations however, masking the inherent heterogeneity that is part and parcel of tumorigenesis as much as drug resistance. To remove this limitation, we propose single-cell Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA) as a computational framework to translate single-cell transcriptomes into single-cell fluxomes. We show that the integration of single-cell RNA-seq profiles of cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer patients into a multi-scale stoichiometric model of a cancer cell population: significantly 1) reduces the space of feasible single-cell fluxomes; 2) allows to identify clusters of cells with different growth rates within the population; 3) points out the possible metabolic interactions among cells via exchange of metabolites.

N2  - Motivation Genomic sequencing studies, including RNA sequencing and bisulfite sequencing studies, are becoming increasingly common and increasingly large. Large genomic sequencing studies open doors for accurate molecular trait heritability estimation and powerful differential analysis. Heritability estimation and differential analysis in sequencing studies requires the development of statistical methods that can properly account for the count nature of the sequencing data and that are computationally efficient for large datasets. Results Here, we develop such a method, PQLseq (Penalized Quasi-Likelihood for sequencing count data), to enable effective and efficient heritability estimation and differential analysis using the generalized linear mixed model framework. With extensive simulations and comparisons to previous methods, we show that PQLseq is the only method currently available that can produce unbiased heritability estimates for sequencing count data. In addition, we show that PQLseq is well suited for differential analysis in large sequencing studies, providing calibrated type I error control and more power compared to the standard linear mixed model methods. Finally, we apply PQLseq to perform gene expression heritability estimation and differential expression analysis in a large RNA sequencing study in the Hutterites. Availability and implementation PQLseq is implemented as an R package with source code freely available at www.xzlab.org/software.html and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PQLseq/index.html.

Toolsets available for in-depth analysis of scRNA-seq datasets by biologists with little informatics experience is limited. Here, we describe an informatics tool (PyMINEr) that fully automates cell type identification, cell type-specific pathway analyses, graph theory-based analysis of gene regulation, and detection of autocrine-paracrine signaling networks in silico. We applied PyMINEr to interrogate human pancreatic islet scRNA-seq datasets and discovered several features of co-expression graphs, including concordance of scRNA-seq-graph structure with both protein-protein interactions and 3D genomic architecture, association of high-connectivity and low-expression genes with cell type enrichment, and potential for the graph structure to clarify potential etiologies of enigmatic disease-associated variants. We further created a consensus co-expression network and autocrine-paracrine signaling networks within and across islet cell types from seven datasets. PyMINEr correctly identified changes in BMP-WNT signaling associated with cystic fibrosis pancreatic acinar cell loss. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that the PyMINEr framework will be a valuable resource for scRNA-seq analyses. © 2019 The Author(s)

N2  - Background: Genetically engineered mice (GEM) are essential tools for understanding gene function and disease modeling. Historically, gene targeting was first done in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the 129 family of inbred strains, leading to a mixed background or congenic mice when crossed with C57BL/6 mice. Depending on the number of backcrosses and breeding strategies, genomic segments from 129-derived ESCs can be introgressed into the C57BL/6 genome, establishing a unique genetic makeup that needs characterization in order to obtain valid conclusions from experiments using GEM lines. Currently, SNP genotyping is used to detect the extent of 129-derived ESC genome introgression into C57BL/6 recipients; however, it fails to detect novel/rare variants. Results: Here, we present a computational pipeline implemented in the Galaxy platform and in BASH/R script to determine genetic introgression of GEM using next generation sequencing data (NGS), such as whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq. The pipeline includes strategies to uncover variants linked to a targeted locus, genome-wide variant visualization, and the identification of potential modifier genes. Although these methods apply to congenic mice, they can also be used to describe variants fixed by genetic drift. As a proof of principle, we analyzed publicly available RNA-Seq data from five congenic knockout (KO) lines and our own RNA-Seq data from the Sall2 KO line. Additionally, we performed target validation using several genetics approaches. Conclusions: We revealed the impact of the 129-derived ESC genome introgression on gene expression, predicted potential modifier genes, and identified potential phenotypic interference in KO lines. Our results demonstrate that our new approach is an effective method to determine genetic introgression of GEM. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Repetitive DNA sequences represent about half of the human genome. They have a central role in human biology, especially neurobiology, but are notoriously difficult to study. The purpose of this study was to quantify the transcription from repetitive sequences in a progerin-expressing cellular model of neuronal aging. Progerin is a nuclear protein causative of the Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome that is also incrementally expressed during the normal aging process. A dedicated pipeline of analysis allowed to quantify transcripts containing repetitive sequences from RNAseq datasets oblivious of their genomic localization, tolerating a sufficient degree of mutational noise, all with low computational requirements. The pipeline has been applied to a published panel of RNAseq datasets derived from a well-established and well-described cellular model of aging of dopaminergic neurons. Progerin expression strongly downregulated the transcription from all the classes of repetitive sequences: satellites, long and short interspersed nuclear elements, human endogenous retroviruses, and DNA transposon. The Alu element represented by far the principal source of transcript originating either from repetitive sequences or from canonical coding genes; it was expressed on average at 192,493.5 reads per kilobase million (RPKM) (SE = 21,081.3) in the control neurons and dropped to 43,760.1 RPKM (SE = 5315.0) in the progerin-expressing neurons, being significant downregulated (p = 0.0005). The results highlighted a global perturbation of transcripts derived from repetitive sequences in a cellular model of aging and provided a direct link between progerin expression and alteration of transcription from human repetitive elements. © 2019, American Aging Association.

N2  - The use of RNA-seq as a generalized tool to measure the differential expression of genes has essentially replaced the use of the microarray. Despite the acknowledged technical advantages to this approach, RNA-seq library preparation remains mostly conducted by core facilities rather than in the laboratory due to the infrastructure, expertise and time required per sample. We have recently described two ‘click-chemistry’ based library construction methods termed ClickSeq and Poly(A)-ClickSeq (PAC-seq) as alternatives to conventional RNA-seq that are both cost effective and rely on straightforward reagents readily available to most labs. ClickSeq is random-primed and can sequence any (unfragmented) RNA template, while PAC-seq is targeted to poly(A) tails of mRNAs. Here, we further develop PAC-seq as a platform that allows for simultaneous mapping of poly(A) sites and the measurement of differential expression of genes. We provide a detailed protocol, descriptions of appropriate computational pipelines, and a proof-of-principle dataset to illustrate the technique. PAC-seq offers a unique advantage over other 3′ end mapping protocols in that it does not require additional purification, selection, or fragmentation steps allowing sample preparation directly from crude total cellular RNA. We have shown that PAC-seq is able to accurately and sensitively count transcripts for differential gene expression analysis, as well as identify alternative poly(A) sites and determine the precise nucleotides of the poly(A) tail boundaries. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The maternal genome directs almost all aspects of early animal development. As development proceeds, the elimination of maternal gene products and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occur during the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT). To study the molecular mechanisms regulating this developmental event in Eriocheir sinensis, RNA-Seq technology was applied to generate comprehensive information on transcriptome dynamics during early embryonic stages. In total, 32,088 annotated unigenes were obtained from the transcriptomes of fertilized eggs and embryos at the cleavage (2–4 cell) and blastula stage. A total of 566 maternal genes and 1165 zygotic genes were isolated, among which 103 and 266 genes were predicted conserved maternal transcripts (COMATs) and conserved zygotic transcripts (COZYTs), respectively. The COMATs performed housekeeping gene functions and may be essential for initiating early embryogenesis of the Bilateria. Furthermore, 87, 76 and 117 differentially expressed genes associated with the MZT, morphogenesis and immunity were identified when compared the three transcriptomic datasets. We also unmask that the MZT takes place around the cleavage stage, when the genes involved in the clearance of maternal gene products and the ZGA were significantly up-regulated. Taken together, these datasets provide a valuable resource for understanding the mechanisms of early developmental events in E. sinensis, and facilitate further studies on molecular mechanisms of asynchronous development in crabs. © 2018

N2  - Backgrounds: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is now widely used in biomedical research for various applications. Processing of NGS data requires multiple programs and customization of the processing pipelines according to the data platforms. However, rapid progress of the NGS applications and processing methods urgently require prompt update of the pipelines. Recent clinical applications of NGS technology such as cell-free DNA, cancer panel, or exosomal RNA sequencing data also require appropriate customization of the processing pipelines. Here, we developed SEQprocess, a highly extendable framework that can provide standard as well as customized pipelines for NGS data processing. Results: SEQprocess was implemented in an R package with fully modularized steps for data processing that can be easily customized. Currently, six pre-customized pipelines are provided that can be easily executed by non-experts such as biomedical scientists, including the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) pipelines as well as the popularly used pipelines for variant calling (e.g., GATK) and estimation of allele frequency, RNA abundance (e.g., TopHat2/Cufflink), or DNA copy numbers (e.g., Sequenza). In addition, optimized pipelines for the clinical sequencing from cell-free DNA or miR-Seq are also provided. The processed data were transformed into R package-compatible data type 'ExpressionSet' or 'SummarizedExperiment', which could facilitate subsequent data analysis within R environment. Finally, an automated report summarizing the processing steps are also provided to ensure reproducibility of the NGS data analysis. Conclusion: SEQprocess provides a highly extendable and R compatible framework that can manage customized and reproducible pipelines for handling multiple legacy NGS processing tools. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) is a powerful method to examine chromatin accessibility. While many studies have reported a positive correlation between gene expression and promoter accessibility, few have investigated the genes that deviate from this trend. In this study, we aimed to understand the relationship between gene expression and promoter accessibility in multiple cell types while also identifying gene regulatory networks in the placenta, an understudied organ that is critical for a successful pregnancy. Results: We started by assaying the open chromatin landscape in the mid-gestation placenta, when the fetal vasculature has started developing. After incorporating transcriptomic data generated in the placenta at the same time point, we grouped genes based on their expression levels and ATAC-seq promoter coverage. We found that the genes with the strongest correlation (high expression and high coverage) are likely involved in housekeeping functions, whereas tissue-specific genes were highly expressed and had only medium-low coverage. We also predicted that genes with medium-low expression and high promoter coverage were actively repressed. Within this group, we extracted a protein-protein interaction network enriched for neuronal functions, likely preventing the cells from adopting a neuronal fate. We further confirmed that a repressive histone mark is bound to the promoters of genes in this network. Finally, we ran our pipeline using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data generated in ten additional cell types. We again found that genes with the strongest correlation are enriched for housekeeping functions and that genes with medium-low promoter coverage and high expression are more likely to be tissue-specific. These results demonstrate that only two data types, both of which require relatively low starting material to generate and are becoming more commonly available, can be integrated to understand multiple aspects of gene regulation. Conclusions: Within the placenta, we identified an active placenta-specific gene network as well as a repressed neuronal network. Beyond the placenta, we demonstrate that ATAC-seq data and RNA-seq data can be integrated to identify tissue-specific genes and actively repressed gene networks in multiple cell types. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - RNA cytosine-5 methylation (m 5 C) has emerged as a key epitranscriptomic mark, which fulfills multiple roles in structural modulation, stress signaling and the regulation of protein translation. Bisulfite sequencing is currently the most accurate and reliable method to detect m 5 C marks at nucleotide resolution. Targeted bisulfite sequencing allows m 5 C detection at single base resolution, by combining the use of tailored primers with bisulfite treatment. A number of computational tools currently exist to analyse m 5 C marks in DNA bisulfite sequencing. However, these methods are not directly applicable to the analysis of RNA m 5 C marks, because DNA analysis focuses on CpG methylation, and because artifactual unconversion and misamplification in RNA can obscure actual methylation signals. We describe a pipeline designed specifically for RNA cytosine-5 methylation analysis in targeted bisulfite sequencing experiments. The pipeline is directly applicable to Illumina MiSeq (or equivalent) sequencing datasets using a web interface (https://bisamp.dkfz.de), and is defined by optimized mapping parameters and the application of tailored filters for the removal of artifacts. We provide examples for the application of this pipeline in the unambiguous detection of m 5 C marks in tRNAs from mouse embryonic stem cells and neuron-differentiated stem cells as well as in 28S rRNA from human fibroblasts. Finally, we also discuss the adaptability of BisAMP to the analysis of DNA methylation. Our pipeline provides an accurate, fast and user-friendly framework for the analysis of cytosine-5 methylation in amplicons from bisulfite-treated RNA. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: Basic parameters commonly used to describe genomes including length, weight and relative guanine-cytosine (GC) content are widely cited in absence of a primary source. By using updated data and original software we determined these values to the best of our knowledge as standard reference for the whole human nuclear genome, for each chromosome and for mitochondrial DNA. We also devised a method to calculate the relative GC content in the whole messenger RNA sequence set and in transcriptomes by multiplying the GC content of each gene by its mean expression level. Results: The male nuclear diploid genome extends for 6.27 Gigabase pairs (Gbp), is 205.00 cm (cm) long and weighs 6.41 picograms (pg). Female values are 6.37 Gbp, 208.23 cm, 6.51 pg. The individual variability and the implication for the DNA informational density in terms of bits/volume were discussed. The genomic GC content is 40.9%. Following analysis in different transcriptomes and species, we showed that the greatest deviation was observed in the pathological condition analysed (trisomy 21 leukaemic cells) and in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results may represent a solid basis for further investigation on human structural and functional genomics while also providing a framework for other genome comparative analysis. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: The heart responds to hemodynamic overload through cardiac hypertrophy and activation of the fetal gene program. However, these changes have not been thoroughly examined in individual cardiomyocytes, and the relation between cardiomyocyte size and fetal gene expression remains elusive. We established a method of high-throughput single-molecule RNA imaging analysis of in vivo cardiomyocytes and determined spatial and temporal changes during the development of heart failure. Methods and results: We applied three novel single-cell analysis methods, namely, single-cell quantitative PCR (sc-qPCR), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). Isolated cardiomyocytes and cross sections from pressure overloaded murine hearts after transverse aortic constriction (TAC) were analyzed at an early hypertrophy stage (2 weeks, TAC2W) and at a late heart failure stage (8 weeks, TAC8W). Expression of myosin heavy chain β (Myh7), a representative fetal gene, was induced in some cardiomyocytes in TAC2W hearts and in more cardiomyocytes in TAC8W hearts. Expression levels of Myh7 varied considerably among cardiomyocytes. Myh7-expressing cardiomyocytes were significantly more abundant in the middle layer, compared with the inner or outer layers of TAC2W hearts, while such spatial differences were not observed in TAC8W hearts. Expression levels of Myh7 were inversely correlated with cardiomyocyte size and expression levels of mitochondria-related genes. Conclusions: We developed a new image-analysis pipeline to allow automated and unbiased quantification of gene expression at the single-cell level and determined the spatial and temporal regulation of heterogenous Myh7 expression in cardiomyocytes after pressure overload. © 2019 The Authors

N2  - The availability of low-cost small-factor sequencers, such as the Illumina MiSeq, MiniSeq, or iSeq, have paved the way for democratizing genomics sequencing, providing researchers in minority universities with access to the technology that was previously only affordable by institutions with large core facilities. However, these instruments are not bundled with software for performing bioinformatics data analysis, and the data analysis can be the main bottleneck for independent laboratories or even small clinical facilities that consider adopting genomic sequencing for medical applications. To address this issue, we have developed miCloud, a bioinformatics platform that enables genomic data analysis through a fully featured data analysis cloud, which seamlessly integrates with genome sequencers over the local network. The miCloud can be easily deployed without any prior bioinformatics expertise on any computing environment, from a laboratory computer workstation to a university computer cluster. Our platform not only provides access to a set of preconfigured RNA-Seq and CHIP-Seq bioinformatics pipelines, but also enables users to develop or install new preconfigured tools from the large selection available on open-source online Docker container repositories. The miCloud built-in analysis pipelines are also integrated with the Visual Omics Explorer framework (Kim et al., 2016), which provides rich interactive visualizations and publication-ready graphics from the next-generation sequencing data. Ultimately, the miCloud demonstrates a bioinformatics approach that can be adopted in the field for standardizing genomic data analysis, similarly to the way molecular biology sample preparation kits have standardized laboratory operations. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.

N2  - High-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies have led to a rapid increase in the number of sequence variants identified in clinical practice via diagnostic genetic tests. Current bioinformatic analysis pipelines fail to take adequate account of the possible splicing effects of such variants, particularly where variants fall outwith canonical splice site sequences, and consequently the pathogenicity of such variants may often be missed. The regulation of splicing is highly complex and as a result, in silico prediction tools lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for reliable use. Variants of all kinds can be linked to aberrant splicing in disease and the need for correct identification and diagnosis grows ever more crucial as novel splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide therapies start to enter clinical usage. RT-PCR provides a useful targeted assay of the splicing effects of identified variants, while minigene assays, massive parallel reporter assays and animal models can also be used for more detailed study of a particular splicing system, given enough time and resources. However, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has the potential to be used as a rapid diagnostic tool in genomic medicine. By utilising data science approaches and machine learning, it may prove possible to finally understand and interpret the 'splicing code’ and apply this knowledge in human disease diagnostics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq, currently dominate genome-wide gene expression studies. A standard approach to analyse this data requires mapping sequence reads to a reference and counting the number of reads which map to each gene. However, for many transcriptome studies, a suitable reference genome is unavailable, especially for meta-transcriptome studies which assay gene expression from mixed populations of organisms. Where a reference is unavailable, it is possible to generate a reference by the de novo assembly of the sequence reads. However, the high cost of generating high-coverage data for de novo assembly hinders this approach and more importantly the accurate assembly of such data is challenging, especially for meta-transcriptome data, and resulting assemblies frequently suffer from collapsed regions or chimeric sequences. As an alternative to the standard reference mapping approach, we have developed a k-mer-based analysis pipeline (DiffKAP) to identify differentially expressed reads between RNA-Seq datasets without the requirement for a reference. We compared the DiffKAP approach with the traditional Tophat/Cuffdiff method using RNA-Seq data from soybean, which has a suitable reference genome. We subsequently examined differential gene expression for a coral meta-transcriptome where no reference is available, and validated the results using qRT-PCR. We conclude that DiffKAP is an accurate method to study differential gene expression in complex meta-transcriptomes without the requirement of a reference genome. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background: Existing tools for the aggregation and visualization of differential expression data have discrete functionality and require that end-users rely on multiple software packages with complex dependencies or manually manipulate data for analysis and interpretation. Furthermore, at present, data aggregation and visualization are laborious, time consuming, and subject to human error. This is a serious limitation on the current state of differential transcriptomic analysis, which makes it necessary to expend extensive time and resources to reach the point where biological meaning can be interpreted. Such an approach for analysis also leads to scattered and non-standardized code, unsystematic project management and non-reproducible result sets. Results: Here, we present a differential expression analysis toolkit, DEvis, that provides a powerful, integrated solution for the analysis of differential expression data with a rapid turnaround time. DEvis has simple installation requirements and provides a convenient, user-friendly R package that addresses the issues inherent to complex multi-factor experiments, such as multiple contrast aggregation and integration, result sorting and selection, visualization, project management, and reproducibility. This tool increases the capabilities of differential expression analysis while reducing workload and the potential for manual error. Furthermore, it provides a much-needed encapsulation of scattered functionality, making large and complex analysis more efficient and reproducible. Conclusion: DEvis provides a wide range of powerful visualization, data aggregation, and project management tools that provide flexibility and speed in analysis. The functionality provided by DEVis increases efficiency of analysis and supplies researchers with new and relevant means for the analysis of large and complicated transcriptomic experiments. DEvis furthermore incorporates automatic project management capabilities, which standardizes analysis and ensures the reproducibility of results. After the establishment of statistical frameworks that identify differentially expressed genes, this package is the next logical step for differential transcriptomic analysis, establishing the critical framework necessary to manipulate, explore, and extract biologically relevant meaning from differential expression data. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: High-throughput sequencing often provides a foundation for experimental analyses in the life sciences. For many such methods, an intermediate layer of bioinformatics data analysis is the genomic signal track constructed by short read mapping to a particular genome assembly. There are many software tools to visualize genomic tracks in a web browser or with a stand-alone graphical user interface. However, there are only few command-line applications suitable for automated usage or production of publication-ready visualizations. Results: Here we present svist4get, a command-line tool for customizable generation of publication-quality figures based on data from genomic signal tracks. Similarly to generic genome browser software, svist4get visualizes signal tracks at a given genomic location and is able to aggregate data from several tracks on a single plot along with the transcriptome annotation. The resulting plots can be saved as the vector or high-resolution bitmap images. We demonstrate practical use cases of svist4get for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq data. Conclusions: svist4get is implemented in Python 3 and runs on Linux. The command-line interface of svist4get allows for easy integration into bioinformatics pipelines in a console environment. Extra customization is possible through configuration files and Python API. For convenience, svist4get is provided as pypi package.

N2  - Background: The use of microarrays and RNA-seq technologies is ubiquitous for transcriptome analyses in modern biology. With proper analysis tools, the differential gene expression analysis process can be significantly accelerated. Many open-source programs provide cutting-edge techniques, but these often require programming skills and lack intuitive and interactive or graphical user interfaces. To avoid bottlenecks impeding seamless analysis processing, we have developed an Interactive Gene Expression Analysis Kit, we term iGEAK, focusing on usability and interactivity. iGEAK is designed to be a simple, intuitive, light-weight that contrasts with heavy-duty programs. Results: iGEAK is an R/Shiny-based client-side desktop application, providing an interactive gene expression data analysis pipeline for microarray and RNA-seq data. Gene expression data can be intuitively explored using a seamless analysis pipeline consisting of sample selection, differentially expressed gene prediction, protein-protein interaction, and gene set enrichment analyses. For each analysis step, users can easily alter parameters to mine more relevant biological information. Conclusion: iGEAK is the outcome of close collaboration with wet-bench biologists who are eager to easily explore, mine, and analyze new or public microarray and RNA-seq data. We designed iGEAK as a gene expression analysis pipeline tool to provide essential analysis steps and a user-friendly interactive graphical user interface. iGEAK enables users without programing knowledge to comfortably perform differential gene expression predictions and downstream analyses. iGEAK packages, manuals, tutorials, sample datasets are available at the iGEAK project homepage (https://sites.google.com/view/iGEAK). © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: RNA-seq, wherein RNA transcripts expressed in a sample are sequenced and quantified, has become a widely used technique to study disease and development. With RNA-seq, transcription abundance can be measured, differential expression genes between groups and functional enrichment of those genes can be computed. However, biological insights from RNA-seq are often limited by computational analysis and the enormous volume of resulting data, preventing facile and meaningful review and interpretation of gene expression profiles. Particularly, in cases where the samples under study exhibit uncontrolled variation, deeper analysis of functional enrichment would be necessary to visualize samples' gene expression activity under each biological function. Results: We developed a Bioconductor package rgsepd that streamlines RNA-seq data analysis by wrapping commonly used tools DESeq2 and GOSeq in a user-friendly interface and performs a gene-subset linear projection to cluster heterogeneous samples by Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Rgsepd computes significantly enriched GO terms for each experimental condition and generates multidimensional projection plots highlighting how each predefined gene set's multidimensional expression may delineate samples. Conclusions: The rgsepd serves to automate differential expression, functional annotation, and exploratory data analyses to highlight subtle expression differences among samples based on each significant biological function. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Alternative splicing plays an important role in numerous cellular processes and aberrant splice decisions are associated with cancer. Although some studies point to a regulation of alternative splicing and its effector mechanisms in a time-dependent manner, the extent and consequences of such a regulation remains poorly understood. In the present work, we investigated the time-dependent production of isoforms in two Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines of different progression stages (HD-MY-Z, stage IIIb and L-1236, stage IV) compared to a B lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL-HO) with a focus on tumour necrosis factor (TNF) pathway-related elements. For this, we used newly generated time-course RNA-sequencing data from the mentioned cell lines and applied a computational pipeline to identify genes with isoform-switching behaviour in time. We analysed the temporal profiles of the identified events and evaluated in detail the potential functional implications of alterations in isoform expression for the selected top-switching genes. Our data indicate that elements within the TNF pathway undergo a time-dependent variation in isoform production with a putative impact on cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis. These include the genes TRAF1, TNFRSF12A and NFKB2. Our results point to a role of temporal alternative splicing in isoform production, which may alter the outcome of the TNF pathway and impact on tumorigenesis.

N2  - Objective: Differential expression (DE) is a fundamental step in the analysis of RNA-Seq count data. We had previously developed an R/Bioconductor package (called TCC) for this purpose. While this package has the unique feature of an in-built robust normalization method, its use has so far been limited to R users only. There is thus, a need for an alternative to DE analysis by TCC for non-R users. Results: Here, we present a graphical user interface for TCC (called TCC-GUI). Non-R users only need a web browser as the minimum requirement for its use (https://infinityloop.shinyapps.io/TCC-GUI/). TCC-GUI is implemented in R and encapsulated in Shiny application. It contains all the major functionalities of TCC, including DE pipelines with robust normalization and simulation data generation under various conditions. It also contains (i) tools for exploratory analysis, including a useful score termed average silhouette that measures the degree of separation of compared groups, (ii) visualization tools such as volcano plot and heatmap with hierarchical clustering, and (iii) a reporting tool using R Markdown. By virtue of the Shiny-based GUI framework, users can obtain results simply by mouse navigation. The source code for TCC-GUI is available at https://github.com/swsoyee/TCC-GUI under MIT license. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Transposable elements (TEs) are interspersed repeat sequences that make up much of the human genome. Their expression has been implicated in development and disease. However, TE-derived RNA-seq reads are difficult to quantify. Past approaches have excluded these reads or aggregated RNA expression to subfamilies shared by similar TE copies, sacrificing quantitative accuracy or the genomic context necessary to understand the basis of TE transcription. As a result, the effects of TEs on gene expression and associated phenotypes are not well understood. Here, we present Software for Quantifying Interspersed Repeat Expression (SQuIRE), the first RNA-seq analysis pipeline that provides a quantitative and locus-specific picture of TE expression (https://github.com/wyang17/SQuIRE). SQuIRE is an accurate and user-friendly tool that can be used for a variety of species. We applied SQuIRE to RNA-seq from normal mouse tissues and a Drosophila model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In both model organisms, we recapitulated previously reported TE subfamily expression levels and revealed locus-specific TE expression. We also identified differences in TE transcription patterns relating to transcript type, gene expression and RNA splicing that would be lost with other approaches using subfamily-level analyses. Altogether, our findings illustrate the importance of studying TE transcription with locus-level resolution. © The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - In the bone marrow, CXCL12 and IL-7 are essential for B cell differentiation, whereas hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance requires SCF and CXCL12. Peri-sinusoidal stromal (PSS) cells are the main source of IL-7, but their characterization as a pro-B cell niche remains limited. Here, we characterize pro-B cell supporting stromal cells and decipher the interaction network allowing pro-B cell retention. Preferential contacts are found between pro-B cells and PSS cells, which homogeneously express HSC and B cell niche genes. Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche. Using an interactome bioinformatics pipeline, we identify Nidogen-1 as essential for pro-B cell retention in the peri-sinusoidal niche as confirmed in Nidogen-1 −/− mice. Finally, human pro-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors are observed close to similar IL-7 + stromal cells. Thus, a multispecific niche exists in mouse and human supporting both early progenitors and committed hematopoietic lineages. © 2019 The Author(s)
Balzano et al. show that bone marrow peri-sinusoidal stromal cells, which form the hematopoietic stem cell niche, also express B cell niche genes including IL-7 and Nidogen-1. Loss of Nidogen-1 expression specifically affects access of pro-B cells to IL-7, resulting in impaired expansion and differentiation of early B cells. © 2019 The Author(s)

Use of these cells for in vivo cardiac regeneration and to generate human heart muscle bundles results in improved heart function. © 2019 The Author(s)
Regeneration of injured human heart muscle is limited and an unmet clinical need. There are no methods for the reproducible generation of clinical-quality stem cell-derived cardiovascular progenitors (CVPs). We identified laminin-221 (LN-221) as the most likely expressed cardiac laminin. We produced it as human recombinant protein and showed that LN-221 promotes differentiation of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) toward cardiomyocyte lineage and downregulates pluripotency and teratoma-associated genes. We developed a chemically defined, xeno-free laminin-based differentiation protocol to generate CVPs. We show high reproducibility of the differentiation protocol using time-course bulk RNA sequencing developed from different hESC lines. Single-cell RNA sequencing of CVPs derived from hESC lines supported reproducibility and identified three main progenitor subpopulations. These CVPs were transplanted into myocardial infarction mice, where heart function was measured by echocardiogram and human heart muscle bundle formation was identified histologically. This method may provide clinical-quality cells for use in regenerative cardiology. © 2019 The Author(s)

N2  - Over the last few years, RNA-seq has been used to study alterations in alternative splicing related to several diseases. Bioinformatics workflows used to perform these studies can be divided into two groups, those finding changes in the absolute isoform expression and those studying differential splicing. Many computational methods for transcriptomics analysis have been developed, evaluated and compared; however, there are not enough reports of systematic and objective assessment of processing pipelines as a whole. Moreover, comparative studies have been performed considering separately the changes in absolute or relative isoform expression levels. Consequently, no consensus exists about the best practices and appropriate workflows to analyse alternative and differential splicing. To assist the adequate pipeline choice, we present here a benchmarking of nine commonly used workflows to detect differential isoform expression and splicing. We evaluated the workflows performance over different experimental scenarios where changes in absolute and relative isoform expression occurred simultaneously. In addition, the effect of the number of isoforms per gene, and the magnitude of the expression change over pipeline performances were also evaluated. Our results suggest that workflow performance is influenced by the number of replicates per condition and the conditions heterogeneity. In general, workflows based on DESeq2, DEXSeq, Limma and NOISeq performed well over a wide range of transcriptomics experiments. In particular, we suggest the use of workflows based on Limma when high precision is required, and DESeq2 and DEXseq pipelines to prioritize sensitivity. When several replicates per condition are available, NOISeq and Limma pipelines are indicated. © 2017 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

N2  - RNA editing is a widespread co/posttranscriptional mechanism affecting primary RNAs by specific nucleotide modifications, which plays relevant roles in molecular processes including regulation of gene expression and/or the processing of noncoding RNAs. In recent years, the detection of editing sites has been improved through the availability of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technologies. Accurate bioinformatics pipelines are essential for the analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data to ensure the correct identification of edited sites. Several pipelines, using various read mappers and variant callers with a wide range of adjustable parameters, are available for the detection of RNA editing events. In this review, we discuss some of the most recent and popular tools and provide guidelines for RNA-Seq data generation and analysis for the detection of RNA editing in massive transcriptome data. Using simulated and real data sets, we provide an overview of their behavior, emphasizing the fact that the RNA editing detection in NGS data sets remains a challenging task. © 2017 The Author.

N2  - Background: RNA-Seq technology is routinely used to characterize the transcriptome, and to detect gene expression differences among cell types, genotypes and conditions. Advances in short-read sequencing instruments such as Illumina Next-Seq have yielded easy-to-operate machines, with high throughput, at a lower price per base. However, processing this data requires bioinformatics expertise to tailor and execute specific solutions for each type of library preparation. Results: In order to enable fast and user-friendly data analysis, we developed an intuitive and scalable transcriptome pipeline that executes the full process, starting from cDNA sequences derived by RNA-Seq [Nat Rev Genet 10:57-63, 2009] and bulk MARS-Seq [Science 343:776-779, 2014] and ending with sets of differentially expressed genes. Output files are placed in structured folders, and results summaries are provided in rich and comprehensive reports, containing dozens of plots, tables and links. Conclusion: Our User-friendly Transcriptome Analysis Pipeline (UTAP) is an open source, web-based intuitive platform available to the biomedical research community, enabling researchers to efficiently and accurately analyse transcriptome sequence data. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - We introduce alevin, a fast end-to-end pipeline to process droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing data, performing cell barcode detection, read mapping, unique molecular identifier (UMI) deduplication, gene count estimation, and cell barcode whitelisting. Alevin's approach to UMI deduplication considers transcript-level constraints on the molecules from which UMIs may have arisen and accounts for both gene-unique reads and reads that multimap between genes. This addresses the inherent bias in existing tools which discard gene-ambiguous reads and improves the accuracy of gene abundance estimates. Alevin is considerably faster, typically eight times, than existing gene quantification approaches, while also using less memory. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Marek's disease virus (MDV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus that can cause T-cell lymphomas in chicken. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is strongly associated with various cancers and many other diseases. In chickens, lncRNAs have not been comprehensively identified. Here, we profiled mRNA and lncRNA repertoires in three groups of spleens from MDV-infected and non-infected chickens, including seven tumorous spleens (TS) from MDV-infected chickens, five spleens from the survivors (SS) without lesions after MDV infection, and five spleens from noninfected chickens (NS), to explore the underlying mechanism of host resistance in Marek's disease (MD). Results: By using a precise lncRNA identification pipeline, we identified 1315 putative lncRNAs and 1166 known lncRNAs in spleen tissue. Genomic features of putative lncRNAs were characterized. Differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, putative lncRNAs, and known lncRNAs were profiled among three groups. We found that several specific intergroup differentially expressed genes were involved in important biological processes and pathways, including B cell activation and the Wnt signaling pathway; some of these genes were also found to be the hub genes in the co-expression network analyzed by WGCNA. Network analysis depicted both intergenic correlation and correlation between genes and MD traits. Five DE lncRNAs including MSTRG.360.1, MSTRG.6725.1, MSTRG.6754.1, MSTRG.15539.1, and MSTRG.7747.5 strongly correlated with MD-resistant candidate genes, such as IGF-I, CTLA4, HDAC9, SWAP70, CD72, JCHAIN, CXCL12, and CD8B, suggesting that lncRNAs may affect MD resistance and tumorigenesis in chicken spleens through their target genes. Conclusions: Our results provide both transcriptomic and epigenetic insights on MD resistance and its pathological mechanism. The comprehensive lncRNA and mRNA transcriptomes in MDV-infected chicken spleens were profiled. Co-expression analysis identified integrated lncRNA-mRNA and gene-gene interaction networks, implying that hub genes or lncRNAs exert critical influence on MD resistance and tumorigenesis. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: The last 10 years have seen the rise of countless functional genomics studies based on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). In the vast majority of cases, whatever the species, whatever the experiment, the two first steps of data analysis consist of a quality control of the raw reads followed by a mapping of those reads to a reference genome/transcriptome. Subsequent steps then depend on the type of study that is being made. While some tools have been proposed for investigating data quality after the mapping step, there is no commonly adopted framework that would be easy to use and broadly applicable to any NGS data type. Results: We present ALFA, a simple but universal tool that can be used after the mapping step on any kind of NGS experiment data for any organism with available genomic annotations. In a single command line, ALFA can compute and display distribution of reads by categories (exon, intron, UTR, etc.) and biotypes (protein coding, miRNA, etc.) for a given aligned dataset with nucleotide precision. We present applications of ALFA to Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq on Homo sapiens, CLIP-Seq on Mus musculus, RNA-Seq on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bisulfite sequencing on Arabidopsis thaliana and ChIP-Seq on Caenorhabditis elegans. Conclusions: We show that ALFA provides a powerful and broadly applicable approach for post mapping quality control and to produce a global overview using common or dedicated annotations. It is made available to the community as an easy to install command line tool and from the Galaxy Tool Shed. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Rapid advances in genomic technologies have facilitated the identification pathogenic variants causing human disease. We report siblings with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy due to a novel, shared heterozygous pathogenic 13 bp duplication in SYNGAP1 (c.435_447dup, p.(L150Vfs*6)) that was identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS). The pathogenic variant had escaped earlier detection via two methodologies: whole exome sequencing and high-depth targeted sequencing. Both technologies had produced reads carrying the variant, however, they were either not aligned due to the size of the insertion or aligned to multiple major histocompatibility complex (MHC) regions in the hg19 reference genome, making the critical reads unavailable for variant calling. The WGS pipeline followed different protocols, including alignment of reads to the GRCh37 reference genome, which lacks the additional MHC contigs. Our findings highlight the benefit of using orthogonal clinical bioinformatic pipelines and all relevant inheritance patterns to re-analyze genomic data in undiagnosed patients. © 2018 The Authors.

N2  - Background: As an important biomass raw material, the lignocellulose in bamboo is of significant value in energy conversion. The conversion of bamboo lignocellulose into fermentable reducing sugar, i.e. the degradation of bamboo lignocellulose, is an important step in lignocellulose conversion. However, little research has focussed on excavating the enzymes and microbes that are related to the degradation of bamboo lignocellulose, which is important for its utilisation. This study used Cyrtotrachelus buqueti (bamboo snout beetle) to evaluate the efficiency of bamboo lignocellulose degradation. Results: RNA sequencing was conducted to sequence the transcriptome of the insect before and after feeding on bamboo shoots. The expression levels of genes encoding several carbohydrate-active enzymes, such as endoglucanase (evgtrinloc27093t1 and evgtrinloc16407t0) and laccase (evgtrinloc15173t0 and evgtrinloc11252t0), were found to be upregulated after feeding. Faecal component analysis showed that the degradation efficiencies of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were 61.82%, 87.65% and 69.05%, respectively. After 6 days of co-culture with crude enzymes in vitro, the degradation efficiencies of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in bamboo shoot particles (BSPs) were 24.98%, 37.52% and 26.67%, respectively. These results indicated that lignocellulosic enzymes and related enzymes within the insect itself co-degraded bamboo lignocellulose. These finding can potentially be used for the pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of bamboo lignocellulose. Conclusion: Our results showed that intestinal digestive enzymes from C. buqueti degraded bamboo shoot lignocellulose both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the expression levels of many carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes were upregulated in the transcriptome, including those for cellulase, xylanase and ligninase genes. Therefore, we proposed a scheme for applying the lignocellulolytic enzymes from C. buqueti to degrade bamboo lignocellulose using genetic, enzymatic and fermentation engineering techniques to overexpress the lignocellulolytic enzymes genes in vitro and obtain large quantities of enzymes that could efficiently degrade bamboo lignocellulose and be used for lignocellulose bioconversion. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Aim: The methylome associated with miRNA loci was investigated in oral cancer to explore tobacco specific methylation and potential biomarkers for patient survival. Methods: Methylome data was generated from 16 pairs of cancer-normal tissues by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing method. Differentially methylated regions were identified using the DMAP pipeline. In silico validation and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed on The Cancer Genome Atlas data based on our miRNA methylome data. Results: A total of 4310 unique differentially methylated regions, mapping to 144 miRNA loci, were identified. Three distinct groups of miRNAs were differentially methylated in cancer tissues from smokers, chewers and mixed habitués. Hypermethylation of miR-503, miR-200a/b, miR-320b and miR-489 was associated with worse 5-year survival. Conclusion: Differential methylation patterns in miRNA loci are associated with poor survival underscoring their potential as predictive and prognostic biomarkers in oral cancer. © 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - A mechanistic understanding of evolutionary developmental biology requires the development of novel techniques for the manipulation of gene function in phylogenetically diverse organismal systems. Recently, gene-specific knockdown by microinjection of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was applied in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, demonstrating that the shRNA approach can be used for efficient and robust sequence-specific knockdown of a gene of interest. However, the time- and labor-intensive process of microinjection limits access to this technique and its application in large scale experiments. To address this issue, here we present an electroporation protocol for shRNA delivery into Nematostella eggs. This method leverages the speed and simplicity of electroporation, enabling users to manipulate gene expression in hundreds of eggs or embryos within minutes. We provide a detailed description of the experimental procedure, including reagents, electroporation conditions, preparation of Nematostella eggs, and follow-up care of experimental animals. Finally, we demonstrate the knockdown of several endogenous and exogenous genes with known phenotypes and discuss the potential applications of this method. © 2019 The Authors

N2  - Dioecy has evolved recently and independently from cosexual populations in many angiosperm lineages, providing opportunities to understand the evolutionary process underlying this transition. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is a dioecious plant with homomorphic sex chromosomes (XY). Although most of the spinach Y chromosome recombines with the X chromosome, a region around the male-determining locus on Y does not recombine with its X counterpart, suggesting that this region might be related to the evolution of dioecy in the species. To identify genes located in the non-recombining region (MSY, male-specific region of Y), RNA-seq analysis of male and female progeny plants (eight each) from a sib-cross of a dioecious line was performed. We discovered only 354 sex-chromosomal SNPs in 219 transcript sequences (genes). We randomly selected 39 sex-chromosomal genes to examine the reproducibility of the RNA-seq results and observed tight linkage to the male-determining locus in a spinach segregating population (140 individuals). Further analysis using a large-scale population (>1400) and over 100 spinach germplasm accessions and cultivars showed that SNPs in at least 12 genes are fully linked to the male-determining locus, suggesting that the genes reside in the spinach MSY. Synonymous substitution rates of the MSY genes and X homologues predict a recent divergence (0.40 ± 0.08 Mya). Furthermore, synonymous divergence between spinach and its wild relative (S. tetrandra), whose sex chromosomes (XY) originated from a common ancestral chromosome, predicted that the species diverged around 5.7 Mya. Assuming that dioecy in Spinacia evolved before speciation within the genus and has a monophyletic origin, our data suggest that recombination around the spinach sex-determining locus might have stopped significantly later than the evolution of dioecy in Spinacia. © 2019 Okazaki et al.

N2  - Blood-based diagnostics tests, using individual or panels of biomarkers, may revolutionize disease diagnostics and enable minimally invasive therapy monitoring. However, selection of the most relevant biomarkers from liquid biosources remains an immense challenge. We recently presented the thromboSeq pipeline, which enables RNA sequencing and cancer classification via self-learning and swarm intelligence–enhanced bioinformatics algorithms using blood platelet RNA. Here, we provide the wet-lab protocol for the generation of platelet RNA-sequencing libraries and the dry-lab protocol for the development of swarm intelligence–enhanced machine-learning-based classification algorithms. The wet-lab protocol includes platelet RNA isolation, mRNA amplification, and preparation for next-generation sequencing. The dry-lab protocol describes the automated FASTQ file pre-processing to quantified gene counts, quality controls, data normalization and correction, and swarm intelligence–enhanced support vector machine (SVM) algorithm development. This protocol enables platelet RNA profiling from 500 pg of platelet RNA and allows automated and optimized biomarker panel selection. The wet-lab protocol can be performed in 5 d before sequencing, and the algorithm development can be completed in 2 d, depending on computational resources. The protocol requires basic molecular biology skills and a basic understanding of Linux and R. In all, with this protocol, we aim to enable the scientific community to test platelet RNA for diagnostic algorithm development. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

N2  - Background: RNA sequencing is a widely used technology for differential expression analysis. However, the RNA-Seq do not provide accurate absolute measurements and the results can be different for each pipeline used. The major problem in statistical analysis of RNA-Seq and in the omics data in general, is the small sample size with respect to the large number of variables. In addition, experimental design must be taken into account and few tools consider it. Results: We propose OMICfpp, a method for the statistical analysis of RNA-Seq paired design data. First, we obtain a p-value for each case-control pair using a binomial test. These p-values are aggregated using an ordered weighted average (OWA) with a given orness previously chosen. The aggregated p-value from the original data is compared with the aggregated p-value obtained using the same method applied to random pairs. These new pairs are generated using between-pairs and complete randomization distributions. This randomization p-value is used as a raw p-value to test the differential expression of each gene. The OMICfpp method is evaluated using public data sets of 68 sample pairs from patients with colorectal cancer. We validate our results through bibliographic search of the reported genes and using simulated data set. Furthermore, we compared our results with those obtained by the methods edgeR and DESeq2 for paired samples. Finally, we propose new target genes to validate these as gene expression signatures in colorectal cancer. OMICfpp is available at http://www.uv.es/ayala/software/OMICfpp-0.2.tar.gz. Conclusions: Our study shows that OMICfpp is an accurate method for differential expression analysis in RNA-Seq data with paired design. In addition, we propose the use of randomized p-values pattern graphic as a powerful and robust method to select the target genes for experimental validation. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Breast tumors are inherently heterogeneous, but the evolving cellular organization through neoplastic progression is poorly understood. Here we report a rapid, large-scale single-cell resolution 3D imaging protocol based on a one-step clearing agent that allows visualization of normal tissue architecture and entire tumors at cellular resolution. Imaging of multicolor lineage-tracing models of breast cancer targeted to either basal or luminal progenitor cells revealed profound clonal restriction during progression. Expression profiling of clones arising in Pten/Trp53-deficient tumors identified distinct molecular signatures. Strikingly, most clones harbored cells that had undergone an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, indicating widespread, inherent plasticity. Hence, an integrative pipeline that combines lineage tracing, 3D imaging, and clonal RNA sequencing technologies offers a comprehensive path for studying mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in whole tumors. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is an indispensable tool in the study of gene regulation. While the technology has brought with it better transcript coverage and quantification, there remain considerable barriers to entry for the computational biologist to analyse large data sets. There is a real need for a repository of uniformly processed RNA-seq data that is easy to use. Findings: To address these obstacles, we developed Digital Expression Explorer 2 (DEE2), a web-based repository of RNA-seq data in the form of gene-level and transcript-level expression counts. DEE2 contains >5.3 trillion assigned reads from 580,000 RNA-seq data sets including species Escherichia coli, yeast, Arabidopsis, worm, fruit fly, zebrafish, rat, mouse, and human. Base-space sequence data downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive underwent quality control prior to transcriptome and genome mapping using open-source tools. Uniform data processing methods ensure consistency across experiments, facilitating fast and reproducible meta-analyses. Conclusions: The web interface allows users to quickly identify data sets of interest using accession number and keyword searches. The data can also be accessed programmatically using a specifically designed R package. We demonstrate that DEE2 data are compatible with statistical packages such as edgeR or DESeq. Bulk data are also available for download. DEE2 can be found at http://dee2.io. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

N2  - The brain as an important organ can be affected largely by aging, and the comprehensive transcriptional underpinnings of brain aging remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a high throughput RNA sequencing to evaluate the expression profiles of messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), micro RNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in porcine brain. We have identified 714 mRNAs, 38lncRNAs, 41miRNAs, and 148circRNAs were age-related genes in the porcine cerebral cortex. The lncRNAs, miRNAs and circRNAs have effect on the age of porcine brain due to the much changes of expression level as noncoding RNAs. The up-regulated genes were significantly enriched for stress response, reproductive regulatory process, immune response and metabolic process, and the down-regulated genes were related to neurologic function, stress response and signaling pathway. The synaptic transmission pathway may be the key role in aging of porcine brain that it was co-enriched for in both differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs. Moreover, some lncRNAs and their target genes were also differentially expressed during brain aging. We further assessed the multi-group cooperative control relationships and constructed circRNA-miRNA co-expression networks during brain aging. We also selected 2 mRNAs, 2 lncRNAs, 2 miRNAs, and 1 circRNAs to perform the q-PCR, and the expression patterns were highly consistent between the two methods confirming the high reproducibility and reliability of the gene expression profiling in our study. In conclusion, our findings will contribute to understand the transcriptional underpinnings of brain aging and provide a foundation for future studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying brain aging. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Assessment of Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) for response stratification of cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors is emerging as a new biomarker. Commonly defined as the total number of exonic somatic mutations, TMB approximates the amount of neoantigens that potentially are recognized by the immune system. While whole exome sequencing (WES) is an unbiased approach to quantify TMB, implementation in diagnostics is hampered by tissue availability as well as time and cost constrains. Conversely, panel-based targeted sequencing is nowadays widely used in routine molecular diagnostics, but only very limited data are available on its performance for TMB estimation. Here, we evaluated three commercially available larger gene panels with covered genomic regions of 0.39 Megabase pairs (Mbp), 0.53 Mbp and 1.7 Mbp using i) in silico analysis of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data and ii) wet-lab sequencing of a total of 92 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cancer samples grouped in three independent cohorts (non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC; colorectal cancer, CRC; and mixed cancer types) for which matching WES data were available. We observed a strong correlation of the panel data with WES mutation counts especially for the gene panel >1Mbp. Sensitivity and specificity related to TMB cutpoints for checkpoint inhibitor response in NSCLC determined by wet-lab experiments well reflected the in silico data. Additionally, we highlight potential pitfalls in bioinformatics pipelines and provide recommendations for variant filtering. In summary, our study is a valuable data source for researchers working in the field of immuno-oncology as well as for diagnostic laboratories planning TMB testing. © 2018 UICC

N2  - To achieve large-scale, high-throughput experiments for systems biology research of microorganisms, reliable data from robust cultivation systems are needed. Chemostats are such systems, ensuring reproducibility and quality by providing a stable, well-controlled environment for the cells. However, many of the available chemostat systems require large amounts of media and are complex to set up and expensive to purchase and maintain. To address these concerns, we developed a mini-chemostat (MC) system with 16 reactors, each at a working volume of 40 ml. Sensors measure dissolved oxygen in the reactor, while OD600 is measured in the outflow. We further developed a CO 2 and pH sensor array that can be plugged into the outflow of the reactors. The system was used to characterize yeast physiology at four metabolically different conditions: limitations of glucose, both aerobic and anaerobic, nitrogen, and ethanol. The physiology of yeast cells grown at the four different conditions in the MC system was compared with the yeast cells grown in a DASGIP 1 L system using RNAseq analysis. The results show that the MC system provides the same environmental conditions as the DASGIP system and that the MC system is reproducible between different runs. The system is built to be easily scalable with more reactors and to include more sensors, if available. Our study shows that a robust, reproducible chemostat system for high-throughput and large-scale experiments can be built at low costs. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a recent addition to the expanding universe of RNA species and originate through back-splicing events from linear primary transcripts. CircRNAs show specific expression profiles with regards to cell type and developmental stage. Importantly, only few circRNAs have been functionally characterized to date. The detection of circRNAs from RNA sequencing data is a complex computational workflow that, depending on tissue and condition typically yields candidate sets of hundreds or thousands of circRNA candidates. Here, we provide an overview on different computational analysis tools and pipelines that became available throughout the last years. We outline technical and experimental requirements that are common to all approaches and point out potential pitfalls during the computational analysis. Although computational prediction of circRNAs has become quite mature in recent years, we provide a set of valuable validation strategies, in silico as well as in vitro-based approaches. In addition to circRNA detection via back-splicing junction, we present available analysis pipelines for delineating the primary sequence and for predicting possible functions of circRNAs. Finally, we outline the most important web resources for circRNA research.

N2  - DNA methylation is a crucial regulator of gene transcription in the etiology and pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, it is reasonable to identify DNA methylation-related prognostic markers. Currently, we aimed to make an integrative epigenetic analysis of HCC to identify the effectiveness of epigenetic drivers in predicting prognosis for HCC patients. By the software pipeline TCGA-Assembler 2, RNA-seq, and methylation data were downloaded and processed from The Cancer Genome Atlas. A bioconductor package MethylMix was utilized to incorporate gene expression and methylation data on all 363 samples and identify 589 epigenetic drivers with transcriptionally predictive. By univariate survival analysis, 72 epigenetic drivers correlated with overall survival (OS) were selected for further analysis in our training cohort. By the robust likelihood-based survival model, six epi-drivers (doublecortin domain containing 2, flavin containing monooxygenase 3, G protein-coupled receptor 171, Lck interacting transmembrane adaptor 1, S100 calcium binding protein P, small nucleolar RNA host gene 6) serving as prognostic markers was identified and then a DNA methylation signature for HCC (MSH) predicting OS was identified to stratify patients into low-risk and high-risk groups in the training cohort (p < 0.001). The capability of MSH was also assessed in the validation cohort (p = 0.002). Furthermore, a receiver operating characteristic curve confirmed MSH as an effective prognostic model for predicting OS in HCC patients in training area under curve (AUC = 0.802) and validation (AUC = 0.691) cohorts. Finally, a nomogram comprising MSH and pathologic stage was generated to predict OS in the training cohort, and it also operated effectively in the validation cohort (concordance index: 0.674). In conclusion, MSH, a six epi-drivers based signature, is a potential model to predict prognosis for HCC patients. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Edwardsiella tarda belongs to the genera of Gram negative bacterium mainly associated with edwardsiellosis, the most commonly found infectious fish disease throughout the globe. E. tarda is also a widespread pathogen which cause infections such as cellulitis or gas gangrene and generalized infections in humans. To control the escalating infection of E. trada on various species, it is essential to decoded the mysterious mechanism behind the bacterial infection at transcript level. In this present study, we carry out a de novo E. tarda Whole transcriptome sequencing, isolated from infected fish intestine using SOLiD sequencing platform. RNA-Seq data analysis was performed using various bioinformatics pipelines. Protein-protein interaction study for pathway enrichment and gene ontology study were executed for further investigation. Assembly statistics for E. tarda dataset showed that the number of transcript contigs was 9657 out of which 6749 were GO annotated whereas 1528 were not assigned any GO terms. GO analysis showed that the expressed genes were enhanced with molecular function, cellular component and biological process. A KEGG enrichment study showed that pathway's that are directly linked with immune diseases like Rheumatoid arthritis (0.2%), Tuberculosis (0.3%) Endocytosis (0.6%) was considerably enriched. Protein-protein interaction study showed that most of the expressed proteins were involved in metabolic pathways, flagellar assembly, Propanoate metabolism, Microbial metabolism in diverse environments, Butanoate metabolism and Carbon. The present study provides novel E. tarda transcriptome sequence data, allowing us to identify biologically significant genes and their functional relationship with fish diseases, and will be useful in recognize the reliable therapeutic targets in near feature. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Extensive use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for pathogen profiling has the potential to transform our understanding of how genomic plasticity contributes to phenotypic versatility. However, the storage of large amounts of NGS data and visualization tools need to evolve to offer the scientific community fast and convenient access to these data. We introduce BACTOME as a database system that links aligned DNA- and RNA-sequencing reads of clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates with clinically relevant pathogen phenotypes. The database allows data extraction for any single isolate, gene or phenotype as well as data filtering and phenotypic grouping for specific research questions. With the integration of statistical tools we illustrate the usefulness of a relational database structure for the identification of phenotype-genotype correlations as an essential part of the discovery pipeline in genomic research. Furthermore, the database provides a compilation of DNA sequences and gene expression values of a plethora of clinical isolates to give a consensus DNA sequence and consensus gene expression signature. Deviations from the consensus thereby describe the genomic landscape and the transcriptional plasticity of the species P. aeruginosa. The database is available at https://bactome.helmholtz-hzi.de.

N2  - Background: RNA-seq is the most commonly used sequencing application. Not only does it measure gene expression but it is also an excellent media to detect important structural variants such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion (Indels) or fusion transcripts. However, detection of these variants is challenging and complex from RNA-seq. Here we describe a sensitive and accurate analytical pipeline which detects various mutations at once for translational precision medicine. Methods: The pipeline incorporates most sensitive aligners for Indels in RNA-Seq, the best practice for data preprocessing and variant calling, and STAR-fusion is for chimeric transcripts. Variants/mutations are annotated, and key genes can be extracted for further investigation and clinical actions. Three datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the pipeline for SNVs, indels and fusion transcripts. Results: For the well-defined variants from NA12878 by GIAB project, about 95% and 80% of sensitivities were obtained for SNVs and indels, respectively, in matching RNA-seq. Comparison with other variant specific tools showed good performance of the pipeline. For the lung cancer dataset with 41 known and oncogenic mutations, 39 were detected by the pipeline with STAR aligner and all by the GSNAP aligner. An actionable EML4 and ALK fusion was also detected in one of the tumors, which also demonstrated outlier ALK expression. For 9 fusions spiked-into RNA-seq libraries with different concentrations, the pipeline was able to detect all in unfiltered results although some at very low concentrations may be missed when filtering was applied. Conclusions: The new RNA-seq workflow is an accurate and comprehensive mutation profiler from RNA-seq. Key or actionable mutations are reliably detected from RNA-seq, which makes it a practical alternative source for personalized medicine.

N2  - Background: The plastid acquisition by secondary endosymbiosis is a driving force for the algal evolution, and the comparative genomics was required to examine the genomic change of symbiont. Therefore, we established a pipeline of a de novo assembly of middle-sized genomes at a low cost and with high quality using long and short reads. Results: We sequenced symbiotic algae Chlorella variabilis using Oxfofrd Nanopore MinION as the long-read sequencer and Illumina HiSeq 4000 as the short-read sequencer and then assembled the genomes under various conditions. Subsequently, we evaluated these assemblies by the gene model quality and RNA-seq mapping rate. We found that long-read only assembly could not be suitable for the comparative genomics studies, but with short reads, we could obtain the acceptable assembly. On the basis of this result, we established the pipeline of de novo assembly for middle-sized algal genome using MinION. Conclusions: The genomic change during the early stages of plastid acquisition can now be revealed by sequencing and comparing many algal genomes. Moreover, this pipeline offers a solution for the assembly of various middle-sized eukaryotic genomes with high-quality and ease.

N2  - Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is an X-linked rare dominant disorder of autophagy. The role of WDR45 has been implicated in BPAN almost exclusively in females possibly due to male lethality. Characterization of distinctive clinical manifestations and potentially the complex genetic determinants in rare male patients remain crucial for deciphering BPAN and other X-linked dominant diseases. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) followed by segregation analysis and identified a novel nonsense and mosaic variant in WDR45, namely NM_007075.3:c.873C>G; p.(Tyr291*) in an affected male at the age of 34. His biphasic medical history was compatible with BPAN, which was characterized by delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, and progression into dystonia parkinsonism in his twenties. The variant had an apparently mosaic pattern both in whole exome and Sanger sequencing findings. In order to figure out if mosaicism was restricted to this variant or related to a chromosomal level mosaicism, we used our in-house WES data from 129 unrelated individuals to calculate the threshold values of male and female X chromosome heterozygosity (XcHet) in WES data for our pipeline. A background level of heterozygous variants on X chromosome excluding the pseudoautosomal loci is an observed phenomenon in WES analysis and this level has been used as a quality measure. Herein, we suggest utilization of this measure for detection of digital anomalies of the X chromosome in males by potentially observing a higher XcHet value than the threshold value. This approach has revealed a variant level mosaicism in the affected male, which was further supported with cytogenetic analyses.

N2  - Background3' RNA sequencing provides an alternative to whole transcript analysis. However, we do not know a priori the relative advantage of each method. Thus, a comprehensive comparison between the whole transcript and the 3 method is needed to determine their relative merits. To this end, we used two commercially available library preparation kits, the KAPA Stranded mRNA-Seq kit (traditional method) and the Lexogen QuantSeq 3' mRNA-Seq kit (3 method), to prepare libraries from mouse liver RNA. We then sequenced and analyzed the libraries to determine the advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches.ResultsWe found that the traditional whole transcript method and the 3' RNA-Seq method had similar levels of reproducibility. As expected, the whole transcript method assigned more reads to longer transcripts, while the 3 method assigned roughly equal numbers of reads to transcripts regardless of their lengths. We found that the 3' RNA-Seq method detected more short transcripts than the whole transcript method. With regard to differential expression analysis, we found that the whole transcript method detected more differentially expressed genes, regardless of the level of sequencing depth.ConclusionsThe 3' RNA-Seq method was better able to detect short transcripts, while the whole transcript RNA-Seq was able to detect more differentially expressed genes. Thus, both approaches have relative advantages and should be selected based on the goals of the experiment.

N2  - Loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta is widely distributed in the oceans of tropical and subtropical latitude. This turtle is an endangered species due to anthropic and natural factors that have decreased their population levels. In this study, RNA sequencing and de-novo assembly of genes expressed in blood were performed. The raw FASTQ files have been deposited on NCBI's SRA database with accession number SRX2629512. A total of 5.4 Gb raw sequence data were obtained, corresponding to 48,257,019 raw reads. Trinity pipeline was used to perform a de-novo assembly, we were able to identify 64,930 transcripts for female loggerhead turtle transcriptome with an N50 of 1131 bp. The obtained transcriptome data will be useful for further studies of the physiology, biochemistry and evolution in this species.

N2  - BackgroudPopulus nigra is a major tree species of ecological and economic importance for which several initiatives have been set up to create genomic resources. In order to access the large number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) typically needed to carry out a genome scan, the present study aimed at evaluating RNA sequencing as a tool to discover and type SNPs in genes within natural populations of P. nigra.ResultsWe have devised a bioinformatics pipeline to call and type SNPs from RNAseq reads and applied it to P. nigra transcriptomic data. The accuracy of the resulting RNAseq-based SNP calling and typing has been evaluated by (i) comparing their position and alleles to those previously reported in candidate genes, (ii) assessing their genotyping accuracy with respect to a previously available SNP chip and (iii) evaluating their inter-annual repeatability. We found that a combination of several callers yields a good compromise between the number of variants type and the accuracy of genotyping. We further used the resulting genotypic data to carry out basic genetic analyses whose results confirm the quality of the RNAseq-based SNP dataset.ConclusionsWe demonstrated the potential and accuracy of RNAseq as an efficient way to genotype SNPs in P. nigra. These results open prospects towards the use of this technology for quantitative and population genomics studies.

N2  - Most of the research studies developed applying microarray technology to the characterization of different pathological states of any disease may fail in reaching statistically significant results. This is largely due to the small repertoire of analysed samples, and to the limitation in the number of states or pathologies usually addressed. Moreover, the influence of potential deviations on the gene expression quantification is usually disregarded. In spite of the continuous changes in omic sciences, reflected for instance in the emergence of new Next-Generation Sequencing-related technologies, the existing availability of a vast amount of gene expression microarray datasets should be properly exploited. Therefore, this work proposes a novel methodological approach involving the integration of several heterogeneous skin cancer series, and a later multiclass classifier design. This approach is thus a way to provide the clinicians with an intelligent diagnosis support tool based on the use of a robust set of selected biomarkers, which simultaneously distinguishes among different cancerrelated skin states. To achieve this, a multi-platform combination of microarray datasets from Affymetrix and Illumina manufacturers was carried out. This integration is expected to strengthen the statistical robustness of the study as well as the finding of highly-reliable skin cancer biomarkers. Specifically, the designed operation pipeline has allowed the identification of a small subset of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from which to distinguish among 7 involved skin states. These genes were obtained from the assessment of a number of potential batch effects on the gene expression data. The biological interpretation of these genes was inspected in the specific literature to understand their underlying information in relation to skin cancer. Finally, in order to assess their possible effectiveness in cancer diagnosis, a cross-validation Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based classification including feature ranking was performed. The accuracy attained exceeded the 92% in overall recognition of the 7 different cancer-related skin states. The proposed integration scheme is expected to allow the co-integration with other state-of-the-art technologies such as RNA-seq.

N2  - Nowadays, the analysis of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data has become the standard method for quantifying the levels of gene expression. In RNA-seq experiments, the mapping of short reads to a reference genome or transcriptome is considered a crucial step that remains as one of the most time-consuming. With the steady development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, unprecedented amounts of genomic data introduce significant challenges in terms of storage, processing and downstream analysis. As cost and throughput continue to improve, there is a growing need for new software solutions that minimize the impact of increasing data volume on RNA read alignment. In this work we introduce HSRA, a Big Data tool that takes advantage of the MapReduce programming model to extend the multithreading capabilities of a state-of-the-art spliced read aligner for RNA-seq data (HISAT2) to distributed memory systems such as multi-core clusters or cloud platforms. HSRA has been built upon the Hadoop MapReduce framework and supports both single- and paired-end reads from FASTQ/FASTA datasets, providing output alignments in SAM format. The design of HSRA has been carefully optimized to avoid the main limitations and major causes of inefficiency found in previous Big Data mapping tools, which cannot fully exploit the raw performance of the underlying aligner. On a 16-node multi-core cluster, HSRA is on average 2.3 times faster than previous Hadoop-based tools. Source code in Java as well as a user's guide are publicly available for download at http://hsra.dec.udc.es.

N2  - The development of High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) for RNA profiling (RNA-seq) has shed light on the diversity of transcriptomes. While RNA-seq is becoming a de facto standard for monitoring the population of expressed transcripts in a given condition at a specific time, processing the huge amount of data it generates requires dedicated bioinformatics programs. Here, we describe a standard bioinformatics protocol using state-of-the-art tools, the STAR mapper to align reads onto a reference genome, Cufflinks to reconstruct the transcriptome, and RSEM to quantify expression levels of genes and transcripts. We present the workflow using human transcriptome sequencing data from two biological replicates of the K562 cell line produced as part of the ENCODE3 project.

N2  - Background: Many bioinformatics pipelines are available nowadays to analyze transcriptomics data produced by high-throughput RNA sequencing. They implement different workflows that address several analysis tasks, supported by the use of third party programs. Nevertheless, a proper workflow definition for RNA-seq data analysis is still lacking. Objective: To proper define what a comprehensive RNA-seq data analysis workflow should be. Compare all available pipelines and, if such a solution is not available, implement a new pipeline. Method: We have developed a new pipeline integrating state-of-the art programs for different parts of the RNA-seq analysis. We also have used RUbioSeq libraries to achieve a scalable solution. Results: We have defined a comprehensive RNA-seq data analysis workflow, comprising the most common needs demanded by biologists and implemented it in a new pipeline, nextpresso. We also validate it in two case studies presented here. Conclusion: Nexpresso is a new, freely available, pipeline covering the most common needs of RNA-seq data analysis. It is easy to configure, generates user friendly results and scales well for larger studies comprising a high number of samples.

N2  - The advances in genomic sequencing during the past few years have motivated the development of fast and reliable software for DNA/RNA sequencing on current high performance architectures. Most of these efforts target multicore processors, only a few can also exploit graphics processing units, and a much smaller set will run in clusters equipped with any of these multi-threaded architecture technologies. Furthermore, the examples that can be used on clusters today are all strongly coupled with a particular aligner. In this paper we introduce an alignment framework that can be leveraged to coordinately run any single-node aligner, taking advantage of the resources of a cluster without having to modify any portion of the original software. The key to our transparent migration lies in hiding the complexity associated with the multi-node execution (such as coordinating the processes running in the cluster nodes) inside the generic-aligner framework. Moreover, following the design and operation in our Message Passing Interface (MPI) version of HPG Aligner RNA BWT, we organize the framework into two stages in order to be able to execute different aligners in each one of them. With this configuration, for example, the first stage can ideally apply a fast aligner to accelerate the process, while the second one can be tuned to act as a refinement stage that further improves the global alignment process with little cost.

N2  - Background: The usual analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads is based on an existing reference genome and annotated gene models. However, when a reference for the sequenced species is not available, alternatives include using a reference genome from a related species or reconstructing transcript sequences with de novo assembly. In addition, researchers are faced with many options for RNA-seq data processing and limited information on how their decisions will impact the final outcome. Using both a diploid and polyploid species with a distant reference genome, we have tested the influence of different tools at various steps of a typical RNA-seq analysis workflow on the recovery of useful processed data available for downstream analysis. Findings: At the preprocessing step, we found error correction has a strong influence on de novo assembly but not on mapping results. After trimming, a greater percentage of reads could be used in downstream analysis by selecting gentle quality trimming performed with Skewer instead of strict quality trimming with Trimmomatic. This availability of reads correlated with size, quality, and completeness of de novo assemblies and with number of mapped reads. When selecting a reference genome from a related species to map reads, outcome was significantly improved when using mapping software tolerant of greater sequence divergence, such as Stampy or GSNAP. Conclusions: The selection of bioinformatic software tools for RNA-seq data analysis can maximize quality parameters on de novo assemblies and availability of reads in downstream analysis.

N2  - Discordant phenotypes and diseases in Monozygotic twins (MZ) are always intriguing and genetics is the exclusive reason. Down syndrome is one such disorder, which shows heterogeneity, with occurrences of incidental diseases discordant between cases. When such disease discordance is noted in Down syndromic MZ twins, it becomes a true genetic case and the necessity to uncover the pathogenic variants becomes imperative. One such case of MZ twins reported by an earlier study failed to identify the pathogenic variants behind the discordance between Congenital Heart Defect (CHD) and Epilepsy. In the current study, using the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) datasets of the original investigators along with our custom variant identification pipeline, we investigated the consequences of damaging novel and rare discordant mutations in TGFBR2, for CHD; ITPR1 and RYR2 for Epilepsy. TGFBR2 was identified with a frameshift deletion resulting in a stop gain mutation and appeared to be dominant in function causing Ventricular Septal Defect in the older Down syndrome twin, while nonsynonymous heterozygous substitutions was identified in ITPR1 and RYR2, causing epileptic seizures in the younger twin. Pathway analysis on mutant genes revealed disruption of several processes such as vascular septal formation for TGFBR2, and calcium signalling for ITPR1 and RYR2. The present investigation identified novel discordant mutations relevant to the discordant disease presented, using appropriate analysis and pipelines.

N2  - Gene functionality is closely connected to its expression specificity across tissues and cell types. RNA-Seq is a powerful quantitative tool to explore genome wide expression. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive RNA-Seq dataset across the same 13 tissues for mouse and rat, two of the most relevant species for biomedical research. The dataset provides the transcriptome across tissues from three male C57BL6 mice and three male Han Wistar rats. We also describe our bioinformatics pipeline to process and technically validate the data. Principal component analysis shows that tissue samples from both species cluster similarly. We show by comparative genomics that many genes with high sequence identity with respect to their human orthologues also have a highly correlated tissue distribution profile and are in agreement with manually curated literature data for human. In summary, the present study provides a unique resource for comparative genomics and will facilitate the analysis of tissue specificity and cross-species conservation in higher organisms.

N2  - TAL1/SCL is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). TAL1 and its regulatory partners (GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB) positively regulate each other and coordinately regulate the expression of their downstream target genes in T-ALL cells. However, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulated by these factors are largely unknown. Here we established a bioinformatics pipeline and analyzed RNA-seq datasets with deep coverage to identify lncRNAs regulated by TAL1 in T-ALL cells. Our analysis predicted 57 putative lncRNAs that are activated by TAL1. Many of these transcripts were regulated by GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB in a coordinated manner. We identified two novel transcripts that were activated in multiple T-ALL cell samples but were downregulated in normal thymocytes. One transcript near the ARID5B gene locus was specifically expressed in TAL1 -positive T-ALL cases. The other transcript located between the FAM49A and MYCN gene locus was also expressed in normal hematopoietic stem cells and T-cell progenitor cells. In addition, we identified a subset of lncRNAs that were negatively regulated by TAL1 and positively regulated by E-proteins in T-ALL cells. This included a known lncRNA (lnc-OAZ3-2:7) located near the RORC gene, which was expressed in normal thymocytes but repressed in TAL1 -positive T-ALL cells.

N2  - We assessed the performance characteristics of an RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) assay designed to detect gene fusions in 571 genes to help manage patients with cancer. Polyadenylated RNA was converted to cDNA, which was then used to prepare next-generation sequencing libraries that were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument and analyzed with an in-house developed bioinformatic pipeline. The assay identified 38 of 41 gene fusions detected by another method, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization or RT-PCR, for a sensitivity of 93%. No false-positive gene fusions were identified in 15 normal tissue specimens and 10 tumor specimens that were negative for fusions by RNA sequencing or Mate Pair NGS (100% specificity). The assay also identified 22 fusions in 17 tumor specimens that had not been detected by other methods. Eighteen of the 22 fusions had not previously been described. Good intra-assay and interassay reproducibility was observed with complete concordance for the presence or absence of gene fusions in replicates. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was tested by diluting RNA isolated from gene fusion-positive cases with fusion-negative RNA. Gene fusions were generally detectable down to 12.5% dilutions for most fusions and as little as 3% for some fusions. This assay can help identify fusions in patients with cancer; these patients may in turn benefit from both US Food and Drug Administration-approved and investigational targeted therapies.

N2  - Background: Allele-specific transcriptional regulation, including of imprinted genes, is essential for normal mammalian development. While the regulatory regions controlling imprinted genes are associated with DNA methylation (DNAme) and specific histone modifications, the interplay between transcription and these epigenetic marks at allelic resolution is typically not investigated genome-wide due to a lack of bioinformatic packages that can process and integrate multiple epigenomic datasets with allelic resolution. In addition, existing ad-hoc software only consider SNVs for allele-specific read discovery. This limitation omits potentially informative INDELs, which constitute about one fifth of the number of SNVs in mice, and introduces a systematic reference bias in allele-specific analyses. Results: Here, we describe MEA, an INDEL-aware Methylomic and Epigenomic Allele-specific analysis pipeline which enables user-friendly data exploration, visualization and interpretation of allelic imbalance. Applying MEA to mouse embryonic datasets yields robust allele-specific DNAme maps and low reference bias. We validate allele-specific DNAme at known differentially methylated regions and show that automated integration of such methylation data with RNA-and ChIP-seq datasets yields an intuitive, multidimensional view of allelic gene regulation. MEA uncovers numerous novel dynamically methylated loci, highlighting the sensitivity of our pipeline. Furthermore, processing and visualization of epigenomic datasets from human brain reveals the expected allele-specific enrichment of H3K27ac and DNAme at imprinted as well as novel monoallelically expressed genes, highlighting MEA's utility for integrating human datasets of distinct provenance for genome-wide analysis of allelic phenomena. Conclusions: Our novel pipeline for standardized allele-specific processing and visualization of disparate epigenomic and methylomic datasets enables rapid analysis and navigation with allelic resolution.

N2  - Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been proposed as a suitable tool for liquid biopsy in colorectal cancer (CRC), although most studies to date have focused almost exclusively on sequencing of panels of potential clinically actionable genes. We evaluated the clinical value of whole-exome sequencing (WES) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in plasma, with the goal of identifying differential clinical profiles in patients with CRC. To this end, we applied an original concept, "differential presence of exons" (DPE). We determined differences in levels of 379 exons in plasma cfDNA and used DPE analysis to cluster and classify patients with disseminated and localized disease. The resultant bioinformatics analysis pipeline allowed us to design a predictive DPE algorithm in a small subset of patients that could not be initially classified based on the selection criteria. This DPE suggests that these nucleic acids could be actively released by both tumor and nontumor cells as a means of intercellular communication and might thus play a role in the process of malignant transformation. DPE is a new technique for the study of plasma cfDNA by WES that might have predictive and prognostic value in patients with CRC.

N2  - Objective To uncover the microRNA (miRNA) interactome of the osteoarthritis (OA) pathophysiological process in the cartilage. Methods We performed RNA sequencing in 130 samples (n=35 and n=30 pairs for messenger RNA (mRNA) and miRNA, respectively) on macroscopically preserved and lesioned OA cartilage from the same patient and performed differential expression (DE) analysis of miRNA and mRNAs. To build an OA-specific miRNA interactome, a prioritisation scheme was applied based on inverse Pearson's correlations and inverse DE of miRNAs and mRNAs. Subsequently, these were filtered by those present in predicted (TargetScan/microT-CDS) and/or experimentally validated (miRTarBase/TarBase) public databases. Pathway enrichment analysis was applied to elucidate OA-related pathways likely mediated by miRNA regulatory mechanisms. Results We found 142 miRNAs and 2387 mRNAs to be differentially expressed between lesioned and preserved OA articular cartilage. After applying prioritisation towards likely miRNA-mRNA targets, a regulatory network of 62 miRNAs targeting 238 mRNAs was created. Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis of these mRNAs (or genes) elucidated that genes within the 'nervous system development' are likely mediated by miRNA regulatory mechanisms (familywise error = 8.4 x 10(-5)). Herein NTF3 encodes neurotrophin-3, which controls survival and differentiation of neurons and which is closely related to the nerve growth factor. Conclusions By an integrated approach of miRNA and mRNA sequencing data of OA cartilage, an OA miRNA interactome and related pathways were elucidated. Our functional data demonstrated interacting levels at which miRNA affects expression of genes in the cartilage and exemplified the complexity of functionally validating a network of genes that may be targeted by multiple miRNAs.

N2  - aSummary: Advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing have enabled more efficient detection of fusion transcripts, but the technology and associated software used for fusion detection from sequencing data often yield a high false discovery rate. Good prioritization of the results is important, and this can be helped by a visualization framework that automatically integrates RNA data with known genomic features. Here we present chimeraviz, a Bioconductor package that automates the creation of chimeric RNA visualizations. The package supports input from nine different fusion-finder tools: deFuse, EricScript, InFusion, JAFFA, FusionCatcher, FusionMap, PRADA, SOAPfuse and STAR-FUSION.

N2  - Background Material and Methods Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a global public health problem, which increases in prevalence every year. Evidence brings up that small populations of stem cells, the cancer stem cells (CSC), are responsible for tumour initiation, tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis. These cells play a crucial role in cancer development and treatment response, but the origin of CSCs remains unclear. In this research, we have sequenced the entire exome of the three different groups of cells of primary squamous cell carcinoma tumour from different patients, with the aim to understand their main genetic changes and to elucidate the possible origin of tumour cells and tumour stem cells. We performed a whole exome sequencing in the germinal line, tumour cells, and CSC ALDH+ samples from four HNSCC patients. An analysis pipeline was used to filter, score, rank, and prioritize candidate variants according to its effect on protein structure and phylogenetic conservation using available information on pathways and protein function databases. Results Conclusions Results showed variations in genes involved in oncogenic pathways and shed light on the evolution model of the CSC and tumour cells for each patient in which stem cells (CS) triggered the formation of CSC and these in turn become tumour cells. These findings support the idea that it is possible to identify in each individual patient if the CS are of tumour origin or vice versa, thus being possible a more personalized treatment.

N2  - Ciliopathies are a group of rare disorders characterized by a high genetic and phenotypic variability, which complicates their molecular diagnosis. Hence the need to use the latest powerful approaches to faster identify the genetic defect in these patients. We applied whole exome sequencing to six consanguineous families clinically diagnosed with ciliopathy- like disease, and for which mutations in predominant Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) genes had previously been excluded. Our strategy, based on first applying several filters to ciliary variants and using many of the bioinformatics tools available, allowed us to identify causal mutations in BBS2, ALMS1 and CRB1 genes in four families, thus confirming the molecular diagnosis of ciliopathy. In the remaining two families, after first rejecting the presence of pathogenic variants in common cilia-related genes, we adopted a new filtering strategy combined with prioritisation tools to rank the final candidate genes for each case. Thus, we propose CORO2B, LMO7 and ZNF17 as novel candidate ciliary genes, but further functional studies will be needed to confirm their role. Our data show the usefulness of this strategy to diagnose patients with unclear phenotypes, and therefore the success of applying such technologies to achieve a rapid and reliable molecular diagnosis, improving genetic counselling for these patients. In addition, the described pipeline also highlights the common pitfalls associated to the large volume of data we have to face and the difficulty of assigning a functional role to these changes, hence the importance of designing the most appropriate strategy according to each case.
