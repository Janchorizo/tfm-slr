AB  - Next generation sequencing of the RNA content of single cells or single nuclei (sc/nRNA-seq) has become a powerful approach to understand the cellular complexity and diversity of multicellular organisms and environmental ecosystems. However, the fact that the procedure begins with a relatively small amount of starting material, thereby pushing the limits of the laboratory procedures required, dictates that careful approaches for sample quality control (QC) are essential to reduce the impact of technical noise and sample bias in downstream analysis applications. Here we present a preliminary framework for sample level quality control that is based on the collection of a series of quantitative laboratory and data metrics that are used as features for the construction of QC classification models using random forest machine learning approaches. We've applied this initial framework to a dataset comprised of 2272 single nuclei RNA-seq results and determined that similar to 79% of samples were of high quality. Removal of the poor quality samples from downstream analysis was found to improve the cell type clustering results. In addition, this approach identified quantitative features related to the proportion of unique or duplicate reads and the proportion of reads remaining after quality trimming as useful features for pass/fail classification. The construction and use of classification models for the identification of poor quality samples provides for an objective and scalable approach to sc/nRNA-seq quality control.

AB  - Microarray analysis of the multiple myeloma (MM) miRNome has unraveled the differential expression of miRNAs in cytogenetic subgroups, their involvement in the tumor biology and their effectiveness in prognostic models. Herein, the small RNA transcriptional landscape in MM has been investigated exploiting the possibilities offered by small RNA-seq, including accurate quantification of known mature species, discovery and characterization of isomiRs, and miRNA-offset RNAs (moRNAs). Matched small RNA-seq and miRNA GeneChip (R) microarray expression profiles were obtained in a representative panel of 30 primary MM tumors, fully characterized for genomic aberrations and mutations. RNA-seq and microarray gave concordant estimations of known species. Enhanced analysis of RNA-seq data with the miR&moRe pipeline led to the characterization of 655 known and 17 new mature miRNAs and of 74 moRNAs expressed in the considered cohort, 5 of which (moR-150-3p, moR-24-2-5p, moR-421-5p, moR-21-5p, and moR-6724-5p) at high level. Ectopic expression of miR-135a-3p in t(4;14) patients, upregulation of moR-150-3p and moR-21-5p in t(14;16)/t(14;20) samples, and of moR-6724-1-5p in patients overexpressing CCND1 were uncovered and validated by qRT-PCR. Overall, RNA-seq offered a more complete overview of small non-coding RNA in MM tumors, indicating specific moRNAs that demand further investigations to explore their role in MM biology.

AB  - Next generation sequencing (NGS) has traditionally been performed in various fields including agricultural to clinical and there are so many sequencing platforms available in order to obtain accurate and consistent results. However, these platforms showed amplification bias when facilitating variant calls in personal genomes. Here, we sequenced whole genomes and whole exomes from ten Korean individuals using Illumina and Ion Proton, respectively to find the vulnerability and accuracy of NGS platform in the GC rich/poor area. Overall, a total of 1013 Gb reads from Illumina and similar to 39.1 Gb reads from Ion Proton were analyzed using BWA-GATK variant calling pipeline. Furthermore, conjunction with the VQSR tool and detailed filtering strategies, we achieved high-quality variants. Finally, each of the ten variants from Illumina only, Ion Proton only, and intersection was selected for Sanger validation. The validation results revealed that Illumina platform showed higher accuracy than Ion Proton. The described filtering methods are advantageous for large population-based whole genome studies designed to identify common and rare variations associated with complex diseases.

AB  - Lipid production in the industrial microalga Nannochloropsis gaditana exceeds that of model algal species and can be maximized by nutrient starvation in batch culture. However, starvation halts growth, thereby decreasing productivity. Efforts to engineer N. gaditana strains that can accumulate biomass and overproduce lipids have previously met with little success. We identified 20 transcription factors as putative negative regulators of lipid production by using RNA-seq analysis of N. gaditana during nitrogen deprivation. Application of a CRISPR-Cas9 reverse-genetics pipeline enabled insertional mutagenesis of 18 of these 20 transcription factors. Knocking out a homolog of fungal Zn(II)(2)Cys(6)-encoding genes improved partitioning of total carbon to lipids from 20% (wild type) to 40-55% (mutant) in nutrient-replete conditions. Knockout mutants grew poorly, but attenuation of Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) expression yielded strains producing twice as much lipid (similar to 5.0 g m(-2) d(-1)) as that in the wild type (similar to 2.5 g m(-2) d(-1)) under semicontinuous growth conditions and had little effect on growth.

AB  - Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is an X-linked rare dominant disorder of autophagy. The role of WDR45 has been implicated in BPAN almost exclusively in females possibly due to male lethality. Characterization of distinctive clinical manifestations and potentially the complex genetic determinants in rare male patients remain crucial for deciphering BPAN and other X-linked dominant diseases. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) followed by segregation analysis and identified a novel nonsense and mosaic variant in WDR45, namely NM_007075.3:c.873C>G; p.(Tyr291*) in an affected male at the age of 34. His biphasic medical history was compatible with BPAN, which was characterized by delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, and progression into dystonia parkinsonism in his twenties. The variant had an apparently mosaic pattern both in whole exome and Sanger sequencing findings. In order to figure out if mosaicism was restricted to this variant or related to a chromosomal level mosaicism, we used our in-house WES data from 129 unrelated individuals to calculate the threshold values of male and female X chromosome heterozygosity (XcHet) in WES data for our pipeline. A background level of heterozygous variants on X chromosome excluding the pseudoautosomal loci is an observed phenomenon in WES analysis and this level has been used as a quality measure. Herein, we suggest utilization of this measure for detection of digital anomalies of the X chromosome in males by potentially observing a higher XcHet value than the threshold value. This approach has revealed a variant level mosaicism in the affected male, which was further supported with cytogenetic analyses.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic and clinical heterogeneity. The interplay of de novo and inherited rare variants has been suspected in the development of ASD. Here, we applied whole exome sequencing (WES) on 19 trios from singleton Saudi families with ASD. We developed an analysis pipeline that allows capturing both de novo and inherited rare variants predicted to be deleterious. A total of 47 unique rare variants were detected in 17 trios including 38 which are newly discovered. The majority were either autosomal recessive or X-linked. Our pipeline uncovered variants in 15 ASD-candidate genes, including 5 (GLT8D1, HTATSF1, OR6C65, ITIH6 and DDX26B) that have not been reported in any human condition. The remaining variants occurred in genes formerly associated with ASD or other neurological disorders. Examples include SUMF1, KDM5B and MXRA5 (Known-ASD genes), PRODH2 and KCTD21 (implicated in schizophrenia), as well as USP9X and SMS (implicated in intellectual disability). Consistent with expectation and previous studies, most of the genes implicated herein are enriched for biological processes pertaining to neuronal function. Our findings underscore the private and heterogeneous nature of the genetic architecture of ASD even in a population with high consanguinity rates.

AB  - Data mining algorithms and sequencing methods (such as RNA-seq and ChIP-seq) are being combined to discover genomic regulatory motifs that relate to a variety of phenotypes. However, motif discovery algorithms often produce very long lists of putative transcription factor binding sites, hindering the discovery of phenotype-related regulatory elements by making it difficult to select a manageable set of candidate motifs for experimental validation. To address this issue, the authors introduce the motif selection problem and provide coverage-based search heuristics for its solution. Analysis of 203 ChIP-seq experiments from the ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements project shows that our algorithms produce motifs that have high sensitivity and specificity and reveals new insights about the regulatory code of the human genome. The greedy algorithm performs the best, selecting a median of two motifs per ChIP-seq transcription factor group while achieving a median sensitivity of 77 percent.

AB  - Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) studies profile thousands of cells in heterogeneous environments. Current methods for characterizing cells perform unsupervised analysis followed by assignment using a small set of known marker genes. Such approaches are limited to a few, well characterized cell types. We developed an automated pipeline to download, process, and annotate publicly available scRNA-seq datasets to enable large scale supervised characterization. We extend supervised neural networks to obtain efficient and accurate representations for scRNA-seq data. We apply our pipeline to analyze data from over 500 different studies with over 300 unique cell types and show that supervised methods outperform unsupervised methods for cell type identification. A case study highlights the usefulness of these methods for comparing cell type distributions in healthy and diseased mice. Finally, we present scQuery, a web server which uses our neural networks and fast matching methods to determine cell types, key genes, and more.

AB  - Background: Allele-specific transcriptional regulation, including of imprinted genes, is essential for normal mammalian development. While the regulatory regions controlling imprinted genes are associated with DNA methylation (DNAme) and specific histone modifications, the interplay between transcription and these epigenetic marks at allelic resolution is typically not investigated genome-wide due to a lack of bioinformatic packages that can process and integrate multiple epigenomic datasets with allelic resolution. In addition, existing ad-hoc software only consider SNVs for allele-specific read discovery. This limitation omits potentially informative INDELs, which constitute about one fifth of the number of SNVs in mice, and introduces a systematic reference bias in allele-specific analyses. Results: Here, we describe MEA, an INDEL-aware Methylomic and Epigenomic Allele-specific analysis pipeline which enables user-friendly data exploration, visualization and interpretation of allelic imbalance. Applying MEA to mouse embryonic datasets yields robust allele-specific DNAme maps and low reference bias. We validate allele-specific DNAme at known differentially methylated regions and show that automated integration of such methylation data with RNA-and ChIP-seq datasets yields an intuitive, multidimensional view of allelic gene regulation. MEA uncovers numerous novel dynamically methylated loci, highlighting the sensitivity of our pipeline. Furthermore, processing and visualization of epigenomic datasets from human brain reveals the expected allele-specific enrichment of H3K27ac and DNAme at imprinted as well as novel monoallelically expressed genes, highlighting MEA's utility for integrating human datasets of distinct provenance for genome-wide analysis of allelic phenomena. Conclusions: Our novel pipeline for standardized allele-specific processing and visualization of disparate epigenomic and methylomic datasets enables rapid analysis and navigation with allelic resolution. MEA is freely available as a Docker container at https://github.com/julienrichardalbert/MEA.

AB  - The recent development of single-cell RNA sequencing has deepened our understanding of the cell as a functional unit, providing new insights based on gene expression profiles of hundreds to hundreds of thousands of individual cells, and revealing new populations of cells with distinct gene expression profiles previously hidden within analyses of gene expression performed on bulk cell populations. However, appropriate analysis and utilization of the massive amounts of data generated from single-cell RNA sequencing experiments are challenging and require an understanding of the experimental and computational pathways taken between preparation of input cells and output of interpretable data. In this review, we will discuss the basic principles of these new technologies, focusing on concepts important in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Specifically, we summarize approaches to quality-control measures for determination of which single cells to include for further examination, methods of data normalization and scaling to overcome the relatively inefficient capture rate of mRNA from each cell, and clustering and visualization algorithms used for dimensional reduction of the data to a two-dimensional plot.

AB  - Background: Exon recognition and splicing precisely and efficiently by spliceosome is the key to generate mature mRNAs. About one third or a half of disease-related mutations affect RNA splicing. Software PVAAS has been developed to identify variants associated with aberrant splicing by directly using RNA-seq data. However, it bases on the assumption that annotated splicing site is normal splicing, which is not true in fact. Results: We develop the ISVASE, a tool for specifically identifying sequence variants associated with splicing events (SVASE) by using RNA-seq data. Comparing with PVAAS, our tool has several advantages, such as multi-pass stringent rule-dependent filters and statistical filters, only using split-reads, independent sequence variant identification in each part of splicing (junction), sequence variant detection for both of known and novel splicing event, additional exon-exon junction shift event detection if known splicing events provided, splicing signal evaluation, known DNA mutation and/or RNA editing data supported, higher precision and consistency, and short running time. Using a realistic RNA-seq dataset, we performed a case study to illustrate the functionality and effectiveness of our method. Moreover, the output of SVASEs can be used for downstream analysis such as splicing regulatory element study and sequence variant functional analysis. Conclusions: ISVASE is useful for researchers interested in sequence variants (DNA mutation and/or RNA editing) associated with splicing events. The package is freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/isvase/.

AB  - Intermolecular interactions of ncRNAs are at the core of gene regulation events, and identifying the full map of these interactions bears crucial importance for ncRNA functional studies. It is known that RNA-RNA interactions are built up by complementary base pairings between interacting RNAs and high level of complementarity between two RNA sequences is a powerful predictor of such interactions. Here, we present RIsearch2, a large-scale RNA-RNA interaction prediction tool that enables quick localization of potential near-complementary RNA-RNA interactions between given query and target sequences. In contrast to previous heuristics which either search for exact matches while including G-U wobble pairs or employ simplified energy models, we present a novel approach using a single integrated seed-and-extend framework based on suffix arrays. RIsearch2 enables fast discovery of candidate RNA-RNA interactions on genome/transcriptome-wide scale. We furthermore present an siRNA off-target discovery pipeline that not only predicts the off-target transcripts but also computes the off-targeting potential of a given siRNA. This is achieved by combining genome-wide RIsearch2 predictions with target site accessibilities and transcript abundance estimates. We show that this pipeline accurately predicts siRNA off-target interactions and enables off-targeting potential comparisons between different siRNA designs. RIsearch2 and the siRNA off-target discovery pipeline are available as stand-alone software packages from http://rth.dk/resources/risearch.

AB  - A Summary: The wide range of RNA-seq applications and their high-computational needs require the development of pipelines orchestrating the entire workflow and optimizing usage of available computational resources. We present aRNApipe, a project-oriented pipeline for processing of RNA-seq data in high-performance cluster environments. aRNApipe is highly modular and can be easily migrated to any high-performance computing (HPC) environment. The current applications included in aRNApipe combine the essential RNA-seq primary analyses, including quality control metrics, transcript alignment, count generation, transcript fusion identification, alternative splicing and sequence variant calling. aRNApipe is project-oriented and dynamic so users can easily update analyses to include or exclude samples or enable additional processing modules. Workflow parameters are easily set using a single configuration file that provides centralized tracking of all analytical processes. Finally, aRNApipe incorporates interactive web reports for sample tracking and a tool for managing the genome assemblies available to perform an analysis.

AB  - Developmental neuronal remodeling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism required for precise wiring of nervous systems. Despite its fundamental role in neurodevelopment and proposed contribution to various neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we uncover the fine temporal transcriptional landscape of Drosophila mushroom body gamma neurons undergoing stereotypical remodeling. Our data reveal rapid and dramatic changes in the transcriptional landscape during development. Focusing on DNA binding proteins, we identify eleven that are required for remodeling. Furthermore, we sequence developing y neurons perturbed for three key transcription factors required for pruning. We describe a hierarchical network featuring positive and negative feedback loops. Superimposing the perturbation-seq on the developmental expression atlas highlights a framework of transcriptional modules that together drive remodeling. Overall, this study provides a broad and detailed molecular insight into the complex regulatory dynamics of developmental remodeling and thus offers a pipeline to dissect developmental processes via RNA profiling.

AB  - Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing developed by PacBio, also called third-generation sequencing (TGS), offers longer reads than the second-generation sequencing (SGS). Given its ability to obtain full-length transcripts without assembly, isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) of transcriptomes by PacBio is advantageous for genome annotation, identification of novel genes and isoforms, as well as the discovery of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). In addition, Iso-Seq gives access to the direct detection of alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation (APA), gene fusion, and DNA modifications. Such applications of Iso-Seq facilitate the understanding of gene structure, post-transcriptional regulatory networks, and subsequently proteomic diversity. In this review, we summarize its applications in plant transcriptome study, specifically pointing out challenges associated with each step in the experimental design and highlight the development of bioinformatic pipelines. We aim to provide the community with an integrative overview and a comprehensive guidance to Iso-Seq, and thus to promote its applications in plant research.

AB  - Adaptation of S. cerevisiae to toxic concentrations of manganese provides a physiological model of heavy metal homeostasis. Transcriptome analysis of adapted yeast cells reveals upregulation of cell wall and plasma membrane proteins including membrane transporters. The gene expression in adapted cells differs from that of cells under short-term toxic metal stress. Among the most significantly upregulated genes are PMA2, encoding an ortholog of Pma1 H+-ATPase of the plasma membrane, and YBR056W-A, encoding a putative membrane protein Mnc1 that belongs to the CYSTM family and presumably chelates manganese at the cell surface. We demonstrate that these genes are essential for the adaptation to toxic manganese concentration and propose an extended scheme of manganese detoxification in yeast.

AB  - Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) fulfil specific biological roles in cells and, thus, their expression may be adapted to suit specific circumstances. This is in part achieved through selective gene transcription and post-transcriptional events, the regulation of which must be tightly integrated and controlled. To comprehensively study the coordinated effects of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory elements, and to obtain coherent results, it is advisable to use different methodologies. Adequately integrating the data derived from these distinct methodologies then becomes critical to elucidating the relationships between the coordinated cellular effects assayed, particularly when applied to normal and disease states. Such integrated studies are likely to be particularly useful to identify markers suitable for early detection of diseases and to devise strategies for therapeutic interventions. Throughout this chapter, we will focus on the methods currently available to analyse mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression, paying special attention to the influence of miRNAs on mRNA metabolism. We will introduce miARtna-Seq, a comprehensive pipeline that facilitates the simultaneous integration of mRNA and miRNA expression data. For illustrative purposes, we include a case study that incorporates data from RNASeq and small-RNASeq, detailing all the steps necessary to define the differential expression of both mRNA- and miRNA-encoding genes. Finally, we explore the possible regulatory relationships that drive significant and potentially relevant changes in mRNA and miRNA gene expression.

AB  - Exome sequencing is becoming widely popular and affordable, making it one of the most desirable methods for the identification of rare genetic variants for clinical diagnosis. Here, we report the clinical application of whole exome sequencing for the ultimate diagnosis of a ciliary chondrodysplasia case presented with an initial clinical diagnosis of Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy (ATD, Jeune Syndrome). We have identified a novel homozygous missense mutation in WDR35 (c. 206G > A), a gene previously associated with Sensenbrenner Syndrome, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome and Short-rib polydactyly syndrome type V. The genetic findings in this family led to the re-evaluation of the initial diagnosis and a differential diagnosis of Sensenbrenner Syndrome was made after cautious re-examination of the patient. Cell culture studies revealed normal subcellular localization of the mutant WDR35 protein in comparison to wildtype protein, pointing towards impaired protein-protein interaction and/or altered cell signaling pathways as a consequence of the mutated allele. This research study highlights the importance of including pathogenic variant identification in the diagnosis pipeline of ciliary chondrodysplasias, especially for clinically not fully defined phenotypes.

AB  - Biomarkers are cornerstones of healthcare spanning a wide spectrum of applications like disease diagnosis and stratification of patient populations. Despite significant efforts that have identified thousands of potential biomarkers, their translation into clinical practice remains poor: less than two approvals per year across all diseases. In part, this inefficiency arises from experimental limitations on the biomarker discovery pipeline. Widely used mass-spectrometry approaches suffer from sample throughput whereas targeted approaches such as immunoassays suffer from low multiplexability. On top of the technological limitations, the current single-biomarker-to-single-disease approach does not capture the multifactorial nature of complex diseases. Hence, mechanism based biomarker discovery aims to identify signatures that capture the diversity of the disease's origin and deliver more precise diagnostic and predictive information.

AB  - Motivation: The convolutional neural network (CNN) has been applied to the classification problem of DNA sequences, with the additional purpose of motif discovery. The training of CNNs with distributed representations of four nucleotides has successfully derived position weight matrices on the learned kernels that corresponded to sequence motifs such as protein-binding sites. Results: We propose a novel application of CNNs to classification of pairwise alignments of sequences for accurate clustering of sequences and show the benefits of the CNN method of inputting pairwise alignments for clustering of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences and for motif discovery. Classification of a pairwise alignment of two sequences into positive and negative classes corresponds to the clustering of the input sequences. After we combined the distributed representation of RNA nucleotides with the secondary-structure information specific to ncRNAs and furthermore with mapping profiles of next-generation sequence reads, the training of CNNs for classification of alignments of RNA sequences yielded accurate clustering in terms of ncRNA families and outperformed the existing clustering methods for ncRNA sequences. Several interesting sequence motifs and secondary-structure motifs known for the snoRNA family and specific to microRNA and tRNA families were identified.

AB  - Repetitive DNA sequences represent about half of the human genome. They have a central role in human biology, especially neurobiology, but are notoriously difficult to study. The purpose of this study was to quantify the transcription from repetitive sequences in a progerin-expressing cellular model of neuronal aging. Progerin is a nuclear protein causative of the Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome that is also incrementally expressed during the normal aging process. A dedicated pipeline of analysis allowed to quantify transcripts containing repetitive sequences from RNAseq datasets oblivious of their genomic localization, tolerating a sufficient degree of mutational noise, all with low computational requirements. The pipeline has been applied to a published panel of RNAseq datasets derived from a well-established and well-described cellular model of aging of dopaminergic neurons. Progerin expression strongly downregulated the transcription from all the classes of repetitive sequences: satellites, long and short interspersed nuclear elements, human endogenous retroviruses, and DNA transposon. The Alu element represented by far the principal source of transcript originating either from repetitive sequences or from canonical coding genes; it was expressed on average at 192,493.5 reads per kilobase million (RPKM) (SE=21,081.3) in the control neurons and dropped to 43,760.1 RPKM (SE=5315.0) in the progerin-expressing neurons, being significant downregulated (p=0.0005). The results highlighted a global perturbation of transcripts derived from repetitive sequences in a cellular model of aging and provided a direct link between progerin expression and alteration of transcription from human repetitive elements.

AB  - The use of RNA-seq as the preferred method for the discovery and validation of small RNA biomarkers has been hindered by high quantitative variability and biased sequence counts. In this paper we develop a statistical model for sequence counts that accounts for ligase bias and stochastic variation in sequence counts. This model implies a linear quadratic relation between the mean and variance of sequence counts. Using a large number of sequencing datasets, we demonstrate how one can use the generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) distributional regression framework to calculate and apply empirical correction factors for ligase bias. Bias correction could remove more than 40% of the bias for miRNAs. Empirical bias correction factors appear to be nearly constant over at least one and up to four orders of magnitude of total RNA input and independent of sample composition. Using synthetic mixes of known composition, we show that the GAMLSS approach can analyze differential expression with greater accuracy, higher sensitivity and specificity than six existing algorithms (DESeq2, edgeR, EBSeq, limma, DSS, voom) for the analysis of small RNA-seq data.

AB  - Background: The 15 sibling species of the Paramecium aurelia cryptic species complex emerged after a whole genome duplication that occurred tens of millions of years ago. Given extensive knowledge of the genetics and epigenetics of Paramecium acquired over the last century, this species complex offers a uniquely powerful system to investigate the consequences of whole genome duplication in a unicellular eukaryote as well as the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that drive speciation. High quality Paramecium gene models are important for research using this system. The major aim of the work reported here was to build an improved gene annotation pipeline for the Paramecium lineage. Results: We generated oriented RNA-Seq transcriptome data across the sexual process of autogamy for the model species Paramecium tetraurelia. We determined, for the first time in a ciliate, candidate P. tetraurelia transcription start sites using an adapted Cap-Seq protocol. We developed TrUC, multi-threaded Perl software that in conjunction with TopHat mapping of RNA-Seq data to a reference genome, predicts transcription units for the annotation pipeline. We used EuGene software to combine annotation evidence. The high quality gene structural annotations obtained for P. tetraurelia were used as evidence to improve published annotations for 3 other Paramecium species. The RNA-Seq data were also used for differential gene expression analysis, providing a gene expression atlas that is more sensitive than the previously established microarray resource. Conclusions: We have developed a gene annotation pipeline tailored for the compact genomes and tiny introns of Paramecium species. A novel component of this pipeline, TrUC, predicts transcription units using Cap-Seq and oriented RNA-Seq data. TrUC could prove useful beyond Paramecium, especially in the case of high gene density. Accurate predictions of 3 ' and 5 ' UTR will be particularly valuable for studies of gene expression (e.g. nucleosome positioning, identification of cis regulatory motifs). The P. tetraurelia improved transcriptome resource, gene annotations for P. tetraurelia, P. biaurelia, P. sexaurelia and P. caudatum, and Paramecium-trained EuGene configuration are available through ParameciumDB (http://paramecium.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr). TrUC software is freely distributed under a GNU GPL v3 licence (https://github.com/oarnaiz/TrUC).

AB  - The recent availability of comprehensive, brain-wide gene expression atlases such as the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) has opened new opportunities for understanding how spatial variations on molecular scale relate to the macroscopic neuroimaging phenotypes. A rapidly growing body of literature is demonstrating relationships between gene expression and diverse properties of brain structure and function, but approaches for combining expression atlas data with neuroimaging are highly inconsistent, with substantial variations in how the expression data are processed. The degree to which these methodological variations affect findings is unclear. Here, we outline a seven-step analysis pipeline for relating brain-wide transcriptomic and neuroimaging data and compare how different processing choices influence the resulting data. We suggest that studies using the AHBA should work towards a unified data processing pipeline to ensure consistent and reproducible results in this burgeoning field.

AB  - Background: Extraordinary progress has been made in our understanding of common variants in many diseases, including melanoma. Because the contribution of rare coding variants is not as well characterized, we performed an exome-wide, gene-based association study of familial cutaneous melanoma (CM) and ocular melanoma (OM). Methods: Using 11 990 jointly processed individual DNA samples, whole-exome sequencing was performed, followed by large-scale joint variant calling using GATK (Genome Analysis ToolKit). PLINK/SEQ was used for statistical analysis of genetic variation. Four models were used to estimate the association among different types of variants. In vitro functional validation was performed using three human melanoma cell lines in 2D and 3D proliferation assays. In vivo tumor growth was assessed using xenografts of human melanoma A375 melanoma cells in nude mice (eight mice per group). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Strong signals were detected for CDKN2A (P-min = 6.16 x 10(-8)) in the CM cohort (n = 273) and BAP1 (P-min = 3.83 x 10(-6)) in the OM (n = 99) cohort. Eleven genes that exhibited borderline association (P < 10(-4)) were independently validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas melanoma cohort (379 CM, 47 OM) and a matched set of 3563 European controls with CDKN2A (P = .009), BAP1 (P = .03), and EBF3 (P = 4.75 x 10(-4)), a candidate risk locus, all showing evidence of replication. EBF3 was then evaluated using germline data from a set of 132 familial melanoma cases and 4769 controls of UK origin (joint P = 1.37 x 10(-5)). Somatically, loss of EBF3 expression correlated with progression, poorer outcome, and high MITF tumors. Functionally, induction of EBF3 in melanoma cells reduced cell growth in vitro, retarded tumor formation in vivo, and reduced MITF levels. Conclusions: The results of this large rare variant germline association study further define the mutational landscape of hereditary melanoma and implicate EBF3 as a possible CM predisposition gene.

AB  - Background: The evolution of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has led to increased focus on RNA-Seq. Many bioinformatic tools have been developed for RNA-Seq analysis, each with unique performance characteristics and configuration parameters. Users face an increasingly complex task in understanding which bioinformatic tools are best for their specific needs and how they should be configured. In order to provide some answers to these questions, we investigate the performance of leading bioinformatic tools designed for RNA-Seq analysis and propose a methodology for systematic evaluation and comparison of performance to help users make well informed choices. Results: To evaluate RNA-Seq pipelines, we developed a suite of two benchmarking tools. SimCT generates simulated datasets that get as close as possible to specific real biological conditions accompanied by the list of genomic incidents and mutations that have been inserted. BenchCT then compares the output of any bioinformatics pipeline that has been run against a SimCT dataset with the simulated genomic and transcriptional variations it contains to give an accurate performance evaluation in addressing specific biological question. We used these tools to simulate a real-world genomic medicine question s involving the comparison of healthy and cancerous cells. Results revealed that performance in addressing a particular biological context varied significantly depending on the choice of tools and settings used. We also found that by combining the output of certain pipelines, substantial performance improvements could be achieved. Conclusion: Our research emphasizes the importance of selecting and configuring bioinformatic tools for the specific biological question being investigated to obtain optimal results. Pipeline designers, developers and users should include benchmarking in the context of their biological question as part of their design and quality control process. Our SimBA suite of benchmarking tools provides a reliable basis for comparing the performance of RNA-Seq bioinformatics pipelines in addressing a specific biological question. We would like to see the creation of a reference corpus of data-sets that would allow accurate comparison between benchmarks performed by different groups and the publication of more benchmarks based on this public corpus. SimBA software and data-set are available at http://cractools.gforge.inria.fr/softwares/simba/.

AB  - Purpose: Although most human cancers display a single histology, there are unusual cases where two ormore distinct tissue types present within a primary tumor. One such example is metaplastic breast carcinoma, a rare but aggressive cancer with a heterogeneous histology, including squamous, chondroid, and spindle cells. Metaplastic carcinomas often contain an admixed conventional ductal invasive or in situ mammary carcinoma component, and are typically triple-negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2 amplification/overexpression. An unanswered question is the origin of metaplastic breast cancers. While they may arise independently from their ductal components, their close juxtaposition favors a model that postulates a shared origin, either as two derivatives from the same primary cancer or one histology as an outgrowth of the other. Understanding the mechanism of development of these tumors may inform clinical decisions. Experimental Design: We performed exome sequencing for paired metaplastic and adjacent conventional invasive ductal carcinomas in 8 patients and created a pipeline to identify somatic variants and predict their functional impact, without having normal tissue. We then determined the genetic relationships between the histologically distinct compartments. Results: In each case, the tumor components have nearly identical landscapes of somatic mutation, implying that the differing histologies do not derive from genetic clonal divergence. Conclusions: A shared origin for tumors with differing histologies suggests that epigenetic or noncoding changes may mediate the metaplastic phenotype and that alternative therapeutic approaches, including epigenetic therapies, may be required for metaplastic breast cancers.

AB  - Knowledge of immune cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment is essential for understanding mechanisms of cancer progression and immunotherapy response. We profiled 45,000 immune cells from eight breast carcinomas, as well as matched normal breast tissue, blood, and lymph nodes, using single-cell RNA-seq. We developed a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-cell data. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumor tissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypic expansions specific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000 additional T cells revealed the combinatorial impact of TCR utilization on phenotypic diversity. Our results support a model of continuous activation in T cells and do not comport with the macrophage polarization model in cancer. Our results have important implications for characterizing tumor-infiltrating immune cells.

AB  - Obesity is known to induce pathological changes in the gut and diets rich in complex carbohydrates that resist digestion in the small bowel can alter large bowel ecology. The purposes of this study were to identify the effects of bitter melon powder (BMP) on the global gene expression pattern in the colon mucosa of obese rats. Obese rats were fed a high-fat diet and treated without or with BMP for 8 weeks. Genome-wide expression profiles of the colon mucosa were determined by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis at the end of experiment. A total of 87 genes were identified as differentially expressed (DE) between these two groups (fold change > 1.2). These results were further validated by quantitative RT-PCR, confirming the high reliability of the RNA-Seq. Interestingly, DE genes implicated in inflammation and lipid metabolism were found to be downregulated by BMP in the colon. Network between genes and the top 15 KEGG pathways showed that PRKC beta (protein kinase C beta) and Pla2g2a (phospholipase A2 group IIA) strongly interacted with surrounding pathways and genes. Results revealed that BMP supplement could remodel key colon functions by altering transcriptomic profile in obese rats.

AB  - Background: It is generally thought that most canonical or non-canonical splicing events involving U2- and U12 spliceosomes occur within nuclear pre-mRNAs. However, the question of whether at least some U12-type splicing occurs in the cytoplasm is still unclear. In recent years next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the field. The "Read-Split-Walk" (RSW) and "Read-Split-Run" (RSR) methods were developed to identify genome-wide non-canonical spliced regions including special events occurring in cytoplasm. As the significant amount of genome/transcriptome data such as, Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, have been generated, we have advanced a newer more memory-efficient version of the algorithm, "Read-Split-Fly" (RSF), which can detect non-canonical spliced regions with higher sensitivity and improved speed. The RSF algorithm also outputs the spliced sequences for further downstream biological function analysis. Results: We used open access ENCODE project RNA-Seq data to search spliced intron sequences against the U12-type spliced intron sequence database to examine whether some events could occur as potential signatures of U12-type splicing. The check was performed by searching spliced sequences against 5'ss and 3'ss sequences from the well-known orthologous U12-type spliceosomal intron database U12DB. Preliminary results of searching 70 ENCODE samples indicated that the presence of 5'ss with U12-type signature is more frequent than U2-type and prevalent in non-canonical junctions reported by RSF. The selected spliced sequences have also been further studied using miRBase to elucidate their functionality. Preliminary results from 70 samples of ENCODE datasets show that several miRNAs are prevalent in studied ENCODE samples. Two of these are associated with many diseases as suggested in the literature. Specifically, hsa-miR-1273 and hsa-miR-548 are associated with many diseases and cancers. Conclusions: Our RSF pipeline is able to detect many possible junctions (especially those with a high RPKM) with very high overall accuracy and relative high accuracy for novel junctions. We have incorporated useful parameter features into the pipeline such as, handling variable-length read data, and searching spliced sequences for splicing signatures and miRNA events. We suggest RSF, a tool for identifying novel splicing events, is applicable to study a range of diseases across biological systems under different experimental conditions.

AB  - RNA editing increases the diversity of the transcriptome and proteome. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is the predominant type of RNA editing in mammals and it is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) family. Here, we used a largescale computational analysis of transcriptomic data from brain, heart, colon, lung, spleen, kidney, testes, skeletal muscle and liver, from three adult animals in order to identify RNA editing sites in bovine. We developed a computational pipeline and used a rigorous strategy to identify novel editing sites from RNA-Seq data in the absence of corresponding DNA sequence information. Our methods take into account sequencing errors, mapping bias, as well as biological replication to reduce the probability of obtaining a false-positive result. We conducted a detailed characterization of sequence and structural features related to novel candidate sites and found 1,600 novel canonical A-to-I editing sites in the nine bovine tissues analyzed. Results show that these sites 1) occur frequently in clusters and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) repeats, 2) have a preference for guanines depletion/enrichment in the flanking 50/30 nucleotide, 3) occur less often in coding sequences than other regions of the genome, and 4) have low evolutionary conservation. Further, we found that a positive correlation exists between expression of ADAR family members and tissue-specific RNA editing. Most of the genes with predicted A-to-I editing in each tissue were significantly enriched in biological terms relevant to the function of the corresponding tissue. Lastly, the results highlight the importance of the RNA editome in nervous system regulation. The present study extends the list of RNA editing sites in bovine and provides pipelines that may be used to investigate the editome in other organisms.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was the clinical and molecular characterization of a family segregating a trait consisting of a phenotype specifically involving the maxillary canines, including agenesis, impaction and ectopic eruption, characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Design: Clinical standardized assessment of 14 family members and a whole-exome sequencing (WES) of three affected subjects were performed. WES data analyses (sequence alignment, variant calling, annotation and prioritization) were carried out using an in-house implemented pipeline. Variant filtering retained coding and splice-site high quality private and rare variants. Variant prioritization was performed taking into account both the disruptive impact and the biological relevance of individual variants and genes. Sanger sequencing was performed to validate the variants of interest and to carry out segregation analysis. Results: Prioritization of variants "by function" allowed the identification of multiple variants contributing to the trait, including two concomitant heterozygous variants in EDARADD (c.308C > T, p.Ser103Phe) and COL5A1 (c.1588G > A, p.Gly530Ser), specifically associated with a more severe phenotype (Le. canine agenesis). Differently, heterozygous variants in genes encoding proteins with a role in the WNT pathway were shared by subjects showing a phenotype of impacted/ectopic erupted canines. Conclusions: This study characterized the genetic contribution underlying a complex trait consisting of isolated canine anomalies in a medium-sized family, highlighting the role of WNT and EDA cell signaling pathways in tooth development.

AB  - Alignment is the first step in most RNA-seq analysis pipelines, and the accuracy of downstream analyses depends heavily on it. Unlike most steps in the pipeline, alignment is particularly amenable to benchmarking with simulated data. We performed a comprehensive benchmarking of 14 common splice-aware aligners for base, read, and exon junction-level accuracy and compared default with optimized parameters. We found that performance varied by genome complexity, and accuracy and popularity were poorly correlated. The most widely cited tool underperforms for most metrics, particularly when using default settings.

AB  - The hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans is the causal agent of blackleg disease in Brassica napus (canola, oilseed rape) and causes significant loss of yield worldwide. While genetic resistance has been used to mitigate the disease by means of traditional breeding strategies, there is little knowledge about the genes that contribute to blackleg resistance. RNA sequencing and a streamlined bioinformatics pipeline identified unique genes and plant defense pathways specific to plant resistance in the B.napus-L.maculans LepR1-AvrLepR1 interaction over time. We complemented our temporal analyses by monitoring gene activity directly at the infection site using laser microdissection coupled to quantitative PCR. Finally, we characterized genes involved in plant resistance to blackleg in the Arabidopsis-L.maculans model pathosystem. Data reveal an accelerated activation of the plant transcriptome in resistant host cotyledons associated with transcripts coding for extracellular receptors and phytohormone signaling molecules. Functional characterization provides direct support for transcriptome data and positively identifies resistance regulators in the Brassicaceae. Spatial gradients of gene activity were identified in response to L.maculans proximal to the site of infection. This dataset provides unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution of the genes required for blackleg resistance and serves as a valuable resource for those interested in host-pathogen interactions.

AB  - Recently, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has revealed compelling details about the small RNA (sRNA) population in eukaryotes. These 20 to 25 nt noncoding RNAs can influence gene expression by acting as guides for the sequence-specific regulatory mechanism known as RNA silencing. The increase in sequencing depth and number of samples per project enables a better understanding of the role sRNAs play by facilitating the study of expression patterns. However, the intricacy of the biological hypotheses coupled with a lack of appropriate tools often leads to inadequate mining of the available data and thus, an incomplete description of the biological mechanisms involved. To enable a comprehensive study of differential expression in sRNA data sets, we present a new interactive pipeline that guides researchers through the various stages of data preprocessing and analysis. This includes various tools, some of which we specifically developed for sRNA analysis, for quality checking and normalization of sRNA samples as well as tools for the detection of differentially expressed sRNAs and identification of the resulting expression patterns. The pipeline is available within the UEA sRNA Workbench, a user-friendly software package for the processing of sRNA data sets. We demonstrate the use of the pipeline on a H. sapiens data set; additional examples on a B. terrestris data set and on an A. thaliana data set are described in the Supplemental Information. A comparison with existing approaches is also included, which exemplifies some of the issues that need to be addressed for sRNA analysis and how the new pipeline may be used to do this.

AB  - This study investigates the challenge of comprehensively cataloging the complete human proteome from a single-cell type using mass spectrometry (MS)-based shotgun proteomics. We modify a classical two-dimensional high-resolution reversedphase peptide fractionation scheme and optimize a protocol that provides sufficient peak capacity to saturate the sequencing speed of modern MS instruments. This strategy enables the deepest proteome of a human single-cell type to date, with the HeLa proteome sequenced to a depth of similar to 584,000 unique peptide sequences and similar to 14,200 protein isoforms (similar to 12,200 protein-coding genes). This depth is comparable with next-generation RNA sequencing and enables the identification of post-translational modifications, including similar to 7,000 N-acetylation sites and similar to 10,000 phosphorylation sites, without the need for enrichment. We further demonstrate the general applicability and clinical potential of this proteomics strategy by comprehensively quantifying global proteome expression in several different human cancer cell lines and patient tissue samples.

AB  - Introduction: Family based study designs provide an informative resource to identify disease-causing mutations. The Queensland Parkinson's Project (QPP) has been involved in numerous genetic screening studies; however, details of the families enrolled into the register have not been comprehensively reported. This article characterises the families enrolled in the QPP and summarises monogenic forms of hereditary Parkinsonism found in the register. Method: The presence of pathogenic point mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) were, generally, screened in a sample of over 1000 PD patients from the total of 1725. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on eighteen probands from multiplex families. Results: The QPP contains seventeen incidences of confirmed monogenic forms of PD, including LRRK2 p.G2019S, VPS35 p.D620N, SNCA duplications and PARK2 p.G430D (horn) & exon 4 deletion (hom). Of these seventeen, five belong to multi-incident families, while another eight have a family history of at least one other case of PD. In additional families, WES did not identify known forms of monogenic Parkinsonism; however, three heterozygous mutations in PARK2, p.R275W, p.Q34fs, and a 40bp deletion in exon 3 were identified. Of these three mutations, only the 40bp deletion segregated with disease in a dominant inheritance pattern. Conclusion: Eighteen probands have screened negative for known CNVs and mutations that cause clear monogenic forms of PD. Each family is a candidate for further genetic analysis to identify genetic variants segregating with disease. The families enrolled in the QPP provide a useful resource to aid in identifying novel forms of monogenic PD. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Measuring how gene expression changes in the course of an experiment assesses how an organism responds on a molecular level. Sequencing of RNA molecules, and their subsequent quantification, aims to assess global gene expression changes on the RNA level (transcriptome). While advances in high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies allow for inexpensive data generation, accurate post-processing and normalization across samples is required to eliminate any systematic noise introduced by the biochemical and/or technical processes. Existing methods thus either normalize on selected known reference genes that are invariant in expression across the experiment, assume that the majority of genes are invariant, or that the effects of up-and down-regulated genes cancel each other out during the normalization. Results: Here, we present a novel method, moose(2), which predicts invariant genes in silico through a dynamic programming (DP) scheme and applies a quadratic normalization based on this subset. The method allows for specifying a set of known or experimentally validated invariant genes, which guides the DP. We experimentally verified the predictions of this method in the bacterium Escherichia coli, and show how moose(2) is able to (i) estimate the expression value distances between RNA-seq samples, (ii) reduce the variation of expression values across all samples, and (iii) to subsequently reveal new functional groups of genes during the late stages of DNA damage. We further applied the method to three eukaryotic data sets, on which its performance compares favourably to other methods. The software is implemented in C++ and is publicly available from http://grabherr.github.io/moose2/. Conclusions: The proposed RNA-seq normalization method, moose(2), is a valuable alternative to existing methods, with two major advantages: (i) in silico prediction of invariant genes provides a list of potential reference genes for downstream analyses, and (ii) non-linear artefacts in RNA-seq data are handled adequately to minimize variations between replicates.

AB  - Purpose: As part of the Epilepsy Genetics Initiative, we re-evaluated clinically generated exome sequence data from 54 epilepsy patients and their unaffected parents to identify molecular diagnoses not provided in the initial diagnostic interpretation. Methods: We compiled and analyzed exome sequence data from 54 genetically undiagnosed trios using a validated analysis pipeline. We evaluated the significance of the genetic findings by reanalyzing sequence data generated at Ambry Genetics, and from a number of additional case and control cohorts. Results: In 54 previously undiagnosed trios, we identified two de novo missense variants in SCN8A in the highly expressed alternative exon 5 A-an exon only recently added to the Consensus Coding Sequence database. One additional undiagnosed epilepsy patient harboring a de novo variant in exon 5 A was found in the Ambry Genetics cohort. Missense variants in SCN8A exon 5 A are extremely rare in the population, further supporting the pathogenicity of the de novo alterations identified. Conclusion: These results expand the range of SCN8A variants in epileptic encephalopathy patients and illustrate the necessity of ongoing reanalysis of negative exome sequences, as advances in the knowledge of disease genes and their annotations will permit new diagnoses to be made.

AB  - BackgroundRNA sequencing is a widely used technology for differential expression analysis. However, the RNA-Seq do not provide accurate absolute measurements and the results can be different for each pipeline used. The major problem in statistical analysis of RNA-Seq and in the omics data in general, is the small sample size with respect to the large number of variables. In addition, experimental design must be taken into account and few tools consider it.ResultsWe propose OMICfpp, a method for the statistical analysis of RNA-Seq paired design data. First, we obtain a p-value for each case-control pair using a binomial test. These p-values are aggregated using an ordered weighted average (OWA) with a given orness previously chosen. The aggregated p-value from the original data is compared with the aggregated p-value obtained using the same method applied to random pairs. These new pairs are generated using between-pairs and complete randomization distributions. This randomization p-value is used as a raw p-value to test the differential expression of each gene. The OMICfpp method is evaluated using public data sets of 68 sample pairs from patients with colorectal cancer. We validate our results through bibliographic search of the reported genes and using simulated data set. Furthermore, we compared our results with those obtained by the methods edgeR and DESeq2 for paired samples. Finally, we propose new target genes to validate these as gene expression signatures in colorectal cancer. OMICfpp is available at http://www.uv.es/ayala/software/OMICfpp_0.2.tar.gz.ConclusionsOur study shows that OMICfpp is an accurate method for differential expression analysis in RNA-Seq data with paired design. In addition, we propose the use of randomized p-values pattern graphic as a powerful and robust method to select the target genes for experimental validation.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer (PC) is largely refractory to existing therapies used in unselected patient trials, thus emphasizing the pressing need for new approaches for patient selection in personalized medicine. KRAS mutations occur in 90% of PC patients and confer resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (e.g., panitumumab), suggesting that KRAS wild-type PC patients may benefit from targeted panitumumab therapy. Here, we use tumor tissue procured by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate (EUS-FNA) to compare the in vivo sensitivity in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of KRAS wild-type and mutant PC tumors to panitumumab, and to profile the molecular signature of these tumors in patients with metastatic or localized disease. Specifically, RNASeq of EUS-FNA-derived tumor RNA from localized (n=20) and metastatic (n=20) PC cases revealed a comparable transcriptome profile. Screening the KRAS mutation status of tumor genomic DNA obtained from EUS-FNAs stratified PC patients into either KRAS wild-type or mutant cohorts, and the engraftment of representative KRAS wild-type and mutant EUS-FNA tumor samples into NOD/SCID mice revealed that the growth of KRAS wild-type, but not mutant, PDXs was selectively suppressed with panitumumab. Furthermore, in silico transcriptome interrogation of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-derived KRAS wild-type (n=38) and mutant (n=132) PC tumors revealed 391 differentially expressed genes. Taken together, our study validates EUS-FNA for the application of a novel translational pipeline comprising KRAS mutation screening and PDXs, applicable to all PC patients, to evaluate personalized anti-EGFR therapy in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors. What's new? While pancreatic cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease, 90% of patients exhibit mutations in KRAS. Most patients also respond poorly to generalized treatments, suggesting that patient outcomes may depend on genetic profiling and personalized therapeutic approaches. A potential role for those approaches was explored here, using tumor tissue procured from patients via endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate (EUS-FNA). Patient-derived xenografts were developed and screened for KRAS mutation status and sensitivity to panitumumab. Only KRAS wild-type EUS-FNA patient-derived xenografts were sensitive to the drug. Genetic profiling coupled with EUS-FNA, an existing clinical tool, is suited for rapid translation into clinical trials.

AB  - Blood-based diagnostics tests, using individual or panels of biomarkers, may revolutionize disease diagnostics and enable minimally invasive therapy monitoring. However, selection of the most relevant biomarkers from liquid biosources remains an immense challenge. We recently presented the thromboSeq pipeline, which enables RNA sequencing and cancer classification via self-learning and swarm intelligence-enhanced bioinformatics algorithms using blood platelet RNA. Here, we provide the wet-lab protocol for the generation of platelet RNA-sequencing libraries and the dry-lab protocol for the development of swarm intelligence-enhanced machine-learning-based classification algorithms. The wet-lab protocol includes platelet RNA isolation, mRNA amplification, and preparation for next-generation sequencing. The dry-lab protocol describes the automated FASTQ file pre-processing to quantified gene counts, quality controls, data normalization and correction, and swarm intelligence-enhanced support vector machine (SVM) algorithm development. This protocol enables platelet RNA profiling from 500 pg of platelet RNA and allows automated and optimized biomarker panel selection. The wet-lab protocol can be performed in 5 d before sequencing, and the algorithm development can be completed in 2 d, depending on computational resources. The protocol requires basic molecular biology skills and a basic understanding of Linux and R. In all, with this protocol, we aim to enable the scientific community to test platelet RNA for diagnostic algorithm development.

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) are one of the most economically important parasites of small ruminants and a major animal health concern in many regions of the world. However, the molecular mechanisms of the host response to GIN infections in goat are still little known. In this study, two genetically distinct goat populations, one relatively resistant and the other susceptible to GIN infections, were identified in Yichang goat and then four individuals in each group were chosen to compare mRNA expression profiles using RNA-seq. Field experiment showed lower worm burden, delayed and reduced egg production in the relatively resistant group than the susceptible group. The analysis of RNA-seq showed that 2369 genes, 1407 of which were up-regulated and 962 down-regulated, were significantly (p < 0.001) differentially expressed between these two groups. Functional annotation of the 298 genes more highly expressed in the resistant group yielded a total of 46 significant (p < 0.05) functional annotation clusters including 31 genes (9 in innate immunity, 13 in immunity, and 9 in innate immune response) related to immune biosynthetic process as well as transforming growth factor (TGF)-fi, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) pathways. Our findings provide insights that are immediately relevant for the improvement of host resistance to GIN infections and which will make it possible to know the mechanisms underlying the resistance of goats to GIN infections.

AB  - An estimated 17% of cancers worldwide are associated with infectious causes. The extent and biological significance of viral presence/infection in actual tumor samples is generally unknown but could be measured using human transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from tumor samples. We present an open source bioinformatics pipeline viGEN, which allows for not only the detection and quantification of viral RNA, but also variants in the viral transcripts. The pipeline includes 4 major modules: The first module aligns and filter out human RNA sequences; the second module maps and count (remaining un-aligned) reads against reference genomes of all known and sequenced human viruses; the third module quantifies read counts at the individual viral-gene level thus allowing for downstream differential expression analysis of viral genes between case and controls groups. The fourth module calls variants in these viruses. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available pipelines or packages that would provide this type of complete analysis in one open source package. In this paper, we applied the viGEN pipeline to two case studies. We first demonstrate the working of our pipeline on a large public dataset, the TOGA cervical cancer cohort. In the second case study, we performed an in-depth analysis on a small focused study of TOGA liver cancer patients. In the latter cohort, we performed viral-gene quantification, viral-variant extraction and survival analysis. This allowed us to find differentially expressed viral-transcripts and viral-variants between the groups of patients, and connect them to clinical outcome. From our analyses, we show that we were able to successfully detect the human papilloma virus among the TOGA cervical cancer patients. We compared the viGEN pipeline with two metagenomics tools and demonstrate similar sensitivity/specificity. We were also able to quantify viral-transcripts and extract viral-variants using the liver cancer dataset. The results presented corresponded with published literature in terms of rate of detection, and impact of several known variants of HBV genome. This pipeline is generalizable, and can be used to provide novel biological insights into microbial infections in complex diseases and tumorigeneses. Our viral pipeline could be used in conjunction with additional type of immuno-oncology analysis based on RNA-seq data of host RNA for cancer immunology applications. The source code, with example data and tutorial is available at: https://github.com/ICBI/viGEN/.

AB  - Background: The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is essential for the proper development of the mammalian embryo. A maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals during preimplantation bears the potential for transgenerational inheritance of disease through the epigenetic perturbation of the developing embryo. A comprehensive assembly of embryo-specific miRNAs and respective isoforms (isomiR) is lacking to date. We aimed at revealing the sex-specific miRNA expression profile of single porcine blastocysts developing in gilts orally exposed to exogenous estradiol-17 beta (E2). Therefore we analyzed the miRNA profile specifically focusing on isomiRs and potentially embryo-specific miRNAs. Results: Deep sequencing of small RNA (small RNA-seq) result in the detection of miRNA sequences mapping to known and predicted porcine miRNAs as well as novel miRNAs highly conserved in human and cattle. A set of highly abundant miRNAs and a large number of rarely expressed miRNAs were identified by using a small RNA analysis pipeline, which was integrated into a novel Galaxy workflow specifically benefits incompletely annotated species. In particular, orthologue species information increased the total number of annotated miRNAs, while mapping to other non-coding RNAs avoided falsely annotated miRNAs. Neither the low nor the high dose of E2 treatment (10 and 1000 mu E2/kg body weight daily, respectively) affected the miRNA profile in blastocysts despite the distinct differential mRNA expression and DNA methylation found in previous studies. The high number of generated sequence reads enabled a comprehensive analysis of the isomiR repertoire showing various templated and non-templated modifications. Furthermore, potentially blastocyst-specific miRNAs were identified. Conclusions: In pre-implantation embryos, numerous distinct isomiRs were discovered indicating a high complexity of miRNA expression. Neither the sex of the embryo nor a maternal E2 exposure affected the miRNA expression profile of developing porcine blastocysts. The adaptation to the continuous duration of the E2 treatment might explain the lack of an effect.

AB  - Background: The presentation of HLA peptide complexes to T cells is a highly regulated and tissue specific process involving multiple transcriptionally controlled cellular components. The extensive polymorphism of HLA genes and the complex composition of the proteasome make it difficult to map their expression profiles across tissues. Methods: Here we applied a tailored gene quantification pipeline to 4323 publicly available RNA-Seq datasets representing 55 normal tissues and cell types to examine expression profiles of (classical and non-classical) HLA class I, class II and proteasomal genes. Results: We generated the first comprehensive expression atlas of antigen presenting-related genes across 56 normal tissues and cell types, including immune cells, pancreatic islets, platelets and hematopoietic stem cells. We found a surprisingly heterogeneous HLA expression pattern with up to 100-fold difference in intra-tissue median HLA abundances. Cells of the immune system and lymphatic organs expressed the highest levels of classical HLA class I (HLA-A,-B,-C), class II (HLA-DQA1,-DQB1,-DPA1,-DPB1,-DRA,-DRB1) and non-classical HLA class I (HLA-E,-F) molecules, whereas retina, brain, muscle, megakaryocytes and erythroblasts showed the lowest abundance. In contrast, we identified a distinct and highly tissue-restricted expression pattern of the non-classical class I gene HLA-G in placenta, pancreatic islets, pituitary gland and testis. While the constitutive proteasome showed relatively constant expression across all tissues, we found the immunoproteasome to be enriched in lymphatic organs and almost absent in immune privileged tissues. Conclusions: Here, we not only provide a reference catalog of tissue and cell type specific HLA expression, but also highlight extremely variable expression of the basic components of antigen processing and presentation in different cell types. Our findings indicate that low expression of classical HLA class I molecules together with lack of immunoproteasome components as well as upregulation of HLA-G may be of key relevance to maintain tolerance in immune privileged tissues.

AB  - Complex behavioral traits, such as alcohol abuse, are caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors, producing deleterious functional adaptations in the central nervous system. The long-term behavioral consequences of such changes are of substantial cost to both the individual and society. Substantial progress has been made in the last two decades in understanding elements of brain mechanisms underlying responses to ethanol in animal models and risk factors for alcohol use disorder(AUD) in humans. However, treatments for AUD remain largely ineffective and few medications for this disease state have been licensed. Genome-wide genetic polymorphism analysis(GWAS) in humans, behavioral genetic studies in animal models and brain gene expression studies produced by microarrays or RNA-seq have the potential to produce nonbiased and novel insight into the underlying neurobiology of AUD. However, the complexity of such information, both statistical and informational, has slowed progress toward identifying new targets for intervention in AUD. This chapter describes one approach for integrating behavioral, genetic, and genomic information across animal model and human studies. The goal of this approach is to identify networks of genes functioning in the brain that are most relevant to the underlying mechanisms of a complex disease such as AUD. We illustrate an example of how genomic studies in animal models can be used to produce robust gene networks that have functional implications, and to integrate such animal model genomic data with human genetic studies such as GWAS for AUD. We describe several useful analysis tools for such studies: ComBAT, WGCNA, and EW_dmGWAS. The end result of this analysis is a ranking of gene networks and identification of their cognate hub genes, which might provide eventual targets for future therapeutic development. Furthermore, this combined approach may also improve our understanding of basic mechanisms underlying gene x environmental interactions affecting brain functioning in health and disease.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing has triggered an explosion of available genomic and transcriptomic resources in the plant sciences. Although genome and transcriptome sequencing has become orders of magnitudes cheaper and more efficient, often the functional annotation process is lagging behind. This might be hampered by the lack of a comprehensive enumeration of simple-to-use tools available to the plant researcher. In this comprehensive review, we present (i) typical ontologies to be used in the plant sciences, (ii) useful databases and resources used for functional annotation, (iii) what to expect from an annotated plant genome, (iv) an automated annotation pipeline and (v) a recipe and reference chart outlining typical steps used to annotate plant genomes/transcriptomes using publicly available resources.

AB  - Dysregulation of splicing is a common factor underlying many inherited diseases including deafness. For one deafness-associated gene, DFNA5, perturbation of exon 8 splicing results in a constitutively active truncated protein. To date, only intronic mutations have been reported to cause exon 8 skipping in patients with DFNA5-related deafness. In five families with postlingual progressive autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss, we employed two next-generation sequencing platforms-OtoSCOPE and whole exome sequencing-followed by variant filtering and prioritization based on both minor allele frequency and functional consequence using a customized bioinformatics pipeline to identify three novel and two recurrent mutations in DFNA5 that segregated with hearing loss in these families. The three novel mutations are all missense variants within exon 8 that are predicted computationally to decrease splicing efficiency or abolish it completely. We confirmed their functional impact in vitro using mini-genes carrying each mutant DFNA5 exon 8. In so doing, we present the first exonic mutations in DFNA5 to cause deafness, expand the mutational spectrum of DFNA5-related hearing loss, and highlight the importance of assessing the effect of coding variants on splicing.

AB  - We developed an RNA-sequencing-based pipeline to discover differentially expressed cell-surface molecules in neuroblastoma that meet criteria for optimal immunotherapeutic target safety and efficacy. Here, we show that GPC2 is a strong candidate immunotherapeutic target in this childhood cancer. We demonstrate high GPC2 expression in neuroblastoma due to MYCN transcriptional activation and/or somatic gain of the GPC2 locus. We confirm GPC2 to be highly expressed on most neuroblastomas, but not detectable at appreciable levels in normal childhood tissues. In addition, we demonstrate that GPC2 is required for neuroblastoma proliferation. Finally, we develop a GPC2-directed antibody-drug conjugate that is potently cytotoxic to GPC2-expressing neuroblastoma cells. Collectively, these findings validate GPC2 as a non-mutated neuroblastoma oncoprotein and candidate immunotherapeutic target.

AB  - The main goals of this project are: (i) to improve the reliability of RNA sequencing on Illumina platforms; (ii) to develop a new, more sensitive, experimental pipeline for sequencing single bacterial cells; (iii) and, finally, to explore the individual transcriptome of isogenic cells. Currently used techniques need a large number of bacterial cells for one sequencing run. Hence, to reach single-cell resolution new library preparation approaches and amplification schemes are required, which will be developed and validated. In addition, coding theoretic methods (barcodes) need to be applied to reduce the inevitable technical variability of the sequencing process. In particular, we will develop barcodes to improve multiplexing and to reduce the amplification noise, which otherwise will hide the biological variability in the number of mRNAs in cells. This will also require to establish a comprehensive channel model of RNA-seq using statistical analysis and suitable experiments. The new established sequencing procedure will then be used to explore the stochastic cell-to-cell variability of transcriptomic profiles. We are especially interested in the phenomena of stochastic cell-state switching, which has not yet been studied on a genome-wide scale, and to explore basic mechanisms of transcription events, e.g., the mechanisms causing transcriptional bursts.

AB  - BackgroundPrioritization of variants in personal genomic data is a major challenge. Recently, computational methods that rely on comparing phenotype similarity have shown to be useful to identify causative variants. In these methods, pathogenicity prediction is combined with a semantic similarity measure to prioritize not only variants that are likely to be dysfunctional but those that are likely involved in the pathogenesis of a patient's phenotype.ResultsWe have developed DeepPVP, a variant prioritization method that combined automated inference with deep neural networks to identify the likely causative variants in whole exome or whole genome sequence data. We demonstrate that DeepPVP performs significantly better than existing methods, including phenotype-based methods that use similar features. DeepPVP is freely available at https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/phenomenet-vp.Conclusions DeepPVP further improves on existing variant prioritization methods both in terms of speed as well as accuracy.

AB  - The human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus expresses a set of transcriptional factors and small RNAs (sRNAs) to adapt to environmental variations. Recent harmonization of staphylococcal sRNA data allowed us to search for novel sRNAs using DETR'PROK, a computational pipeline for identifying sRNA in prokaryotes. We performed RNA-Seq on Newman strain and identified a set of 48 sRNA candidates. To avoid bioinformatic artefacts, we applied a series of cut-offs and tested experimentally each selected intergenic region. This narrowed the field to 24 expressed sRNAs, of which 21 were new and designated with Srn identifiers. Further examination of these loci revealed that one exhibited an unusual condensed sRNA cluster of about 650 nucleotides. We determined the transcriptional start sites within this region and demonstrated the presence of three contiguous sRNA genes (srn_9342, srn_9344 and srn_9345) expressed from the positive strand, and two others ( srn_9343 and srn_9346) transcribed from the opposite one. Using comparative genomics, we showed that genetic organization of the srn_93429346 locus is specific to Newman and that its expression is growth-phase dependent and subjected to nutrient deprivation and oxidative stress. Finally, we demonstrated that srn_9343 encodes a secreted peptide that could belong to a novel S. aureus toxin-antitoxin system.

AB  - Genetic association mapping produces statistical links between phenotypes and genomic regions, but identifying causal variants remains difficult. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can help by providing complete knowledge of all genetic variants, but it is financially prohibitive for well-powered GWAS studies. We performed mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with WGS and RNA-seq, and found that lead eQTL variants called with WGS were more likely to be causal. Through simulations, we derived properties of causal variants and used them to develop a method for identifying likely causal SNPs. We estimated that 25-70% of causal variants were located in open-chromatin regions, depending on the tissue and experiment. Finally, we identified a set of high-confidence causal variants and showed that these were more enriched in GWAS associations than other eQTLs. Of those, we found 65 associations with GWAS traits and provide examples in which genes implicated by expression are functionally validated as being relevant for complex traits.

AB  - Technological advances promise unprecedented opportunities for whole exome sequencing and proteomic analyses of populations. Currently, data from genome and exome sequencing or proteomic studies are searched against reference genome annotations. This provides the foundation for research and clinical screening for genetic causes of pathologies. However, current genome annotations substantially underestimate the proteomic information encoded within a gene. Numerous studies have now demonstrated the expression and function of alternative (mainly small, sometimes overlapping) ORFs within mature gene transcripts. This has important consequences for the correlation of phenotypes and genotypes. Most alternative ORFs are not yet annotated because of a lack of evidence, and this absence from databases precludes their detection by standard proteomic methods, such as mass spectrometry. Here, we demonstrate how current approaches tend to overlook alternative ORFs, hindering the discovery of new genetic drivers and fundamental research. We discuss available tools and techniques to improve identification of proteins from alternative ORFs and finally suggest a novel annotation system to permit a more complete representation of the transcriptomic and proteomic information contained within a gene. Given the crucial challenge of distinguishing functional ORFs from random ones, the suggested pipeline emphasizes both experimental data and conservation signatures. The addition of alternative ORFs in databases will render identification less serendipitous and advance the pace of research and genomic knowledge. This review highlights the urgent medical and research need to incorporate alternative ORFs in current genome annotations and thus permit their inclusion in hypotheses and models, which relate phenotypes and genotypes.

AB  - Background: A single bout of exercise induces changes in gene expression in skeletal muscle. Regular exercise results in an adaptive response involving changes in muscle architecture and biochemistry, and is an effective way to manage and prevent common human diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disorders and type II diabetes. However, the biomolecular mechanisms underlying such responses still need to be fully elucidated. Here we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of skeletal muscle tissue in a large cohort of untrained Thoroughbred horses (n = 51) before and after a bout of high-intensity exercise and again after an extended period of training. We hypothesized that regular high-intensity exercise training primes the transcriptome for the demands of high-intensity exercise. Results: An extensive set of genes was observed to be significantly differentially regulated in response to a single bout of high-intensity exercise in the untrained cohort (3241 genes) and following multiple bouts of high-intensity exercise training over a six-month period (3405 genes). Approximately one-third of these genes (1025) and several biological processes related to energy metabolism were common to both the exercise and training responses. We then developed a novel network-based computational analysis pipeline to test the hypothesis that these transcriptional changes also influence the contextual molecular interactome and its dynamics in response to exercise and training. The contextual network analysis identified several important hub genes, including the autophagosomal-related gene GABARAPL1, and dynamic functional modules, including those enriched for mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and V, that were differentially regulated and had their putative interactions 're-wired' in the exercise and/or training responses. Conclusion: Here we have generated for the first time, a comprehensive set of genes that are differentially expressed in Thoroughbred skeletal muscle in response to both exercise and training. These data indicate that consecutive bouts of high-intensity exercise result in a priming of the skeletal muscle transcriptome for the demands of the next exercise bout. Furthermore, this may also lead to an extensive 're-wiring' of the molecular interactome in both exercise and training and include key genes and functional modules related to autophagy and the mitochondrion.

AB  - Advances in sequencing have facilitated nucleotide-resolution genome-wide transcriptomic profiles across multiple mouse eye tissues. However, these RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) based eye developmental transcriptomes are not organized for easy public access, making any further analysis challenging. Here, we present a new database "Express" (http://www.iupui.edu/similar to sysbio/express/) that unifies various mouse lens and retina RNA-seq data and provides user-friendly visualization of the transcriptome to facilitate gene discovery in the eye. We obtained RNA-seq data encompassing 7 developmental stages of lens in addition to that on isolated lens epithelial and fibers, as well as on 11 developmental stages of retina/isolated retinal rod photoreceptor cells from publicly available wild-type mouse datasets. These datasets were pre-processed, aligned, quantified and normalized for expression levels of known and novel transcripts using a unified expression quantification framework. Express provides heatmap and browser view allowing easy navigation of the genomic organization of transcripts or gene loci. Further, it allows users to search candidate genes and export both the visualizations and the embedded data to facilitate downstream analysis. We identified total of > 81,000 transcripts in the lens and > 178,000 transcripts in the retina across all the included developmental stages. This analysis revealed that a significant number of the retina-expressed transcripts are novel. Expression of several transcripts in the lens and retina across multiple developmental stages was independently validated by RT-qPCR for established genes such as Pax6 and Lhx2 as well as for new candidates such as Elavl4, RbmS, Pabpc1, Tia1 and Tubb2b. Thus, Express serves as an effective portal for analyzing pruned RNA-seq expression datasets presently collected for the lens and retina. It will allow a wild-type context for the detailed analysis of targeted gene-knockout mouse ocular defect models and facilitate the prioritization of candidate genes from Exome-seq data of eye disease patients.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and have been targeted as indicators of environmental/toxicologic stressors. Using the data from our deep sequencing of miRNAs in an extensive sampling of rat tissues, we developed a database called RATEmiRs for the Rat Atlas of Tissue-specific and Enriched miRNAs to allow users to dynamically determine mature-, iso- and pre-miR expression abundance, enrichment and specificity in rat tissues and organs. Illumina sequencing count data from mapped reads and meta data from the miRNA body atlas consisting of 21 and 23 tissues (14 organs) of toxicologic interest from 12 to 13 week old male and female Sprague Dawley rats respectively, were managed in a relational database with a user-friendly query interface. Data-driven pipelines are available to tailor the identification of tissue-enriched (TE) and tissue-specific (TS) miRNAs. Data-driven organ-specific (OS) pipelines reveal miRNAs that are expressed predominately in a given organ. A user-driven approach is also available to assess the tissue expression of user-specified miRNAs. Using one tissue vs other tissues and tissue(s) of an organ vs other organs, we illustrate the utility of RATEmiRs to facilitate the identification of candidate miRNAs. As a use case example, RATEmiRs revealed two TS miRNAs in the liver: rno-miR-122-3p and rno-miR-122-5p. When liver is compared to just the brain tissues for example, rno-miR-192-5p, rno-miR-193-3p, rno-miR-203b-3p, rno-miR-3559-5p, rno-miR-802-3p and rno-miR-802-5p are also detected as abundantly expressed in liver. As another example, 55 miRNAs from the RATEmiRs query of ileum vs brain tissues overlapped with miRNAs identified from the same comparison of tissues in an independent, publicly available dataset of 10 week old male rat microarray data suggesting that these miRNAs are likely not age-specific, platform-specific nor pipeline-dependent. Lastly, we identified 10 miRNAs that have conserved tissue/organ-specific expression between the rat and human species. RATEmiRs provides a new platform for identification of TE, TS and OS miRNAs in a broad array of rat tissues. RATEmiRs is available at: https://www.niehs.nih.gov/ratemirs

Even if their results are of good quality it is still possible to improve them in several ways including redundancy reduction or error correction. Trinity and Oases are two commonly used de novo transcriptome assemblers. The contig sets they produce are of good quality.Still, their compaction (number of contigs needed to represent the transcriptome) and their quality (chimera and nucleotide error rates) can be improved. Results. We built a de novo RNA-Seq Assembly Pipeline (DRAP) which wraps these two assemblers (Trinity and Oases) in order to improve their results regarding the above-mentioned criteria. DRAP reduces from 1.3 to 15 fold the number of resulting contigs of the assemblies depending on the read set and the assembler used. This article presents seven assembly comparisons showing in some cases drastic improvements when using DRAP. DRAP does not significantly impair assembly quality metrics such are read realignment rate or protein reconstruction counts. Conclusion.Transcriptome assembly is a challenging computational task even if good solutions are already available to end-users, these solutions can still be improved while conserving the overall representation and quality of the assembly. The de novo RNA-Seq Assembly Pipeline (DRAP) is an easy to use software package to produce compact and corrected transcript set.

AB  - Previous studies have prioritized trait-relevant cell types by looking for an enrichment of genome-wide association study (GWAS) signal within functional regions. However, these studies are limited in cell resolution by the lack of functional annotations from difficult-tocharacterize or rare cell populations. Measurement of single-cell gene expression has become a popular method for characterizing novel cell types, and yet limited work has linked single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to phenotypes of interest. To address this deficiency, we present RolyPoly, a regression-based polygenic model that can prioritize trait-relevant cell types and genes from GWAS summary statistics and gene expression data. RolyPoly is designed to use expression data from either bulk tissue or single-cell RNA-seq. In this study, we demonstrated RolyPoly's accuracy through simulation and validated previously known tissue-trait associations. We discovered a significant association between microglia and late-onset Alzheimer disease and an association between schizophrenia and oligodendrocytes and replicating fetal cortical cells. Additionally, RolyPoly computes a trait-relevance score for each gene to reflect the importance of expression specific to a cell type. We found that differentially expressed genes in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with Alzheimer disease were significantly enriched with genes ranked highly by RolyPoly gene scores. Overall, our method represents a powerful framework for understanding the effect of common variants on cell types contributing to complex traits.

AB  - Background: Patient-Derived Tumour Xenografts (PDTXs) have emerged as the pre-clinical models that best represent clinical tumour diversity and intra-tumour heterogeneity. The molecular characterization of PDTXs using High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) is essential; however, the presence of mouse stroma is challenging for HTS data analysis. Indeed, the high homology between the two genomes results in a proportion of mouse reads being mapped as human. Results: In this study we generated Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from samples with known mixtures of mouse and human DNA or RNA and from a cohort of human breast cancers and their derived PDTXs. We show that using an In silico Combined human-mouse Reference Genome (ICRG) for alignment discriminates between human and mouse reads with up to 99.9% accuracy and decreases the number of false positive somatic mutations caused by misalignment by > 99.9%. We also derived a model to estimate the human DNA content in independent PDTX samples. For RNA-seq and RRBS data analysis, the use of the ICRG allows dissecting computationally the transcriptome and methylome of human tumour cells and mouse stroma. In a direct comparison with previously reported approaches, our method showed similar or higher accuracy while requiring significantly less computing time. Conclusions: The computational pipeline we describe here is a valuable tool for the molecular analysis of PDTXs as well as any other mixture of DNA or RNA species.

AB  - Background: Soft tissue and bone sarcoma represent a broad spectrum of different pathology and genetic variance. Current chemotherapy regimens are derived from randomised trials and represent empirical treatment. Chemosensitivity testing and whole exome sequencing (WES) may offer personalized chemotherapy treatment based on genetic mutations. Methods: A pilot, prospective, non-randomised control experimental study was conducted. Twelve patients with metastatic bone or soft tissue sarcoma that had failed first line chemotherapy treatment were enrolled for this study. Human tissue taken at surgical biopsy under general anaesthetic was divided between two arms of the trial. Subsections of the tumour were used for WES and the remainder was implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice (PDX). Results of WES were analysed using a bioinformatics pipeline to identify mutations conferring susceptibility to kinase inhibitors and common chemotherapeutic agents. PDX models exhibiting successful growth underwent WES of the tumour and subsequent chemosensitivity testing. Results: WES was successful in all 12 patients, with successful establishment PDX tumours models in seven patients. WES identified potential actionable therapeutics in all patients. Significant variation in predicted therapeutics was demonstrated between three PDX samples and their matched tumour samples. Conclusion: Analysis of WES of fresh tumour specimens via a bioinformatics pipeline may identify potential actionable chemotherapy agents. Further research into this field may lead to the development of personalized cancer therapy for sarcoma.

AB  - SF-1/NR5A1 is a transcriptional regulator of adrenal and gonadal development. NR5A1 disease-causing variants cause disorders of sex development (DSD) and adrenal failure, but most affected individuals show a broad DSD/reproductive phenotype only. Most NR5A1 variants show in vitro pathogenic effects, but not when tested in heterozygote state together with wild-type NR5A1 as usually seen in patients. Thus, the genotype-phenotype correlation for NR5A1 variants remains an unsolved question. We analyzed heterozygous 46,XY SF-1/NR5A1 patients by whole exome sequencing and used an algorithm for data analysis based on selected project-specific DSD- and SF-1-related genes. The variants detected were evaluated for their significance in literature, databases and checked in silico using webtools. We identified 19 potentially deleterious variants (one to seven per patient) in 18 genes in four 46, XY DSD subjects carrying heterozygous NR5A1 disease-causing variants. We constructed a scheme of all these hits within the landscape of currently known genes involved in male sex determination and differentiation. Our results suggest that the broad phenotype in these heterozygous NR5A1 46, XY DSD subjects may well be explained by an oligogenic mode of inheritance, in which multiple hits, individually non-deleterious, may contribute to a DSD phenotype unique to each heterozygous SF-1/NR5A1 individual.

AB  - Recent developments in microfluidic devices, nanoparticle chemistry, fluorescent microscopy, and biochemical techniques such as genetic identification and antibody capture have provided easier and more sensitive platforms for detecting and diagnosing diseases as well as providing new fundamental insight into disease progression. These advancements have led to the development of new technology and assays capable of easy and early detection of pathogenicity as well as the enhancement of the drug discovery and development pipeline. While some studies have focused on treatment, many of these technologies have found initial success in laboratories as a precursor for clinical applications. This review highlights the current and future progress of microfluidic techniques geared toward the timely and inexpensive diagnosis of disease including technologies aimed at high-throughput single cell analysis for drug development. It also summarizes novel microfluidic approaches to characterize fundamental cellular behavior and heterogeneity.

AB  - Motivation: Pseudotime analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data have become increasingly common. Typically, a latent trajectory corresponding to a biological process of interest-such as differentiation or cell cycle-is discovered. However, relatively little attention has been paid to modelling the differential expression of genes along such trajectories. Results: We present switchde, a statistical framework and accompanying R package for identifying switch-like differential expression of genes along pseudotemporal trajectories. Our method includes fast model fitting that provides interpretable parameter estimates corresponding to how quickly a gene is up or down regulated as well as where in the trajectory such regulation occurs. It also reports a P-value in favour of rejecting a constant-expression model for switch-like differential expression and optionally models the zero-inflation prevalent in single-cell data. Availability and Implementation: The R package switchde is available through the Bioconductor project at https://bioconductor.org/packages/switchde.

AB  - We have developed a virus detection and discovery computational pipeline, Pickaxe, and applied it to NGS databases provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We analyzed a collection of whole genome (WGS), exome (WXS), and RNA (RNA-Seq) sequencing libraries from 3052 participants across 22 different cancers. NGS data from nearly all tumor and normal tissues examined contained contaminating viral sequences. Intensive computational and manual efforts are required to remove these artifacts. We found that several different types of cancers harbored Herpesviruses including EBV, CMV, HHV1, HHV2, HHV6 and HHV7. In addition to the reported associations of Hepatitis B and C virus (HBV & HCV) with liver cancer, and Human papillomaviruses (HPV) with cervical cancer and a subset of head and neck cancers, we found additional cases of HPV integrated in a small number of bladder cancers. Gene expression and mutational profiles suggest that HPV drives tumorigenesis in these cases.

AB  - Metavisitor is a software package that allows biologists and clinicians without specialized bioinformatics expertise to detect and assemble viral genomes from deep sequence datasets. The package is composed of a set of modular bioinformatic tools and workflows that are implemented in the Galaxy framework. Using the graphical Galaxy workflow editor, users with minimal computational skills can use existing Metavisitor workflows or adapt them to suit specific needs by adding or modifying analysis modules. Metavisitor works with DNA, RNA or small RNA sequencing data over a range of read lengths and can use a combination of de novo and guided approaches to assemble genomes from sequencing reads. We show that the software has the potential for quick diagnosis as well as discovery of viruses from a vast array of organisms. Importantly, we provide here executable Metavisitor use cases, which increase the accessibility and transparency of the software, ultimately enabling biologists or clinicians to focus on biological or medical questions.

AB  - With more than 500,000 copies, mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs), a sub-group of SINEs, represent similar to 2.5% of the human genome and one of the most numerous family of potential targets for the RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcription machinery. Since MIR elements ceased to amplify similar to 130 myr ago, previous studies primarily focused on their genomic impact, while the issue of their expression has not been extensively addressed. We applied a dedicated bioinformatic pipeline to ENCODE RNA-Seq datasets of seven human cell lines and, for the first time, we were able to define the Pol III-driven MIR transcriptome at single-locus resolution. While the majority of Pol III-transcribed MIR elements are cell-specific, we discovered a small set of ubiquitously transcribed MIRs mapping within Pol II-transcribed genes in antisense orientation that could influence the expression of the overlapping gene. We also identified novel Pol III-transcribed ncRNAs, deriving from transcription of annotated MIR fragments flanked by unique MIR-unrelated sequences, and confirmed the role of Pol III-specific internal promoter elements in MIR transcription. Besides demonstrating widespread transcription at these retrotranspositionally inactive elements in human cells, the ability to profile MIR expression at single-locus resolution will facilitate their study in different cell types and states including pathological alterations.

AB  - Background: Salmonid fishes exhibit high levels of phenotypic and ecological variation and are thus ideal model systems for studying evolutionary processes of adaptive divergence and speciation. Furthermore, salmonids are of major interest in fisheries, aquaculture, and conservation research. Improving understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying traits in these species would significantly progress research in these fields. Here we generate high quality de novo transcriptomes for four salmonid species: Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brown trout (Salmo trutta), Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), and European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). All species except Atlantic salmon have no reference genome publicly available and few if any genomic studies to date. Results: We used paired-end RNA-seq on Illumina to generate high coverage sequencing of multiple individuals, yielding between 180 and 210 M reads per species. After initial assembly, strict filtering was used to remove duplicated, redundant, and low confidence transcripts. The final assemblies consisted of 36,505 protein-coding transcripts for Atlantic salmon, 35,736 for brown trout, 33,126 for Arctic charr, and 33,697 for European whitefish and are made publicly available. Assembly completeness was assessed using three approaches, all of which supported high quality of the assemblies: 1) similar to 78% of Actinopterygian single-copy orthologs were successfully captured in our assemblies, 2) orthogroup inference identified high overlap in the protein sequences present across all four species (40% shared across all four and 84% shared by at least two), and 3) comparison with the published Atlantic salmon genome suggests that our assemblies represent well covered (similar to 98%) protein-coding transcriptomes. Thorough comparison of the generated assemblies found that 84-90% of transcripts in each assembly were orthologous with at least one of the other three species. We also identified 34-37% of transcripts in each assembly as paralogs. We further compare completeness and annotation statistics of our new assemblies to available related species. Conclusion: New, high-confidence protein-coding transcriptomes were generated for four ecologically and economically important species of salmonids. This offers a high quality pipeline for such complex genomes, represents a valuable contribution to the existing genomic resources for these species and provides robust tools for future investigation of gene expression and sequence evolution in these and other salmonid species.

AB  - Background: Nowadays, many public repositories containing large microarray gene expression datasets are available. However, the problem lies in the fact that microarray technology are less powerful and accurate than more recent Next Generation Sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq. In any case, information from microarrays is truthful and robust, thus it can be exploited through the integration of microarray data with RNA-Seq data. Additionally, information extraction and acquisition of large number of samples in RNA-Seq still entails very high costs in terms of time and computational resources. This paper proposes a new model to find the gene signature of breast cancer cell lines through the integration of heterogeneous data from different breast cancer datasets, obtained from microarray and RNA-Seq technologies. Consequently, data integration is expected to provide a more robust statistical significance to the results obtained. Finally, a classification method is proposed in order to test the robustness of the Differentially Expressed Genes when unseen data is presented for diagnosis. Results: The proposed data integration allows analyzing gene expression samples coming from different technologies. The most significant genes of the whole integrated data were obtained through the intersection of the three gene sets, corresponding to the identified expressed genes within the microarray data itself, within the RNA-Seq data itself, and within the integrated data from both technologies. This intersection reveals 98 possible technology-independent biomarkers. Two different heterogeneous datasets were distinguished for the classification tasks: a training dataset for gene expression identification and classifier validation, and a test dataset with unseen data for testing the classifier. Both of them achieved great classification accuracies, therefore confirming the validity of the obtained set of genes as possible biomarkers for breast cancer. Through a feature selection process, a final small subset made up by six genes was considered for breast cancer diagnosis. Conclusions: This work proposes a novel data integration stage in the traditional gene expression analysis pipeline through the combination of heterogeneous data from microarrays and RNA-Seq technologies. Available samples have been successfully classified using a subset of six genes obtained by a feature selection method. Consequently, a new classification and diagnosis tool was built and its performance was validated using previously unseen samples.

AB  - Ciliopathies are a group of rare disorders characterized by a high genetic and phenotypic variability, which complicates their molecular diagnosis. Hence the need to use the latest powerful approaches to faster identify the genetic defect in these patients. We applied whole exome sequencing to six consanguineous families clinically diagnosed with ciliopathy- like disease, and for which mutations in predominant Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) genes had previously been excluded. Our strategy, based on first applying several filters to ciliary variants and using many of the bioinformatics tools available, allowed us to identify causal mutations in BBS2, ALMS1 and CRB1 genes in four families, thus confirming the molecular diagnosis of ciliopathy. In the remaining two families, after first rejecting the presence of pathogenic variants in common cilia-related genes, we adopted a new filtering strategy combined with prioritisation tools to rank the final candidate genes for each case. Thus, we propose CORO2B, LMO7 and ZNF17 as novel candidate ciliary genes, but further functional studies will be needed to confirm their role. Our data show the usefulness of this strategy to diagnose patients with unclear phenotypes, and therefore the success of applying such technologies to achieve a rapid and reliable molecular diagnosis, improving genetic counselling for these patients. In addition, the described pipeline also highlights the common pitfalls associated to the large volume of data we have to face and the difficulty of assigning a functional role to these changes, hence the importance of designing the most appropriate strategy according to each case.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing is empowering genetic disease research. However, it also brings significant challenges for efficient and effective sequencing data analysis. We built a pipeline, called DNAp, for analyzing whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, to detect mutations from disease samples. The pipeline is containerized, convenient to use and can run under any system, since it is a fully automatic process in Docker container form. It is also open, and can be easily customized with user intervention points, such as for updating reference files and different software or versions. The pipeline has been tested with both human and mouse sequencing datasets, and it has generated mutations results, comparable to published results from these datasets, and reproducible across heterogeneous hardware platforms. The pipeline DNAp, funded by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was developed for analyzing DNA sequencing data of FDA. Here we make DNAp an open source, with the software and documentation available to the public at http://bioinformatics.astate.edu/dna-pipeline/.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The molecular mechanisms underlying aggressive versus indolent disease are not fully understood. Recent research has implicated a class of molecules known as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumorigenesis and progression of cancer. Our objective was to discover lncRNAs that differentiate aggressive and indolent prostate cancers. METHODS: Weanalyzed paired tumor and normal tissues from six aggressive Gleason score (GS) 8-10 and six indolent GS 6 prostate cancers. Extracted RNA was split for poly(A)+ and ribosomal RNA depletion library preparations, followed by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) using an Illumina HiSeq 2000. We developed an RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline to discover and quantify these molecules. Candidate lncRNAs were validated using RT-qPCR on 87 tumor tissue samples: 28 (GS 6), 28 (GS 3+4), 6 (GS 4+3), and 25 (GS 8-10). Statistical correlations between lncRNAs and clinicopathologic variables were tested using ANOVA. RESULTS: The 43 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs between aggressive and indolent prostate cancers included 12 annotated and 31 novel lncRNAs. The top six DE lncRNAs were selected based on large, consistent fold-changes in the RNA-Seq results. Three of these candidates passed RT-qPCR validation, including AC009014.3 (P < .001 in tumor tissue) and a newly discovered X-linked lncRNA named XPLAID (P = .049 in tumor tissue and P = .048 in normal tissue). XPLAID and AC009014.3 show promise as prognostic biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered several dozen lncRNAs that distinguish aggressive and indolent prostate cancers, of which four were validated using RT-qPCR. The investigation into their biology is ongoing.

AB  - Proteogenomics has emerged as a valuable approach in cancer research, which integrates genomic and transcriptomic data with mass spectrometry-based proteomics data to directly identify expressed, variant protein sequences that may have functional roles in cancer. This approach is computationally intensive, requiring integration of disparate software tools into sophisticated workflows, challenging its adoption by nonexpert, bench scientists. To address this need, we have developed an extensible, Galaxy-based resource aimed at providing more researchers access to, and training in, proteogenomic informatics. Our resource brings together software from several leading research groups to address two foundational aspects of proteogenomics: (i) generation of customized, annotated protein sequence databases from RNA-Seq data; and (ii) accurate matching of tandem mass spectrometry data to putative variants, followed by filtering to confirm their novelty. Directions for accessing software tools and workflows, along with instructional documentation, can be found at z.umn.edu/canresgithub. (C) 2017 AACR.

AB  - Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq, currently dominate genome-wide gene expression studies. A standard approach to analyse this data requires mapping sequence reads to a reference and counting the number of reads which map to each gene. However, for many transcriptome studies, a suitable reference genome is unavailable, especially for meta-transcriptome studies which assay gene expression from mixed populations of organisms. Where a reference is unavailable, it is possible to generate a reference by the de novo assembly of the sequence reads. However, the high cost of generating high-coverage data for de novo assembly hinders this approach and more importantly the accurate assembly of such data is challenging, especially for meta-transcriptome data, and resulting assemblies frequently suffer from collapsed regions or chimeric sequences. As an alternative to the standard reference mapping approach, we have developed a k-mer-based analysis pipeline (DiffKAP) to identify differentially expressed reads between RNA-Seq datasets without the requirement for a reference. We compared the DiffKAP approach with the traditional Tophat/Cuffdiff method using RNA-Seq data from soybean, which has a suitable reference genome. We subsequently examined differential gene expression for a coral meta-transcriptome where no reference is available, and validated the results using qRT-PCR. We conclude that DiffKAP is an accurate method to study differential gene expression in complex meta-transcriptomes without the requirement of a reference genome.

AB  - Background: Gene prediction is one of the most important steps in the genome annotation process. A large number of software tools and pipelines developed by various computing techniques are available for gene prediction. However, these systems have yet to accurately predict all or even most of the protein-coding regions. Furthermore, none of the currently available gene-finders has a universal Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that can perform gene prediction for all organisms equally well in an automatic fashion. Results: We present an automated gene prediction pipeline, Seqping that uses self-training HMM models and transcriptomic data. The pipeline processes the genome and transcriptome sequences of the target species using GlimmerHMM, SNAP, and AUGUSTUS pipelines, followed by MAKER2 program to combine predictions from the three tools in association with the transcriptomic evidence. Seqping generates species-specific HMMs that are able to offer unbiased gene predictions. The pipeline was evaluated using the Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana genomes. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis showed that the pipeline was able to identify at least 95% of BUSCO's plantae dataset. Our evaluation shows that Seqping was able to generate better gene predictions compared to three HMM-based programs (MAKER2, GlimmerHMM and AUGUSTUS) using their respective available HMMs. Seqping had the highest accuracy in rice (0.5648 for CDS, 0.4468 for exon, and 0.6695 nucleotide structure) and A. thaliana (0.5808 for CDS, 0.5955 for exon, and 0.8839 nucleotide structure). Conclusions: Seqping provides researchers a seamless pipeline to train species-specific HMMs and predict genes in newly sequenced or less-studied genomes. We conclude that the Seqping pipeline predictions are more accurate than gene predictions using the other three approaches with the default or available HMMs.

AB  - Background: MYO15A variants, except those in the N-terminal domain, have been shown to be associated with congenital or pre-lingual severe-to-profound hearing loss (DFNB3), which ultimately requires cochlear implantation in early childhood. Recently, such variants have also been shown to possibly cause moderate-to-severe hearing loss. Herein, we also demonstrate that some MYO15A mutant alleles can cause postlingual onset of progressive partial deafness. Methods: Two multiplex Korean families (SB246 and SB224), manifesting postlingual, progressive, partial deafness in an autosomal recessive fashion, were recruited. Molecular genetics testing was performed in two different pipelines, in a parallel fashion, for the SB246 family: targeted exome sequencing (TES) of 129 known deafness genes from the proband and whole exome sequencing (WES) of all affected subjects. Only the former pipeline was performed for the SB224 family. Rigorous bioinformatics analyses encompassing structural variations were executed to investigate any causative variants. Results: In the SB246 family, two different molecular diagnostic pipelines provided exactly the same candidate variants: c.5504G > A (p.R1835H) in the motor domain and c.10245_10247delCTC (p.S3417del) in the FERM domain of MYO15A. In the SB224 family, c.9790C > T (p.Q3264X) and c.10263C > G (p.I3421M) in the FERM domain were detected as candidate variants. Conclusions: Some recessive MYO15A variants can cause postlingual onset of progressive partial deafness. The phenotypic spectrum of DFNB3 should be extended to include such partial deafness. The mechanism for a milder phenotype could be due to the milder pathogenic potential from hypomorphic alleles of MYO15A or the presence of modifier genes. This merits further investigation.

AB  - Proper control of microRNA (miRNA) expression is critical for normal development and physiology, while abnormal miRNA expression is a common feature of many diseases. Dissecting mechanisms of miRNA regulation, however, is complicated by the generally poor annotation of miRNA primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). Although some miRNAs are processed from well-defined protein coding genes, the majority of pri-miRNAs are poorly characterized noncoding RNAs, with incomplete annotation of promoters, splice sites, and polyadenylation signals. Due to the efficiency of DROSHA processing, the abundance of pri-miRNAs is very low at steady state, thereby complicating the elucidation of pri-miRNA structures. Here we describe a strategy to enrich intact pri-miRNAs and improve their coverage in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments. In addition, we outline a computational approach for reconstruction of pri-miRNA structures. This pipeline begins with raw RNA-seq reads and concludes with publication-ready visualization of pri-miRNA annotations. Together, these approaches allow the user to define and explore miRNA gene structures in a cell-type or organism of interest.

AB  - Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important in various biological processes, but very few studies on lncRNA have been conducted in birds. To identify IncRNAs expressed during feather development, we analyzed single-stranded RNA-seq (ssRNA-seq) data from the anterior and posterior dorsal regions during zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) embryonic development. Using published transcriptomic data, we further analyzed the evolutionary conservation of IncRNAs in birds and amniotes. Results: A total of 1,081 lncRNAs, including 965 intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), 59 intronic lncRNAs, and 57 antisense lncRNAs (lncNATs), were identified using our newly developed pipeline. These avian IncRNAs share similar characteristics with lncRNAs in mammals, such as shorter transcript length, lower exon number, lower average expression level and less sequence conservation than mRNAs. However, the proportion of lncRNAs overlapping with transposable elements in birds is much lower than that in mammals. We predicted the functions of IncRNAs based on the enriched functions of co-expressed protein-coding genes. Clusters of lncRNAs associated with natal down development were identified. The sequences and expression levels of candidate lncRNAs that shared conserved sequences among birds were validated by qPCR in both zebra finch and chicken. Finally, we identified three highly conserved lncRNAs that may be associated with natal down development. Conclusions: Our study provides the first systematical identification of avian lncRNAs using ssRNA-seq analysis and offers a resource of embryonically expressed lncRNAs in zebra finch. We also predicted the biological function of identified lncRNAs.

AB  - Background: Interest in single-cell transcriptomic analysis is growing rapidly, especially for profiling rare or heterogeneous populations of cells. In almost all reported works investigators have used live cells, which introduces cell stress during preparation and hinders complex study designs. Recent studies have indicated that cells fixed by denaturing fixative can be used in single-cell sequencing, however they did not usually work with most types of primary cells including immune cells. Methods: The methanol-fixation and new processing method was introduced to preserve human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis on 10x Chromium platform. Results: When methanol fixation protocol was broken up into three steps: fixation, storage and rehydration, we found that PBMC RNA was degraded during rehydration with PBS, not at cell fixation and up to 3-month storage steps. Resuspension but not rehydration in 3x saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer instead of PBS preserved PBMC RNA integrity and prevented RNA leakage. Diluted SSC buffer did not interfere with full-length cDNA synthesis. The methanol-fixed PBMCs resuspended in 3x SSC were successfully implemented into 10x Chromium standard scRNA-seq workflows with no elevated low quality cells and cell doublets. The fixation process did not alter the single-cell transcriptional profiles and gene expression levels. Major subpopulations classified by marker genes could be identified in fixed PBMCs at a similar proportion as in live PBMCs. This new fixation processing protocol also worked in several other fixed primary cell types and cell lines as in live ones. Conclusions: We expect that the methanol-based cell fixation procedure presented here will allow better and more effective batching schemes for a complex single cell experimental design with primary cells or tissues.

AB  - Read counting and unique molecular identifier (UMI) counting are the principal gene expression quantification schemes used in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. By using multiple scRNA-seq datasets, we reveal distinct distribution differences between these schemes and conclude that the negative binomial model is a good approximation for UMI counts, even in heterogeneous populations. We further propose a novel differential expression analysis algorithm based on a negative binomial model with independent dispersions in each group (NBID). Our results show that this properly controls the FDR and achieves better power for UMI counts when compared to other recently developed packages for scRNA-seq analysis.

AB  - Motivation: NGS techniques have been widely applied in genetic and epigenetic studies. Multiple ChIP-seq and RNA-seq profiles can now be jointly used to infer functional regulatory networks (FRNs). However, existing methods suffer from either oversimplified assumption on transcription factor (TF) regulation or slow convergence of sampling for FRN inference from large-scale ChIPseq and time-course RNA-seq data. Results: We developed an efficient Bayesian integration method (CRNET) for FRN inference using a two-stage Gibbs sampler to estimate iteratively hidden TF activities and the posterior probabilities of binding events. A novel statistic measure that jointly considers regulation strength and regression error enables the sampling process of CRNET to converge quickly, thus making CRNET very efficient for large-scale FRN inference. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark data showed a significantly improved performance of CRNET when compared with existing methods. CRNET was applied to breast cancer data to identify FRNs functional at promoter or enhancer regions in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Transcription factor MYC is predicted as a key functional factor in both promoter and enhancer FRNs. We experimentally validated the regulation effects of MYC on CRNET-predicted target genes using appropriate RNAi approaches in MCF-7 cells.

AB  - The flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a dicot model organism for research in many aspects of plant biology. A comprehensive annotation of its genome paves the way for understanding the functions and activities of all types of transcripts, including mRNA, the various classes of non-coding RNA, and small RNA. The TAIR10 annotation update had a profound impact on Arabidopsis research but was released more than 5years ago. Maintaining the accuracy of the annotation continues to be a prerequisite for future progress. Using an integrative annotation pipeline, we assembled tissue-specific RNA-Seq libraries from 113 datasets and constructed 48359 transcript models of protein-coding genes in eleven tissues. In addition, we annotated various classes of non-coding RNA including microRNA, long intergenic RNA, small nucleolar RNA, natural antisense transcript, small nuclear RNA, and small RNA using published datasets and in-house analytic results. Altogether, we identified 635 novel protein-coding genes, 508 novel transcribed regions, 5178 non-coding RNAs, and 35846 small RNA loci that were formerly unannotated. Analysis of the splicing events and RNA-Seq based expression profiles revealed the landscapes of gene structures, untranslated regions, and splicing activities to be more intricate than previously appreciated. Furthermore, we present 692 uniformly expressed housekeeping genes, 43% of whose human orthologs are also housekeeping genes. This updated Arabidopsis genome annotation with a substantially increased resolution of gene models will not only further our understanding of the biological processes of this plant model but also of other species.

AB  - Background: The advent and ongoing development of next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) has led to a rapid increase in the rate of human genome re-sequencing data, paving the way for personalized genomics and precision medicine. The body of genome resequencing data is progressively increasing underlining the need for accurate and time-effective bioinformatics systems for genotyping - a crucial prerequisite for identification of candidate causal mutations in diagnostic screens. Results: Here we present CoVaCS, a fully automated, highly accurate system with a web based graphical interface for genotyping and variant annotation. Extensive tests on a gold standard benchmark data-set -the NA12878 Illumina platinum genome-confirm that call-sets based on our consensus strategy are completely in line with those attained by similar command line based approaches, and far more accurate than call-sets from any individual tool. Importantly our system exhibits better sensitivity and higher specificity than equivalent commercial software. Conclusions: CoVaCS offers optimized pipelines integrating state of the art tools for variant calling and annotation for whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES) and target-gene sequencing (TGS) data. The system is currently hosted at Cineca, and offers the speed of a HPC computing facility, a crucial consideration when large numbers of samples must be analysed. Importantly, all the analyses are performed automatically allowing high reproducibility of the results. As such, we believe that CoVaCS can be a valuable tool for the analysis of human genome resequencing studies.

AB  - Background: RNA-seq is a powerful and cost-effective technology for molecular diagnostics of cancer and other diseases, and it can reach its full potential when coupled with validated clinical-grade informatics tools. Despite recent advances in long-read sequencing, transcriptome assembly of short reads remains a useful and cost-effective methodology for unveiling transcript-level rearrangements and novel isoforms. One of the major concerns for adopting the proven de novo assembly approach for RNA-seq data in clinical settings has been the analysis turnaround time. To address this concern, we have developed a targeted approach to expedite assembly and analysis of RNA-seq data. Results: Here we present our Targeted Assembly Pipeline (TAP), which consists of four stages: 1) alignment-free gene-level classification of RNA-seq reads using BioBloomTools, 2) de novo assembly of individual targets using Trans-ABySS, 3) alignment of assembled contigs to the reference genome and transcriptome with GMAP and BWA and 4) structural and splicing variant detection using PAVFinder. We show that PAVFinder is a robust gene fusion detection tool when compared to established methods such as Tophat-Fusion and deFuse on simulated data of 448 events. Using the Leucegene acute myeloid leukemia (AML) RNA-seq data and a set of 580 COSMIC target genes, TAP identified a wide range of hallmark molecular anomalies including gene fusions, tandem duplications, insertions and deletions in agreement with published literature results. Moreover, also in this dataset, TAP captured AML-specific splicing variants such as skipped exons and novel splice sites reported in studies elsewhere. Running time of TAP on 100-150 million read pairs and a 580-gene set is one to 2 hours on a 48-core machine. Conclusions: We demonstrated that TAP is a fast and robust RNA-seq variant detection pipeline that is potentially amenable to clinical applications.

AB  - BackgroundThe use of microarrays and RNA-seq technologies is ubiquitous for transcriptome analyses in modern biology. With proper analysis tools, the differential gene expression analysis process can be significantly accelerated. Many open-source programs provide cutting-edge techniques, but these often require programming skills and lack intuitive and interactive or graphical user interfaces. To avoid bottlenecks impeding seamless analysis processing, we have developed an Interactive Gene Expression Analysis Kit, we term iGEAK, focusing on usability and interactivity. iGEAK is designed to be a simple, intuitive, light-weight that contrasts with heavy-duty programs.ResultsiGEAK is an R/Shiny-based client-side desktop application, providing an interactive gene expression data analysis pipeline for microarray and RNA-seq data. Gene expression data can be intuitively explored using a seamless analysis pipeline consisting of sample selection, differentially expressed gene prediction, protein-protein interaction, and gene set enrichment analyses. For each analysis step, users can easily alter parameters to mine more relevant biological information.ConclusioniGEAK is the outcome of close collaboration with wet-bench biologists who are eager to easily explore, mine, and analyze new or public microarray and RNA-seq data. We designed iGEAK as a gene expression analysis pipeline tool to provide essential analysis steps and a user-friendly interactive graphical user interface. iGEAK enables users without programing knowledge to comfortably perform differential gene expression predictions and downstream analyses. iGEAK packages, manuals, tutorials, sample datasets are available at the iGEAK project homepage (https://sites.google.com/view/iGEAK).

AB  - Humans are a diploid species that inherit one set of chromosomes paternally and one homologous set of chromosomes maternally. Unfortunately, most human sequencing initiatives ignore this fact in that they do not directly delineate the nucleotide content of the maternal and paternal copies of the 23 chromosomes individuals possess (i.e., they do not 'phase' the genome) often because of the costs and complexities of doing so. We compared 11 different widely-used approaches to phasing human genomes using the publicly available 'Genome-In-A-Bottle' (GIAB) phased version of the NA12878 genome as a gold standard. The phasing strategies we compared included laboratory-based assays that prepare DNA in unique ways to facilitate phasing as well as purely computational approaches that seek to reconstruct phase information from general sequencing reads and constructs or population-level haplotype frequency information obtained through a reference panel of haplotypes. To assess the performance of the 11 approaches, we used metrics that included, among others, switch error rates, haplotype block lengths, the proportion of fully phase-resolved genes, phasing accuracy and yield between pairs of SNVs. Our comparisons suggest that a hybrid or combined approach that leverages: 1. population-based phasing using the SHAPEIT software suite, 2. either genome-wide sequencing read data or parental genotypes, and 3. a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies, provides a fast and efficient way to produce highly accurate phase-resolved individual human genomes. We found that for population-based approaches, phasing performance is enhanced with the addition of genome-wide read data; e.g., whole genome shotgun and/or RNA sequencing reads. Further, we found that the inclusion of parental genotype data within a population-based phasing strategy can provide as much as a ten-fold reduction in phasing errors. We also considered a majority voting scheme for the construction of a consensus haplotype combining multiple predictions for enhanced performance and site coverage. Finally, we also identified DNA sequence signatures associated with the genomic regions harboring phasing switch errors, which included regions of low polymorphism or SNV density.

AB  - In this case report we describe our investigation into the genetic cause of infertility due to idiopathic nonobstructive azoospermia in a consanguineous Turkish family. We extracted DNA from blood and applied whole exome sequencing on 4 infertile brothers in this family diagnosed with oligo- and azoospermia. Standard bioinformatics analysis pipelines were run including alignment to the reference genome, variant calling, and quality control filtering. Potentially pathogenic variants were identified and prioritized using genetic variant annotation software and public variant frequency databases, followed by validation with Sanger sequencing. A nonsynonymous variant in "general transcription factor TFIIH subunit 3" (GTF2H3) was identified in this consanguineous family. This variant in chromosome 12 (12chr: 124144111 T>C, p. Ser222Pro) of GTF2H3 represents a likely a disease-causing mutation as it is predicted to be damaging, rare, segregates with the disease, and is highly evolutionarily conserved. Familial segregation analysis of the variant showed that it was present as a homozygous mutation in the brothers with nonobstructive azoospermia, and heterozygous mutation in the oligospermic brothers. We propose a mechanism by which this variant leads to deficits in Vitamin A signaling, which is essential for spermatogenesis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Motivation: Alternative splicing (AS) has been demonstrated to play a role in shaping eukaryotic gene diversity at the transcriptional level. However, the impact of AS on the proteome is still controversial. Studies that seek to explore the effect of AS at the proteomic level are hampered by technical difficulties in the cumbersome process of casting forth and back between genome, transcriptome and proteome space coordinates, and the naive prediction of protein domains in the presence of AS suffers many redundant sequence scans that emerge from constitutively spliced regions that are shared between alternative products of a gene. Results: We developed the AstaFunk pipeline that computes for every generic transcriptome all domains that are altered by AS events in a systematic and efficient manner. In a nutshell, our method employs Viterbi dynamic programming, which guarantees to find all score-optimal hits of the domains under consideration, while complementary optimizations at different levels avoid redundant and other irrelevant computations. We evaluate AstaFunk qualitatively and quantitatively using RNAseq in well-studied genes with AS, and on large-scale employing entire transcriptomes. Our study confirms complementary reports that the effect of most AS events on the proteome seems to be rather limited, but our results also pinpoint several cases where AS could have a major impact on the function of a protein domain.

AB  - Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically relies on reconstructing transcripts or counting reads that overlap known gene structures. We previously introduced an intermediate statistical approach called differentially expressed region (DER) finder that seeks to identify contiguous regions of the genome showing differential expression signal at single base resolution without relying on existing annotation or potentially inaccurate transcript assembly. We present the derfinder software that improves our annotation-agnostic approach to RNA-seq analysis by: (i) implementing a computationally efficient bump-hunting approach to identify DERs that permits genome-scale analyses in a large number of samples, (ii) introducing a flexible statistical modeling framework, including multi-group and timecourse analyses and (iii) introducing a new set of data visualizations for expressed region analysis. We apply this approach to public RNA-seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and BrainSpan project to show that derfinder permits the analysis of hundreds of samples at base resolution in R, identifies expression outside of known gene boundaries and can be used to visualize expressed regions at base-resolution. In simulations, our base resolution approaches enable discovery in the presence of incomplete annotation and is nearly as powerful as feature-level methods when the annotation is complete. derfinder analysis using expressed region-level and single base-level approaches provides a compromise between full transcript reconstruction and feature-level analysis.

AB  - Single-molecule full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) sequencing can aid genome annotation by revealing transcript structure and alternative splice forms, yet current annotation pipelines do not incorporate such information. Here we present long-read annotation (LoReAn) software, an automated annotation pipeline utilizing short-and long-read cDNA sequencing, protein evidence, and ab initio prediction to generate accurate genome annotations. Based on annotations of two fungal genomes (Verticillium dahliae and Plicaturopsis crispa) and two plant genomes (Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana] and Oryza sativa), we show that LoReAn outperforms popular annotation pipelines by integrating single-molecule cDNA-sequencing data generated from either the Pacific Biosciences or MinION sequencing platforms, correctly predicting gene structure, and capturing genes missed by other annotation pipelines.

AB  - RNA-binding proteins recognize RNA sequences and structures, but there is currently no systematic and accurate method to derive large (>12 base) motifs de novo that reflect a combination of intrinsic preference to both sequence and structure. To address this absence, we introduce RNAcompete-S, which couples a single-step competitive binding reaction with an excess of random RNA 40-mers to a custom computational pipeline for interrogation of the bound RNA sequences and derivation of SSMs (Sequence and Structure Models). RNAcompete-S confirms that HuR, QKI, and SRSF1 prefer binding sites that are single stranded, and recapitulates known 8-10 bp sequence and structure preferences for Vts1 p and RBMY. We also derive an 18-base long SSM for Drosophila SLBP, which to our knowledge has not been previously determined by selections from pure random sequence, and accurately discriminates human replication-dependent histone mRNAs. Thus, RNAcompete-S enables accurate identification of large, intrinsic sequence-structure specificities with a uniform assay. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Deformed wing virus (DWV) is a major pathogen of concern to apiculture, and recent reports have indicated the local predominance and potential virulence of recombinants between DWV and a related virus, Varroa destructor virus 1 (VDV). However, little is known about the frequency and titer of VDV and recombinants relative to DWV generally. In this study, I assessed the relative occurrence and titer of DWV and VDV in public RNA-seq accessions of honey bee using a rapid, kmer-based approach. Three recombinant types were detectable graphically and corroborated by de novo assembly. Recombination breakpoints did not disrupt the capsid-encoding region, consistent with previous reports, and both VDV-and DWV-derived capsids were observed in recombinant backgrounds. High abundance of VDV killers was largely restricted to recombinant forms. Non-metric multidimensional scaling identified genotypic clusters among DWV isolates, which was corroborated by read mapping and consensus generation. The recently described DWV-C lineage was not detected in the searched accessions. The data further highlight the utility of high-throughput sequencing to monitor viral polymorphisms and statistically test biological predictors of titer, and point to the need for consistent methodologies and sampling schemes.

AB  - Background: RNA sequencing has become a ubiquitous technology used throughout life sciences as an effective method of measuring RNA abundance quantitatively in tissues and cells. The increase in use of RNA-seq technology has led to the continuous development of new tools for every step of analysis from alignment to downstream pathway analysis. However, effectively using these analysis tools in a scalable and reproducible way can be challenging, especially for non-experts. Results: Using the workflow management system Snakemake we have developed a user friendly, fast, efficient, and comprehensive pipeline for RNA-seq analysis. VIPER (Visualization Pipeline for RNA-seq analysis) is an analysis workflow that combines some of the most popular tools to take RNA-seq analysis from raw sequencing data, through alignment and quality control, into downstream differential expression and pathway analysis. VIPER has been created in a modular fashion to allow for the rapid incorporation of new tools to expand the capabilities. This capacity has already been exploited to include very recently developed tools that explore immune infiltrate and T-cell CDR (Complementarity-Determining Regions) reconstruction abilities. The pipeline has been conveniently packaged such that minimal computational skills are required to download and install the dozens of software packages that VIPER uses. Conclusions: VIPER is a comprehensive solution that performs most standard RNA-seq analyses quickly and effectively with a built-in capacity for customization and expansion.

AB  - Congenital hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (CHH) is a challenging inherited endocrine disorder characterised by absent or incomplete pubertal development and infertility as a result of the low action/secretion of the hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Given a growing list of gene mutations accounting for CHH, the application of massively parallel sequencing comprises an excellent molecular diagnostic approach because it enables the simultaneous evaluation of many genes. The present study proposes the use of whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify causative and modifying mutations based on a phenotype-genotype CHH analysis using an in-house exome pipeline. Based on 44 known genes related to CHH in humans, we were able to identify a novel homozygous gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR) p.Thr269Met mutant, which segregates with the CHH kindred and was predicted to be deleterious by in silico analysis. A functional study measuring intracellular inositol phosphate (IP) when stimulated with GnRH on COS-7 cells confirmed that the p.Thr269Met GnRHR mutant performed greatly diminished IP accumulation relative to the transfected wild-type GnRHR. Additionally, the proband carries three heterozygous variants in CCDC141 and one homozygous in SEMA3A gene, although their effects with respect to modifying the phenotype are uncertain. Because they do not segregate with reproductive phenotype in family members, we advocate they do not contribute to CHH oligogenicity. WES proved to be useful for CHH molecular diagnosis and reinforced its benefit with respect to identifying heterogeneous genetic disorders. Our findings expand the GnRHR mutation spectrum and phenotype-genotype correlation in CHH.

AB  - Background: The chronically instrumented fetal sheep is a widely used animal model to study fetal brain development in health and disease, but no methods exist yet to interrogate dedicated brain cell populations to identify their molecular and genomic phenotype. For example, the molecular mechanisms whereby microglia or astrocytes contribute to inflammation in the brain remain incompletely understood. New method: Here we present a protocol to derive primary pure microglial or astrocyte cultures from near -term fetal sheep brain, after the animals have been chronically instrumented and studied in vivo. Next, we present the implementation of whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) pipeline to deeper elucidate the phenotype of such primary sheep brain glial cultures. Results: We validate the new primary cultures method for cell purity and test the function of the glial cells on protein (IL-1 beta) and transcriptome (RNAseq) levels in response to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in vitro. Comparison with existing methods: This method represents the first implementation of pure microglial or astrocytes cultures in fetal sheep brain. Conclusions: The presented approach opens new possibilities for testing not only supernatant protein levels in response to an in vitro challenge, but also to evaluate changes in the transcriptome of glial cells derived from a large mammalian brain bearing high resemblance to the human brain. Moreover, the presented approach lends itself to modeling the complex multi-hit paradigms of antenatal and perinatal cerebral insults in vivo and in vitro. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The correct identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between specific conditions is a key in the understanding phenotypic variation. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the main option for these studies. Thus, the number of methods and softwares for differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data also increased rapidly. However, there is no consensus about the most appropriate pipeline or protocol for identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. This work presents an extended review on the topic that includes the evaluation of six methods of mapping reads, including pseudo-alignment and quasi-mapping and nine methods of differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data. The adopted methods were evaluated based on real RNA-Seq data, using qRT-PCR data as reference (gold-standard). As part of the results, we developed a software that performs all the analysis presented in this work, which is freely available at https://github. com/costasilvati/consexpression. The results indicated that mapping methods have minimal impact on the final DEGs analysis, considering that adopted data have an annotated reference genome. Regarding the adopted experimental model, the DEGs identification methods that have more consistent results were the limma + voom, NOIseq and DESeq2. Additionally, the consensus among five DEGs identification methods guarantees a list of DEGs with great accuracy, indicating that the combination of different methods can produce more suitable results. The consensus option is also included for use in the available software.

AB  - To detect functional somatic mutations in tumor samples, whole-exome sequencing (WES) is often used for its reliability and relative low cost. RNA-seq, while generally used to measure gene expression, can potentially also be used for identification of somatic mutations. However there has been little systematic evaluation of the utility of RNA-seq for identifying somatic mutations. Here, we develop and evaluate a pipeline for processing RNA-seq data from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors in order to identify somatic mutations. The pipeline entails the use of the STAR aligner 2-pass procedure jointly with MuTect2 from genome analysis toolkit (GATK) to detect somatic variants. Variants identified from RNA-seq data were evaluated by comparison against the COSMIC and dbSNP databases, and also compared to somatic variants identified by exome sequencing. We also estimated the putative functional impact of coding variants in the most frequently mutated genes in GBM. Interestingly, variants identified by RNA-seq alone showed better representation of GBM-related mutations cataloged by COSMIC. RNA-seq-only data substantially outperformed the ability of WES to reveal potentially new somatic mutations in known GBM-related pathways, and allowed us to build a high-quality set of somatic mutations common to exome and RNA-seq calls. Using RNA-seq data in parallel with WES data to detect somatic mutations in cancer genomes can thus broaden the scope of discoveries and lend additional support to somatic variants identified by exome sequencing alone.

AB  - Rapid advances in genomic technologies have facilitated the identification pathogenic variants causing human disease. We report siblings with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy due to a novel, shared heterozygous pathogenic 13 bp duplication in SYNGAP1 (c.435_447dup, p.(L150Vfs*6)) that was identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS). The pathogenic variant had escaped earlier detection via two methodologies: whole exome sequencing and high-depth targeted sequencing. Both technologies had produced reads carrying the variant, however, they were either not aligned due to the size of the insertion or aligned to multiple major histocompatibility complex (MHC) regions in the hg19 reference genome, making the critical reads unavailable for variant calling. The WGS pipeline followed different protocols, including alignment of reads to the GRCh37 reference genome, which lacks the additional MHC contigs. Our findings highlight the benefit of using orthogonal clinical bioinformatic pipelines and all relevant inheritance patterns to re-analyze genomic data in undiagnosed patients.

AB  - Background: Metagenomics is a rapidly emerging field aimed to analyze microbial diversity and dynamics by studying the genomic content of the microbiota. Metataxonomics tools analyze high-throughput sequencing data, primarily from 16S rRNA gene sequencing and DNAseq, to identify microorganisms and viruses within a complex mixture. With the growing demand for analysis of the functional microbiome, metatranscriptome studies attract more interest. To make metatranscriptomic data sufficient for metataxonomics, new analytical workflows are needed to deal with sparse and taxonomically less informative sequencing data. Results: We present a new protocol, IMSA+ A, for accurate taxonomy classification based on metatranscriptome data of any read length that can efficiently and robustly identify bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the same sample. The new protocol improves accuracy by using a conservative reference database, employing a new counting scheme, and by assembling shotgun reads. Assembly also reduces analysis runtime. Simulated data were utilized to evaluate the protocol by permuting common experimental variables. When applied to the real metatranscriptome data for mouse intestines colonized by ASF, the protocol showed superior performance in detection of the microorganisms compared to the existing metataxonomics tools. IMSA+ A is available at https://github com/JeremyCoxBMI/IMSA-A. Conclusions: The developed protocol addresses the need for taxonomy classification from RNAseq data. Previously not utilized, i. e., unmapped to a reference genome, RNAseq reads can now be used to gather taxonomic information about the microbiota present in a biological sample without conducting additional sequencing. Any metatranscriptome pipeline that includes assembly of reads can add this analysis with minimal additional cost of compute time. The new protocol also creates an opportunity to revisit old metatranscriptome data, where taxonomic content may be important but was not analyzed.

AB  - Because of the extended period of clinic data collection and huge size of analyzed samples, the long-term and large-scale pharmacometabonomics profiling is frequently encountered in the discovery of drug/target and the guidance of personalized medicine. So far, integration of the results (ReIn) from multiple experiments in a large-scale metabolomic profiling has become a widely used strategy for enhancing the reliability and robustness of analytical results, and the strategy of direct data merging (DiMe) among experiments is also proposed to increase statistical power, reduce experimental bias, enhance reproducibility and improve overall biological understanding. However, compared with the ReIn, the DiMe has not yet been widely adopted in current metabolomics studies, due to the difficulty in removing unwanted variations and the inexistence of prior knowledges on the performance of the available merging methods. It is therefore urgently needed to clarify whether DiMe can enhance the performance of metabolic profiling or not. Herein, the performance of DiMe on 4 pairs of benchmark datasets was comprehensively assessed by multiple criteria (classification capacity, robustness and false discovery rate). As a result, integration/merging-based strategies (ReIn and DiMe) were found to perform better under all criteria than those strategies based on single experiment. Moreover, DiMe was discovered to outperform ReIn in classification capacity and robustness, while the ReIn showed superior capacity in controlling false discovery rate. In conclusion, these findings provided valuable guidance to the selection of suitable analytical strategy for current metabolomics.

AB  - Metabolic reprogramming is a general feature of cancer cells. Regrettably, the comprehensive quantification of metabolites in biological specimens does not promptly translate into knowledge on the utilization of metabolic pathways. By estimating fluxes across metabolic pathways, computational models hold the promise to bridge this gap between data and biological functionality. These models currently portray the average behavior of cell populations however, masking the inherent heterogeneity that is part and parcel of tumorigenesis as much as drug resistance. To remove this limitation, we propose single-cell Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA) as a computational framework to translate single-cell transcriptomes into single-cell fluxomes. We show that the integration of single-cell RNA-seq profiles of cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer patients into a multi-scale stoichiometric model of a cancer cell population: significantly 1) reduces the space of feasible single-cell fluxomes; 2) allows to identify clusters of cells with different growth rates within the population; 3) points out the possible metabolic interactions among cells via exchange of metabolites. The scFBA suite of MATLAB functions is available at https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/scFBA, as well as the case study datasets.

AB  - Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed male cancer in the world. The molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression are still unclear. Here we show analysis of a prostate cancer RNA-sequencing dataset that was originally generated by Ren et al. [3] from the prostate tumor and adjacent normal tissues of 14 patients. The data presented here was analyzed using our RNA-sequencing bioinformatics analysis pipeline implemented on the bioinformatics web platform, Galaxy. The relative expression of fibronectin (FN1) and the androgen receptor (AR) were calculated in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads, and represented in FPKM unit. A subanalysis is also shown for data from three patients, that includes the relative expression of FN1 and AR and their fold change. For interpretation and discussion, please refer to the article, "miR-1207-3p regulates the androgen receptor in prostate cancer via FNDC1/fibronectin" [1] by Das et al. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses can benefit from performing a genome-guided and de novo assembly, in particular for species where the reference genome or the annotation is incomplete. However, tools for integrating an assembled transcriptome with reference annotation are lacking. Findings: Necklace is a software pipeline that runs genome-guided and de novo assembly and combines the resulting transcriptomes with reference genome annotations. Necklace constructs a compact but comprehensive superTranscriptome out of the assembled and reference data. Reads are subsequently aligned and counted in preparation for differential expression testing. Conclusions: Necklace allows a comprehensive transcriptome to be built from a combination of assembled and annotated transcripts, which results in a more comprehensive transcriptome for the majority of organisms. In addition RNA-seq data are mapped back to this newly created superTranscript reference to enable differential expression testing with standard methods.

AB  - Interpretation of variants of unknown significance (VUS) is a major challenge for laboratories performing molecular diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), especially considering that many genes are now known to be involved in this syndrome. One important way these VUS can have a functional impact is through their effects on RNA splicing. Here we present a custom RNA-Seq assay plus bioinformatics and biostatistics pipeline to analyse specifically alternative and abnormal splicing junctions in 11 targeted HBOC genes. Our pipeline identified 14 new alternative splices in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in addition to detecting the majority of known alternative spliced transcripts therein. We provide here the first global splicing pattern analysis for the other nine genes, which will enable a comprehensive interpretation of splicing defects caused by VUS in HBOC. Previously known splicing alterations were consistently detected, occasionally with a more complex splicing pattern than expected. We also found that splicing in the 11 genes is similar in blood and breast tissue, supporting the utility and simplicity of blood splicing assays. Our pipeline is ready to be integrated into standard molecular diagnosis for HBOC, but it could equally be adapted for an integrative analysis of any multigene disorder.

AB  - Objective To uncover the microRNA (miRNA) interactome of the osteoarthritis (OA) pathophysiological process in the cartilage. Methods We performed RNA sequencing in 130 samples (n=35 and n=30 pairs for messenger RNA (mRNA) and miRNA, respectively) on macroscopically preserved and lesioned OA cartilage from the same patient and performed differential expression (DE) analysis of miRNA and mRNAs. To build an OA-specific miRNA interactome, a prioritisation scheme was applied based on inverse Pearson's correlations and inverse DE of miRNAs and mRNAs. Subsequently, these were filtered by those present in predicted (TargetScan/microT-CDS) and/or experimentally validated (miRTarBase/TarBase) public databases. Pathway enrichment analysis was applied to elucidate OA-related pathways likely mediated by miRNA regulatory mechanisms. Results We found 142 miRNAs and 2387 mRNAs to be differentially expressed between lesioned and preserved OA articular cartilage. After applying prioritisation towards likely miRNA-mRNA targets, a regulatory network of 62 miRNAs targeting 238 mRNAs was created. Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis of these mRNAs (or genes) elucidated that genes within the 'nervous system development' are likely mediated by miRNA regulatory mechanisms (familywise error = 8.4 x 10(-5)). Herein NTF3 encodes neurotrophin-3, which controls survival and differentiation of neurons and which is closely related to the nerve growth factor. Conclusions By an integrated approach of miRNA and mRNA sequencing data of OA cartilage, an OA miRNA interactome and related pathways were elucidated. Our functional data demonstrated interacting levels at which miRNA affects expression of genes in the cartilage and exemplified the complexity of functionally validating a network of genes that may be targeted by multiple miRNAs.

AB  - Asian soybean rust (ASR), caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi, can cause losses greater than 80%. Despite its economic importance, there is no soybean cultivar with durable ASR resistance. In addition, the P. pachyrhizi genome is not yet available. However, the availability of other rust genomes, as well as the development of sample enrichment strategies and bioinformatics tools, has improved our knowledge of the ASR secretome and its potential effectors. In this context, we used a combination of laser capture microdissection (LCM), RNAseq and a bioinformatics pipeline to identify a total of 36 350 P. pachyrhizi contigs expressed in planta and a predicted secretome of 851 proteins. Some of the predicted secreted proteins had characteristics of candidate effectors: small size, cysteine rich, do not contain PFAM domains (except those associated with pathogenicity) and strongly expressed in planta. A comparative analysis of the predicted secreted proteins present in Pucciniales species identified new members of soybean rust and new Pucciniales- or P. pachyrhizi-specific families (tribes). Members of some families were strongly up-regulated during early infection, starting with initial infection through haustorium formation. Effector candidates selected from two of these families were able to suppress immunity in transient assays, and were localized in the plant cytoplasm and nuclei. These experiments support our bioinformatics predictions and show that these families contain members that have functions consistent with P. pachyrhizi effectors.

AB  - Given the current cost-effectiveness of next-generation sequencing, the amount of DNAseq and RNA-seq data generated is ever increasing. One of the primary objectives of NGS experiments is calling genetic variants. While highly accurate, most variant calling pipelines are not optimized to run efficiently on large data sets. However, as variant calling in genomic data has become common practice, several methods have been proposed to reduce runtime for DNA-seq analysis through the use of parallel computing. Determining the effectively expressed variants from transcriptomics (RNA-seq) data has only recently become possible, and as such does not yet benefit from efficiently parallelized workflows. We introduce Halvade-RNA, a parallel, multi-node RNA-seq variant calling pipeline based on the GATK Best Practices recommendations. Halvade-RNA makes use of the MapReduce programming model to create and manage parallel data streams on which multiple instances of existing tools such as STAR and GATK operate concurrently. Whereas the single-threaded processing of a typical RNA-seq sample requires similar to 28h, Halvade-RNA reduces this runtime to similar to 2h using a small cluster with two 20-core machines. Even on a single, multi-core workstation, Halvade-RNA can significantly reduce runtime compared to using multi-threading, thus providing for a more cost-effective processing of RNA-seq data. Halvade-RNA is written in Java and uses the Hadoop MapReduce 2.0 API. It supports a wide range of distributions of Hadoop, including Cloudera and Amazon EMR.

AB  - The genomic revolution has fundamentally changed how we survey biodiversity on earth. High-throughput sequencing ("HTS") platforms now enable the rapid sequencing of DNA from diverse kinds of environmental samples (termed "environmental DNA" or "eDNA"). Coupling HTS with our ability to associate sequences from eDNA with a taxonomic name is called "eDNA metabarcoding" and offers a powerful molecular tool capable of noninvasively surveying species richness from many ecosystems. Here, we review the use of eDNA metabarcoding for surveying animal and plant richness, and the challenges in using eDNA approaches to estimate relative abundance. We highlight eDNA applications in freshwater, marine and terrestrial environments, and in this broad context, we distill what is known about the ability of different eDNA sample types to approximate richness in space and across time. We provide guiding questions for study design and discuss the eDNA metabarcoding workflow with a focus on primers and library preparation methods. We additionally discuss important criteria for consideration of bioinformatic filtering of data sets, with recommendations for increasing transparency. Finally, looking to the future, we discuss emerging applications of eDNA metabarcoding in ecology, conservation, invasion biology, biomonitoring, and how eDNA metabarcoding can empower citizen science and biodiversity education.

AB  - Purpose: Despite various differences, nontranslocation-related sarcomas (e.g., comprising undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma) are unified by their complex genetics. Extensive analysis of the tumor genome using molecular cytogenetic approaches showed many chromosomal gains, losses, and translocations per cell. Genomic quantitative alterations and expression variations have been extensively studied by adapted high-throughput approaches, yet translocations still remained unscreened. We therefore analyzed 117 nontranslocation-related sarcomas by RNA sequencing to identify fusion genes. Experimental design: We performed RNA sequencing and applied a bioinformatics pipeline dedicated to the detection of fusion transcripts. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing were then applied to validate predictions and to search for recurrence and specificity. Results: Among the 6,772 predicted fusion genes, 420 were inframe. One recurrent rearrangement, consistently involving TRIO with various partners, was identified in 5.1% of cases. TRIO translocations are either intrachromosomal with TERT or interchromosomal with LINC01504 or ZNF558. Our results suggest that all translocations led to a truncated TRIO protein either directly or indirectly by alternative splicing. TRIO rearrangement is associated with a modified transcriptomic program to immunity/inflammation, proliferation and migration, and an increase in proliferation. Conclusions: TRIO fusions have been identified in four different sarcoma histotypes, likely meaning that they are not related to a primary oncogenic event but rather to a secondary one implicated in tumor progression. Moreover, they appear to be specific to nontranslocation-related sarcomas, as no such rearrangement was identified in sarcomas with simple genetics. More cases could lead to a significant association of these fusions to a specific clinical behavior. (C) 2016 AACR.

AB  - Three distinct biological reactors fed with synthetic medium (UASB_Control), synthetic medium and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS; UASB_SL), and real laundry wastewater (UASB_LW) were compared using a metatranscriptomic approach to determine putative bioindicator genes and taxonomies associated to all steps of anaerobic LAS biodegradation pathway. A homemade bioinformatics pipeline combined with an R workflow was developed to perform the RNAseq data analysis. UASB_SL and UASB_LW showed similar values of LAS biological degradation (-47%) and removal (53-55%). Rarefaction analysis revealed that 1-2 million reads were sufficient to access the whole functional capacity. In the first step of LAS biodegradation pathway, fumarate reductase subunit C was detected and taxonomically assigned to the genus Syntrophobacter (0.002% - UASB_SL; 0.0015% - UASB_LW; not detected - UASB_Control). In the second step, many enzymes related to beta-oxidation were observed and most of them with low relative abundance in UASB Control and taxonomically related with Smithella. Acinetobacter and Syntrophorhabdus. For the ring cleavage step, the abundance of 6 OCI-I CoA hydrolase putative gene was ten times higher in UASB_SL and UASB_LW when compared to UASB_Control, and assigned to Desulfomonile and Syntrophorhabdus. Finally, the adenylylsulfate reductase, taxonomically related with Desulfovibrio and Desulfomonile, was observed in the desulfonation step with the highest relative abundance in UASB_LW.

AB  - Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are key regulators of bacterial persistence, a multidrug-tolerant state found in bacterial species that is a major contributing factor to the growing human health crisis of antibiotic resistance. Type II TA systems consist of two proteins, a toxin and an antitoxin; the toxin is neutralized when they form a complex. The ratio of antitoxin to toxin is significantly greater than 1.0 in the susceptible population (non-persister state), but this ratio is expected to become smaller during persistence. Analysis of multiple datasets (RNA-seq, ribosome profiling) and results from translation initiation rate calculators reveal multiple mechanisms that ensure a high antitoxin-to-toxin ratio in the non-persister state. The regulation mechanisms include both translational and transcriptional regulation. We classified E. coli type II TA systems into four distinct classes based on the mechanism of differential protein production between toxin and antitoxin. We find that the most common regulation mechanism is translational regulation. This classification scheme further refines our understanding of one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying bacterial persistence, especially regarding maintenance of the antitoxin-to-toxin ratio.

AB  - Although solitary bees provide crucial pollination services for wild and managed crops, this species-rich group has been largely overlooked in pesticide regulation studies. The risk of exposure to fungicide residues is likely to be especially high if the spray occurs on, or near host plants while the bees are collecting pollen to provision their nests. For species of Osmia that consume pollen from a select group of plants (oligolecty), the inability to use pollen from non-host plants can increase their risk factor for fungicide-related toxicity. This manuscript describes protocols used to successfully rear oligolectic mason bees, Osmia ribifloris sensu lato, from egg to prepupal stage within cell culture plates under standardized laboratory conditions. The in vitro-reared bees are subsequently used to investigate the effects of fungicide exposure and pollen source on bee fitness. Based on a 2 x 2 fully crossed factorial design, the experiment examines the main and interactive effects of fungicide exposure and pollen source on larval fitness, quantified by prepupal biomass, larval developmental time, and survivorship. A major advantage of this technique is that using in vitro-reared bees reduces natural background variability and allows the simultaneous manipulation of multiple experimental parameters. The described protocol presents a versatile tool for hypotheses testing involving the suite of factors affecting bee health. For conservation efforts to be met with significant, lasting success, such insights into the complex interplay of physiological and environmental factors driving bee declines will prove to be critical.

AB  - Transcriptome resources for social insects have the potential to provide new insight into polyphenism, i.e., how divergent phenotypes arise from the same genome. Here we present a transcriptome based on paired-end RNA sequencing data for the ant Formica exsecta (Formicidae, Hymenoptera). The RNA sequencing libraries were constructed from samples of several life stages of both sexes and female castes of queens and workers, in order to maximize representation of expressed genes. We first compare the performance of common assembly and scaffolding software (Trinity, Velvet-Oases, and SOAPdenovo-trans), in producing de novo assemblies. Second, we annotate the resulting expressed contigs to the currently published genomes of ants, and other insects, including the honeybee, to filter genes that have annotation evidence of being true genes. Our pipeline resulted in a final assembly of altogether 39,262 mRNA transcripts, with an average coverage of >300X, belonging to 17,496 unique genes with annotation in the related ant species. From these genes, 536 genes were unique to one caste or sex only, highlighting the importance of comprehensive sampling. Our final assembly also showed expression of several splice variants in 6,975 genes, and we show that accounting for splice variants affects the outcome of downstream analyses such as gene ontologies. Our transcriptome provides an outstanding resource for future genetic studies on F. exsecta and other ant species, and the presented transcriptome assembly can be adapted to any non-model species that has genomic resources available from a related taxon.

AB  - The design of synthetic cells requires a detailed understanding of the relevance of genes and gene networks underlying complex cellular phenotypes. Transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq) and constraint-based metabolic modeling can be used to probe the core genetic and metabolic networks underlying a biological process. Integrating these highly complementary experimental and in silico approaches has the potential to yield a highly comprehensive understanding of the core networks of a cell. Specifically, it can facilitate the interpretation of Tn-seq data sets and identify gaps in the data that could hinder the engineering of the cellular system, while also providing providing refined models for the accurate predictions of cellular metabolism. Here, we present Tn-Core, the first easy-to-use computational pipeline specifically designed for integrating Tn-seq data with metabolic modeling, prepared for use by both experimental and computational biologists. Tn-Core is a MATLAB toolbox that contains several custom functions, and it is built upon existing functions within the COBRA Toolbox and the TIGER Toolbox. Tn-Core takes as input a genome-scale metabolic model, Tn-seq data, and optionally RNA-seq data, and returns: (i) a context-specific core metabolic model; (ii) an evaluation of redundancies within core metabolic pathways, and optionally (iii) a refined genome-scale metabolic model. A simple, user-friendly workflow, requiring limited knowledge of metabolic modeling, is provided that allows users to run the analyses and export the data as easy-to-explore files of value to both experimental and computational biologists. We demonstrate the utility of Tn-Core using Sinorhizobium meliloti, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides genome-scale metabolic reconstructions as case studies.

AB  - BackgroundTowards discovering robust cancer biomarkers, it is imperative to unravel the cellular heterogeneity of patient samples and comprehend the interactions between cancer cells and the various cell types in the tumor microenvironment. The first generation of partial' computational deconvolution methods required prior information either on the cell/tissue type proportions or the cell/tissue type-specific expression signatures and the number of involved cell/tissue types. The second generation of complete' approaches allowed estimating both of the cell/tissue type proportions and cell/tissue type-specific expression profiles directly from the mixed gene expression data, based on known (or automatically identified) cell/tissue type-specific marker genes.ResultsWe present Deblender, a flexible complete deconvolution tool operating in semi-/unsupervised mode based on the user's access to known marker gene lists and information about cell/tissue composition. In case of no prior knowledge, global gene expression variability is used in clustering the mixed data to substitute marker sets with cluster sets. In addition, we integrate a model selection criterion to predict the number of constituent cell/tissue types. Moreover, we provide a tailored algorithmic scheme to estimate mixture proportions for realistic experimental cases where the number of involved cell/tissue types exceeds the number of mixed samples. We assess the performance of Deblender and a set of state-of-the-art existing tools on a comprehensive set of benchmark and patient cancer mixture expression datasets (including TCGA).ConclusionOur results corroborate that Deblender can be a valuable tool to improve understanding of gene expression datasets with implications for prediction and clinical utilization. Deblender is implemented in MATLAB and is available from (https://github.com/kondim1983/Deblender/).

AB  - Background: Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is the least common cardiomyopathy in which the walls are rigid and the heart is restricted from stretching and filling properly. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) mutation-caused myofibril Ca2+ hypersensitivity has been shown to be associated with impaired diastolic function. This study aimed to investigate the linkage between the genotype and clinical therapy of RCM. Methods: Five sporadic pediatric RCM patients confirmed by echocardiography were enrolled in this study. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed for the cohort to find out candidate causative gene variants. Sanger sequencing confirmed the WES-identified variants. Results: TNN13 variants were found in all of the five patients. R192H mutation was shared in four patients while R204H mutation was found only in one patient. Structure investigation showed that the C terminus of TNNI3 was flexible and mutation on the C terminus was possible to cause the RCM. Catechins were prescribed for the five patients once genotype was confirmed. Ventricular diastolic function was improved in three patients during the follow-up. Conclusions: Our data demonstrated that TNNJ3 mutation-induced RCM1 is the most common type of pediatric RCM in this study. In addition, WES is a reliable approach to identify likely pathogenic genes of RCM and might be useful for the guidance of clinical treatment scheme.

While RNA-seq is becoming a de facto standard for monitoring the population of expressed transcripts in a given condition at a specific time, processing the huge amount of data it generates requires dedicated bioinformatics programs. Here, we describe a standard bioinformatics protocol using state-of-the-art tools, the STAR mapper to align reads onto a reference genome, Cufflinks to reconstruct the transcriptome, and RSEM to quantify expression levels of genes and transcripts. We present the workflow using human transcriptome sequencing data from two biological replicates of the K562 cell line produced as part of the ENCODE3 project.

AB  - Background: Detailed molecular analyses of cells from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium hold promise in identifying cellular phenotypes that drive tissue pathology and joint damage. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership RA/SLE Network aims to deconstruct autoimmune pathology by examining cells within target tissues through multiple high-dimensional assays. Robust standardized protocols need to be developed before cellular phenotypes at a single cell level can be effectively compared across patient samples. Methods: Multiple clinical sites collected cryopreserved synovial tissue fragments from arthroplasty and synovial biopsy in a 10% DMSO solution. Mechanical and enzymatic dissociation parameters were optimized for viable cell extraction and surface protein preservation for cell sorting and mass cytometry, as well as for reproducibility in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Cryopreserved synovial samples were collectively analyzed at a central processing site by a custom-designed and validated 35-marker mass cytometry panel. In parallel, each sample was flow sorted into fibroblast, T-cell, B-cell, and macrophage suspensions for bulk population RNA-seq and plate-based single-cell CEL-Seq2 RNA-seq. Results: Upon dissociation, cryopreserved synovial tissue fragments yielded a high frequency of viable cells, comparable to samples undergoing immediate processing. Optimization of synovial tissue dissociation across six clinical collection sites with similar to 30 arthroplasty and similar to 20 biopsy samples yielded a consensus digestion protocol using 100 mu g/ml of Liberase (TM) TL enzyme preparation. This protocol yielded immune and stromal cell lineages with preserved surface markers and minimized variability across replicate RNA-seq transcriptomes. Mass cytometry analysis of cells from cryopreserved synovium distinguished diverse fibroblast phenotypes, distinct populations of memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells, and multiple CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell activation states. Bulk RNA-seq of sorted cell populations demonstrated robust separation of synovial lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Single-cell RNA-seq produced transcriptomes of over 1000 genes/cell, including transcripts encoding characteristic lineage markers identified. Conclusions: We have established a robust protocol to acquire viable cells from cryopreserved synovial tissue with intact transcriptomes and cell surface phenotypes. A centralized pipeline to generate multiple high-dimensional analyses of synovial tissue samples collected across a collaborative network was developed. Integrated analysis of such datasets from large patient cohorts may help define molecular heterogeneity within RA pathology and identify new therapeutic targets and biomarkers.

AB  - RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs. At the core is a new semi-automatic algorithm SARNAclust, the first unsupervised method to identify and deconvolve multiple sequence/structure motifs simultaneously. SARNAclust computes similarity between sequence/structure objects using a graph kernel, providing the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. Application of SARNAclust to synthetic data shows its capability of clustering 5 motifs at once with a V-measure value of over 0.95, while GraphClust achieves only a V-measure of 0.083 and RNAcontext cannot detect any of the motifs. When applied to existing eCLIP sets, SARNAclust finds known motifs for SLBP and HNRNPC and novel motifs for several other RBPs such as AGGF1, AKAP8L and ILF3. We demonstrate an experimental validation protocol, a targeted Bind-n-Seq-like high-throughput sequencing approach that relies on RNA inverse folding for oligo pool design, that can validate the components within the SLBP motif. Finally, we use this protocol to experimentally interrogate the SARNAclust motif predictions for protein ILF3. Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patient-derived xenografts (PDX) can be generated from biopsies or circulating tumor cells (CTC), though scarcity of tissue and low efficiency of tumor growth have previously limited these approaches. Applying an established clinical-translational pipeline for tissue collection and an automated microfluidic platform for CTC enrichment, we generated 17 biopsy-derived PDXs and 17 CTC-derived PDXs in a 2-year timeframe, at 89% and 38% efficiency, respectively. Whole-exome sequencing showed that somatic alterations are stably maintained between patient tumors and PDXs. Early-passage PDXs maintain the genomic and transcriptional profiles of the founder PDX. In vivo treatment with etoposide and platinum (EP) in 30 PDX models demonstrated greater sensitivity in PDXs from EP-naive patients, and resistance to EP corresponded to increased expression of a MYC gene signature. Finally, serial CTC-derived PDXs generated from an individual patient at multiple time points accurately recapitulated the evolving drug sensitivities of that patient's disease. Collectively, this work highlights the translational potential of this strategy. SIGNIFICANCE: Effective translational research utilizing SCLC PDX models requires both efficient generation of models from patients and fidelity of those models in representing patient tumor characteristics. We present approaches for efficient generation of PDXs from both biopsies and CTCs, and demonstrate that these models capture the mutational landscape and functional features of the donor tumors.

AB  - As an important natural enemy of aphids and other pests in agriculture, Harmonia axyridis has been widely used in classic biological control. The testis and male accessory gland (MAG) of H. axyridis are typically associated with the ability of egg-laying by multiple mating and influence mass artificial breeding for biological control. Development-related genes might impact the growth of adult testis and MAGs, but this has not yet been reported. Here, we use an integrative time-series analysis with RNA-seq in the testis and MAGs of H. axyridis adults to detect development-related genes. > 10.3 Gb of clean data were obtained. All differentially expressed genes (DEG) between samples were analyzed with five databases for building a DEG annotation database. By combining previous reports, the DEG annotation database, and gene expression level changes in four different stages, the 26 DEGs related to testis and MAGs development were identified. To validate the expression profile, 15 random DEGs were chosen to perform RT-qPCR, and they were all in accordance with the RNA-Seq results. Taken together, this study established a robust pipeline for the discovery of key genes using RNA-seq and allowed for the class identification of development-related genes in the testis and MAGs for comprehensive characterization.

AB  - In bioinformatics, exon skipping (ES) event prediction is an essential part of alternative splicing (AS) event analysis. Although many methods have been developed to predict ES events, a solution has yet to be found. In this study, given the limitations of machine learning algorithms with RNA-Seq data or genome sequences, a new feature, called RS (RNA-seq and sequence) features, was constructed. These features include RNA-Seq features derived from the RNA-Seq data and sequence features derived from genome sequences. We propose a novel Rotation Forest classifier to predict ES events with the RS features (RotaF-RSES). To validate the efficacy of RotaF-RSES, a dataset from two human tissues was used, and RotaF-RSES achieved an accuracy of 98.4%, a specificity of 99.2%, a sensitivity of 94.1%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 98.6%. When compared to the other available methods, the results indicate that RotaF-RSES is efficient and can predict ES events with RS features.

AB  - Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon of differential allelic expression based on parental origin. To date, 263 imprinted genes have been identified among all investigated mammalian species. However, only 21 have been described in sheep, of which 11 are annotated in the current ovine genome. Here, we aim to i) use DNA/RNA high throughput sequencing to identify new monoallelically expressed and imprinted genes in day 135 ovine fetuses and ii) determine whether maternal diet (100%, 60%, or 140% of National Research Council Total Digestible Nutrients) influences expression of imprinted genes. We also reported strategies to solve technical challenges in the data analysis pipeline. We identified 80 monoallelically expressed, 13 new putative imprinted genes, and five known imprinted genes in sheep using the 263 genes stated above as a guide. Sanger sequencing confirmed allelic expression of seven genes, CASD1, COPG2, DIRAS3, INPP5F, PLAGL1, PPP1R9A, and SLC22A18. Among the 13 putative imprinted genes, five were localized in the known sheep imprinting domains of MEST on chromosome 4, DLK1/GTL2 on chromosome 18 and KCNQ1 on chromosome 21, and three were in a novel sheep imprinted cluster on chromosome 4, known in other species as PEG10/SGCE. The expression of DIRAS3, IGF2, PHLDA2, and SLC22A18 was altered by maternal diet, albeit without allelic expression reversal. Together, our results expanded the list of sheep imprinted genes to 34 and demonstrated that while the expression levels of four imprinted genes were changed by maternal diet, the allelic expression patterns were un-changed for all imprinted genes studied.

AB  - BackgroundHigh-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA metabarcoding) has become a routine tool for biodiversity survey and ecological studies. By including sample-specific tags in the primers prior PCR amplification, it is possible to multiplex hundreds of samples in a single sequencing run. The analysis of millions of sequences spread into hundreds to thousands of samples prompts for efficient, automated yet flexible analysis pipelines. Various algorithms and software have been developed to perform one or multiple processing steps, such as paired-end reads assembly, chimera filtering, Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) clustering and taxonomic assignment. Some of these software are now well established and widely used by scientists as part of their workflow. Wrappers that are capable to process metabarcoding data from raw sequencing data to annotated OTU-to-sample matrix were also developed to facilitate the analysis for non-specialist users. Yet, most of them require basic bioinformatic or command-line knowledge, which can limit the accessibility to such integrative toolkits. Furthermore, for flexibility reasons, these tools have adopted a step-by-step approach, which can prevent an easy automation of the workflow, and hence hamper the analysis reproducibility.ResultsWe introduce SLIM, an open-source web application that simplifies the creation and execution of metabarcoding data processing pipelines through an intuitive Graphic User Interface (GUI). The GUI interact with well-established software and their associated parameters, so that the processing steps are performed seamlessly from the raw sequencing data to an annotated OTU-to-sample matrix. Thanks to a module-centered organization, SLIM can be used for a wide range of metabarcoding cases, and can also be extended by developers for custom needs or for the integration of new software. The pipeline configuration (i.e. the modules chaining and all their parameters) is stored in a file that can be used for reproducing the same analysis.ConclusionThis web application has been designed to be user-friendly for non-specialists yet flexible with advanced settings and extensibility for advanced users and bioinformaticians. The source code along with full documentation is available on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/yoann-dufresne/SLIM) and a demonstration server is accessible through the application website (https://trtcrd.github.io/SLIM/).

AB  - We hypothetized that pediatric cancers would more likely harbor fusion transcripts. To dissect the complexity of the fusions landscape in recurrent solid pediatric cancers, we conducted a study on 48 patients with different relapsing or resistant malignancies. By analyzing RNA sequencing data with a new in-house pipeline for fusions detection named ChimComp, followed by verification by real-time PCR, we identified and classified the most confident fusion transcripts (FTs) according to their potential biological function and druggability. The majority of FTs were predicted to affect key cancer pathways and described to be involved in oncogenesis. Contrary to previous descriptions, we found no significant correlation between the number of fusions and mutations, emphasizing the particularity to study pre-treated pediatric patients. A considerable proportion of FTs containing tumor suppressor genes was detected, reflecting their importance in pediatric cancers. FTs containing non-receptor tyrosine kinases occurred at low incidence and predominantly in brain tumors. Remarkably, more than 30% of patients presented a potentially druggable high-confidence fusion. In conclusion, we detected new oncogenic FTs in relapsing pediatric cancer patients by establishing a robust pipeline that can be applied to other malignancies, to detect and prioritize experimental validation studies leading to the development of new therapeutic options.

AB  - Background: Amongst the echinoderms the class Ophiuroidea is of particular interest for its phylogenetic position, ecological importance and developmental and regenerative biology. However, compared to other echinoderms, notably echinoids (sea urchins), relatively little is known about developmental changes in gene expression in ophiuroids. To address this issue, we have generated and assembled a large RNAseq data set of four key stages of development in the brittle star Amphiura filiformis and a de novo reference transcriptome of comparable quality to that of a model echinoderm-the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Furthermore, we provide access to the new data via a web interface: http://www.echinonet.eu/shiny/Amphiura_filiformis/. Results: We have identified highly conserved genes associated with the development of a biomineralised skeleton. We also identify important class-specific characters, including the independent duplication of the msp130 class of genes in different echinoderm classes and the unique occurrence of spicule matrix (sm) genes in echinoids. Using a new quantification pipeline for our de novo transcriptome, validated with other methodologies, we find major differences between brittle stars and sea urchins in the temporal expression of many transcription factor genes. This divergence in developmental regulatory states is more evident in early stages of development when cell specification begins, rather than when cells initiate differentiation. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that there has been a high degree of gene regulatory network rewiring and clade-specific gene duplication, supporting the hypothesis of a convergent evolution of larval skeleton development in echinoderms.

AB  - Gene fusions play a critical role in some cancers and can serve as important clinical targets. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the contribution of fusions, especially by histological type, is unclear. We therefore screened for recurrent fusions in a histologically diverse panel of 220 EOCs using RNA sequencing. The Pipeline for RNA-Sequencing Data Analysis (PRADA) was used to identify fusions and allow for comparison with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) tumors. Associations between fusions and clinical prognosis were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Nine recurrent fusions, defined as occurring in two or more tumors, were observed. CRHR1-KANSL1 was the most frequently identified fusion, identified in 6 tumors (2.7% of all tumors). This fusion was not associated with survival; other recurrent fusions were too rare to warrant survival analyses. One recurrent in-frame fusion, UBAP1-TGM7, was unique to clear cell (CC) EOC tumors (in 10%, or 2 of 20 CC tumors). We found some evidence that CC tumors harbor more fusions on average than any other EOC histological type, including high-grade serous (HGS) tumors. CC tumors harbored a mean of 7.4 fusions (standard deviation [sd] = 7.4, N = 20), compared to HGS EOC tumors mean of 2.0 fusions (sd = 3.3, N = 141). Few fusion genes were detected in endometrioid tumors (mean = 0.24, sd = 0.74, N = 55) or mucinous tumors (mean = 0.25, sd = 0.5, N = 4) tumors. To conclude, we identify one fusion at 10% frequency in the CC EOC subtype, but find little evidence for common (> 5% frequency) recurrent fusion genes in EOC overall, or in HGS subtype-specific EOC tumors.

AB  - Resolvins are endogenous lipid mediators derived from omega-3 fatty acids. Resolvin E1 (RvE1), derived from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), modulates osteoclasts and immune cells in periodontal disease models. The direct role of RvE1 in bone remodeling is not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of RvE1 on bone remodeling under inflammatory conditions. Our working hypothesis is that RvE1 downregulates bone resorption through direct actions on both osteoblast and osteoclast function in inflammatory osteoclastogenesis. A tumor necrosis factor-a induced local calvarial osteolysis model with or without the systemic administration of RvE1 was used. To evaluate osteoclastogenesis and NF kappa B signaling pathway activity, murine bone tissue was evaluated by Micro CT (mu CT) analysis, TRAP staining, and immunofluorescence analysis. Mechanistically, to evaluate the direct role of RvE1 impacting bone cells, primary calvarial mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with interleukin (IL)-6 (10 ng/ml) and IL-6 receptor (10 ng/ml) and simultaneously incubated with or without RvE1 (100 nM). Expression of receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) was measured by ELISA. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and differential expression analysis was performed to determine signaling pathways impacted by RvE1. The systemic administration of RvE1 reduced calvarial bone resorption as determined by mu CT. Histologic analysis of calvaria revealed that osteoclastogenesis was reduced as determined by number and size of osteoclasts in TRAP-stained sections (p < 0.05). Immunofluorescence staining of calvarial sections revealed that RvE1 reduced RANKL secretion by 25% (p < 0.05). Stimulation of osteoblasts with IL-6 increased RANKL production by 30% changing the RANKL/OPG to favor osteoclast activation and bone resorption. The ratio changes were reversed by 100 nM RvE1. RvE1 decreased the production of RANKL maintaining an RANKL/OPG more favorable for bone formation. RNA-Seq and transcriptomic pipeline analysis revealed that RvE1 significantly downregulates osteoclast differentiation mediated by differential regulation of NF.B and PI3K-AKT pathways. RvE1 reduces inflammatory bone resorption. This action is mediated, at least in part, by direct actions on bone cells promoting a favorable RANKL/OPG ratio. Mediators of resolution in innate immunity also directly regulate bone cell gene expression that is modulated by RvE1 through at least 14 specific genes in this mouse model.

AB  - Background: Given the rarity of most single-gene Mendelian disorders, concerted efforts of data exchange between clinical and scientific communities are critical to optimize molecular diagnosis and novel disease gene discovery. Methods: We designed and implemented protocols for the study of cases for which a plausible molecular diagnosis was not achieved in a clinical genomics diagnostic laboratory (i.e. unsolved clinical exomes). Such cases were recruited to a research laboratory for further analyses, in order to potentially: (1) accelerate novel disease gene discovery; (2) increase the molecular diagnostic yield of whole exome sequencing (WES); and (3) gain insight into the genetic mechanisms of disease. Pilot project data included 74 families, consisting mostly of parent-offspring trios. Analyses performed on a research basis employed both WES from additional family members and complementary bioinformatics approaches and protocols. Results: Analysis of all possible modes of Mendelian inheritance, focusing on both single nucleotide variants (SNV) and copy number variant (CNV) alleles, yielded a likely contributory variant in 36% (27/74) of cases. If one includes candidate genes with variants identified within a single family, a potential contributory variant was identified in a total of similar to 51% (38/74) of cases enrolled in this pilot study. The molecular diagnosis was achieved in 30/63 trios (47.6%). Besides this, the analysis workflow yielded evidence for pathogenic variants in disease-associated genes in 4/6 singleton cases (66.6%), 1/1 multiplex family involving three affected siblings, and 3/4 (75%) quartet families. Both the analytical pipeline and the collaborative efforts between the diagnostic and research laboratories provided insights that allowed recent disease gene discoveries (PURA, TANGO2, EMC1, GNB5, ATAD3A, and MIPEP) and increased the number of novel genes, defined in this study as genes identified in more than one family (DHX30 and EBF3). Conclusion: An efficient genomics pipeline in which clinical sequencing in a diagnostic laboratory is followed by the detailed reanalysis of unsolved cases in a research environment, supplemented with WES data from additional family members, and subject to adjuvant bioinformatics analyses including relaxed variant filtering parameters in informatics pipelines, can enhance the molecular diagnostic yield and provide mechanistic insights into Mendelian disorders. Implementing these approaches requires collaborative clinical molecular diagnostic and research efforts.

AB  - Advances in high throughput, next generation sequencing technologies have allowed an in-depth examination of biological environments and phenomena, and are particularly useful for culture-independent microbial community studies. Recently the use of RNA for metatranscriptomic studies has been used to elucidate the role of active microbes in the environment. Extraction of RNA of appropriate quality is critical in these experiments and TRIzol reagent is often used for maintaining stability of RNA molecules during extraction. However, for studies using rumen content there is no consensus on (1) the amount of rumen digesta to use or (2) the amount of TRIzol reagent to be used in RNA extraction procedures. This study evaluated the effect of using various quantities of ground rumen digesta and of TRIzol reagent on the yield and quality of extracted RNA. It also investigated the possibility of using lower masses of solid-phase rumen digesta and lower amounts of TRIzol reagent than is used currently, for extraction of RNA for metatranscriptomic studies. We found that high quality RNA could be isolated from 2 g of ground rumen digesta sample, whilst using 0.6 g of ground matter for RNA extraction and using 3 mL (a 5: 1 TRIzol : extraction mass ratio) of TRIzol reagent. This represents a significant savings in the cost of RNA isolation. These lower masses and volumes were then applied in the RNA-Seq analysis of solid-phase rumen samples obtained from 6 Angus X Hereford beef heifers which had been fed a high forage diet (comprised of barley straw in a forage-to-concentrate ratio of 70: 30) for 102 days. A bioinformatics analysis pipeline was developed in-house that generated relative abundance values of archaea, protozoa, fungi and bacteria in the rumen and also allowed the extraction of individual rRNA variable regions that could be analyzed in downstream molecular ecology programs. The average relative abundances of rRNA transcripts of archaea, bacteria, protozoa and fungi in our samples were 1.4 +/- 0.06, 44.16 +/- 1.55, 35.38 +/- 1.64, and 16.37 +/- 0.65% respectively. This represents the first study to define the relative active contributions of these populations to the rumen ecosystem and is especially important in defining the role of the anaerobic fungi and protozoa.

AB  - Publicly available genomic data are a valuable resource for studying normal human variation and disease, but these data are often not well labeled or annotated. The lack of phenotype information for public genomic data severely limits their utility for addressing targeted biological questions. We develop an in silico phenotyping approach for predicting critical missing annotation directly from genomic measurements using well-annotated genomic and phenotypic data produced by consortia like TCGA and GTEx as training data. We apply in silico phenotyping to a set of 70 000 RNA-seq samples we recently processed on a common pipeline as part of the recount2 project. We use gene expression data to build and evaluate predictors for both biological phenotypes (sex, tissue, sample source) and experimental conditions (sequencing strategy). We demonstrate how these predictions can be used to study cross-sample properties of public genomic data, select genomic projects with specific characteristics, and perform downstream analyses using predicted phenotypes. The methods to perform phenotype prediction are available in the phenopredict R package and the predictions for recount2 are available from the recount R package. With data and phenotype information available for 70,000 human samples, expression data is available for use on a scale that was not previously feasible.

AB  - Bacterial small (sRNAs) are involved in the control of several cellular processes. Hundreds of putative sRNAs have been identified in many bacterial species through RNA sequencing. The existence of putative sRNAs is usually validated by Northern blot analysis. However, the large amount of novel putative sRNAs reported in the literature makes it impractical to validate each of them in the wet lab. In this work, we applied five machine learning approaches to construct twenty models to discriminate bona fide sRNAs from random genomic sequences in five bacterial species. Sequences were represented using seven features including free energy of their predicted secondary structure, their distances to the closest predicted promoter site and Rho-independent terminator, and their distance to the closest open reading frames (ORFs). To automatically calculate these features, we developed an sRNA Characterization Pipeline (sRNACharP). All seven features used in the classification task contributed positively to the performance of the predictive models. The best performing model obtained a median precision of 100% at 10% recall and of 64% at 40% recall across all five bacterial species, and it outperformed previous published approaches on two benchmark datasets in terms of precision and recall. Our results indicate that even though there is limited sRNA sequence conservation across different bacterial species, there are intrinsic features in the genomic context of sRNAs that are conserved across taxa. We show that these features are utilized by machine learning approaches to learn a species-independent model to prioritize bona fide bacterial sRNAs.

AB  - Breast cancer is a complex heterogeneous disease. Common hallmark features of cancer can be found. Their origin may be traced back to their intricate relationships governing regulatory programs during the development of this disease. To unveil distinctive features of the transcriptional regulation program in breast cancer, a pipeline for RNA-seq analysis in 780 breast cancer and 101 healthy breast samples, at gene expression and network level, was implemented. Inter-chromosomal relationships between genes resulted strikingly scarce in a cancer network, in comparison to its healthy counterpart. We suggest that inter-chromosomal regulation loss may be a novel feature in breast cancer. Additional evidence was obtained by independent validation in microarray and Hi-C data as well as supplementary computational analyses. Functional analysis showed upregulation in processes related to cell cycle and division; while migration, adhesion and cell-to-cell communication, were downregulated. Both the BRCA1 DNA repairing signalling and the Estrogen-mediated G1/S phase entry pathways were found upregulated. In addition, a synergistic underexpression of the.-protocadherin complex, located at Chr5q31 is also shown. This region has previously been reported to be hypermethylated in breast cancer. These findings altogether provide further evidence for the central role of transcriptional regulatory programs in shaping malignant phenotypes.

AB  - PURPOSE. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) describes a complex group of inherited retinal dystrophies with almost 300 reported genes and loci. We investigated the genetic etiology of autosomal recessive RP (arRP) in a large kindred with 5 affected family members, who reside on the island of Newfoundland, Canada. METHODS. Genetic linkage analysis was performed on 12 family members (Infinium Human-Omnin2.5-8 BeadChip). Whole exome sequencing analysis (Illumina HiSeq) was performed on one affected individual. A custom pipeline was applied to call, annotate, and filter variants. FishingCNV was used to scan the exome for rare copy number variants (CNVs). Candidate CNVs subsequently were visualized from microarray data (CNVPartition v. 3.1.6.). MERTK breakpoints were mapped and familial cosegregation was tested using Sanger Sequencing. RESULTS. We found strong evidence of linkage to a locus on chromosome 2 (logarithm of the odds [LOD] 4.89 [theta = 0]), at an interval encompassing the MERTK gene. Whole exome sequencing did not uncover candidate point mutations in MERTK, or other known RP genes. Subsequently, CNV analysis of the exome data and breakpoint mapping revealed a 25,218 bp deletion of MERTK, encompassing exons 6 to 8, with breakpoints in introns 5 (chr2: 112,725,292) and 8 (chr2: 112,750,421). A 48 bp insertion sequence was buried within the breakpoint; 18 bps shared homology to MIR4435-2HG and LINC00152, and 30 bp mapped to MERTK. The deletion cosegregated with arRP in the family. CONCLUSIONS. This study describes the molecular and clinical characterization of an arRP family segregating a novel 25 kb deletion of MERTK. These findings may assist clinicians in providing a diagnosis for other unsolved RP cases.

AB  - Purpose: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has revolutionized Mendelian diagnostics, however, there is no consensus on the timing of data review in undiagnosed individuals and only preliminary data on the cost-effectiveness of this technology. We aimed to assess the utility of WES data reanalysis for diagnosis in Mendelian disorders and to analyze the cost-effectiveness of this technology compared with a traditional diagnostic pathway. Methods: WES was applied to a cohort of 54 patients from 37 families with a variety of Mendelian disorders to identify the genetic etiology. Reanalysis was performed after 12 months with an improved WES diagnostic pipeline. A comparison was made between costs of a modeled WES pathway and a traditional diagnostic pathway in a cohort with intellectual disability (ID). Results: Reanalysis of WES data at 12 months improved diagnostic success from 30 to 41% due to interim publication of disease genes, expanded phenotype data from referrer, and an improved bioinformatics pipeline. Cost analysis on the ID cohort showed average cost savings of US$586 (AU$782) for each additional diagnosis. Conclusion: Early application of WES in Mendelian disorders is cost-effective and reanalysis of an undiagnosed individual at a 12-month time point increases total diagnoses by 11%.

AB  - Nowadays, the analysis of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data has become the standard method for quantifying the levels of gene expression. In RNA-seq experiments, the mapping of short reads to a reference genome or transcriptome is considered a crucial step that remains as one of the most time-consuming. With the steady development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, unprecedented amounts of genomic data introduce significant challenges in terms of storage, processing and downstream analysis. As cost and throughput continue to improve, there is a growing need for new software solutions that minimize the impact of increasing data volume on RNA read alignment. In this work we introduce HSRA, a Big Data tool that takes advantage of the MapReduce programming model to extend the multithreading capabilities of a state-of-the-art spliced read aligner for RNA-seq data (HISAT2) to distributed memory systems such as multi-core clusters or cloud platforms. HSRA has been built upon the Hadoop MapReduce framework and supports both single- and paired-end reads from FASTQ/FASTA datasets, providing output alignments in SAM format. The design of HSRA has been carefully optimized to avoid the main limitations and major causes of inefficiency found in previous Big Data mapping tools, which cannot fully exploit the raw performance of the underlying aligner. On a 16-node multi-core cluster, HSRA is on average 2.3 times faster than previous Hadoop-based tools. Source code in Java as well as a user's guide are publicly available for download at http://hsra.dec.udc.es.

AB  - Objective: Reliable biomarkers associated with aggressiveness of non-functioning gonadotroph adenomas (GAs) are lacking. As the growth of tumor remnants is highly variable, molecular markers for growth potential prediction are necessary. We hypothesized that fast-and slow-growing GAs present different gene expression profiles and reliable biomarkers for tumor growth potential could be identified, focusing on the specific role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Design and methods: Eight GAs selected for RNA sequencing were equally divided into fast-and slow-growing group by the tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) median (27.75 months). Data were analyzed by tophat2, cufflinks and cummeRbund pipeline. 40 genes were selected for RT-qPCR validation in 20 GAs based on significance, fold-change and pathway analyses. The effect of silencing MTDH (metadherin) and EMCN (endomucin) on in vitro migration of human adenoma cells was evaluated. Results: 350 genes were significantly differentially expressed (282 genes upregulated and 68 downregulated in the fast group, P-adjusted <0.05). Among 40 selected genes, 11 showed associations with TVDT (-0.669<R<-0.46, P < 0.05). These were PCDH18, UNC5D, EMCN, MYO1B, GPM6A and six EMT-related genes (SPAG9, SKIL, MTDH, HOOK1, CNOT6L and PRKACB). MTDH, but not EMCN, demonstrated involvement in cell migration and association with EMT markers. Conclusions: Fast-and slow-growing GAs present different gene expression profiles, and genes related to EMT have higher expression in fast-growing tumors. In addition to MTDH, identified as an important contributor to aggressiveness, the other genes might represent markers for tumor growth potential and possible targets for drug therapy.

AB  - Background: Genetically engineered mice (GEM) are essential tools for understanding gene function and disease modeling. Historically, gene targeting was first done in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the 129 family of inbred strains, leading to a mixed background or congenic mice when crossed with C57BL/6 mice. Depending on the number of backcrosses and breeding strategies, genomic segments from 129-derived ESCs can be introgressed into the C57BL/6 genome, establishing a unique genetic makeup that needs characterization in order to obtain valid conclusions from experiments using GEM lines. Currently, SNP genotyping is used to detect the extent of 129-derived ESC genome introgression into C57BL/6 recipients; however, it fails to detect novel/rare variants. Results: Here, we present a computational pipeline implemented in the Galaxy platform and in BASH/R script to determine genetic introgression of GEM using next generation sequencing data (NGS), such as whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq. The pipeline includes strategies to uncover variants linked to a targeted locus, genome-wide variant visualization, and the identification of potential modifier genes. Although these methods apply to congenic mice, they can also be used to describe variants fixed by genetic drift. As a proof of principle, we analyzed publicly available RNA-Seq data from five congenic knockout (KO) lines and our own RNA-Seq data from the Sall2 KO line. Additionally, we performed target validation using several genetics approaches. Conclusions: We revealed the impact of the 129-derived ESC genome introgression on gene expression, predicted potential modifier genes, and identified potential phenotypic interference in KO lines. Our results demonstrate that our new approach is an effective method to determine genetic introgression of GEM.

AB  - Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive malignancy of the bile ducts, with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Here, we describe the integrated analysis of somatic mutations, RNA expression, copy number, and DNA methylation by The Cancer Genome Atlas of a set of predominantly intrahepatic CCA cases and propose a molecular classification scheme. We identified an IDH mutant-enriched subtype with distinct molecular features including low expression of chromatin modifiers, elevated expression of mitochondrial genes, and increased mitochondrial DNA copy number. Leveraging the multi-platform data, we observed that ARID1A exhibited DNA hypermethy-lation and decreased expression in the IDH mutant subtype. More broadly, we found that IDH mutations are associated with an expanded histological spectrum of liver tumors with molecular features that stratify with CCA. Our studies reveal insights into the molecular pathogenesis and heterogeneity of cholangiocarcinoma and provide classification information of potential therapeutic significance.

AB  - The perfect method to discover and validate actionable somatic variants in cancer has not yet been developed, yet significant progress has been made toward this goal. There have been huge increases in the throughput and cost of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing technologies that have led to the burgeoning possibility of using sequencing data in clinical settings. Discovery of somatic mutations is relatively simple and has been improved recently due to laboratory methods optimization, bioinformatics algorithms development, and the expansion of various databases of population genomic information. Tiered systems of evidence evaluation are currently being used to classify genomic variants for clinicians to more rapidly and accurately determine actionability of these aberrations. These efforts are complicated by the intricacies of communicating sequencing results to physicians and supporting its biological relevance, emphasizing the need for increasing education of clinicians and administrators, and the ongoing development of ethical standards for dealing with incidental results. This chapter will focus on general aspects of DNA and RNA tumor sequencing technologies, data analysis and interpretation, assessment of biological and clinical relevance of genomic aberrations, ethical aspects of germline sequencing, and how these factors impact cancer personalized care.

AB  - Although many insects are associated with obligate bacterial endosymbionts, the mechanisms by which these host/endosymbiont associations are regulated remain mysterious. While microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recently identified as regulators of host/microbe interactions, including host/pathogen and host/facultative endosymbiont interactions, the role miRNAs may play in mediating host/obligate endosymbiont interactions is virtually unknown. Here, we identified conserved miRNAs that potentially mediate symbiotic interactions between aphids and their obligate endosymbiont, Buchnera aphidicola. Using small RNA sequence data from Myzus persicae and Acyrthosiphon pisum, we annotated 93 M.persicae and 89 A.pisum miRNAs, among which 69 were shared. We found 14 miRNAs that were either highly expressed in aphid bacteriome, the Buchnera-housing tissue, or differentially expressed in bacteriome vs. gut, a non-Buchnera-housing tissue. Strikingly, 10 of these 14 miRNAs have been implicated previously in other host/microbe interaction studies. Investigating the interaction networks of these miRNAs using a custom computational pipeline, we identified 103 miRNA::mRNA interactions shared between M.persicae and A.pisum. Functional annotation of the shared mRNA targets revealed only two over-represented cluster of orthologous group categories: amino acid transport and metabolism, and signal transduction mechanisms. Our work supports arole for miRNAs in mediating host/symbiont interactions between aphids and theirobligate endosymbiont Buchnera. In addition, our results highlight the probable importance of signal transduction mechanisms to host/endosymbiont coevolution.

AB  - Background: Alternative splicing is a ubiquitous post-transcriptional regulation mechanism in most eukaryotic genes. Aberrant splicing isoforms and abnormal isoform ratios can contribute to cancer development. Kinase genes are key regulators of multiple cellular processes. Many kinases are found to be oncogenic and have been intensively investigated in the study of cancer and drugs. RNA-Seq provides a powerful technology for genome-wide study of alternative splicing in cancer besides the conventional gene expression profiling. But this potential has not been fully demonstrated yet. Methods: We characterized the transcriptome profile of prostate cancer using RNA-Seq data from viewpoints of both differential expression and differential splicing, with an emphasis on kinase genes and their splicing variations. We built a pipeline to conduct differential expression and differential splicing analysis, followed by functional enrichment analysis. We performed kinase domain analysis to identify the functionally important candidate kinase gene in prostate cancer, and calculated the expression levels of isoforms to explore the function of isoform switching of kinase genes in prostate cancer. Results: We identified distinct gene groups from differential expression and splicing analyses, which suggested that alternative splicing adds another level to gene expression regulation. Enriched GO terms of differentially expressed and spliced kinase genes were found to play different roles in regulation of cellular metabolism. Function analysis on differentially spliced kinase genes showed that differentially spliced exons of these genes are significantly enriched in protein kinase domains. Among them, we found that gene CDK5 has isoform switching between prostate cancer and benign tissues, which may affect cancer development by changing androgen receptor (AR) phosphorylation. The observation was validated in another RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines. Conclusions: Our work characterized the expression and splicing profiles of kinase genes in prostate cancer and proposed a hypothetical model on isoform switching of CDK5 and AR phosphorylation in prostate cancer. These findings bring new understanding to the role of alternatively spliced kinases in prostate cancer and also demonstrate the use of RNA-Seq data in studying alternative splicing in cancer.

AB  - What enables us to acquire and use our knowledge? The classical declarative memory system with the hippocampus at its core appears not sufficient to explain knowledge acquisition and retrieval satisfactorily. Recent evidence suggests an extension of this classical model by assigning the medial prefrontal cortex a particular, yet not fully defined role in long-term memory. This chapter will integrate data derived from experiments with rodents and humans providing the basis for an extended declarative memory system that includes the medial prefrontal cortex. Here, I discuss how the medial prefrontal cortex, interacting with the medial temporal lobe, posterior representational areas and specific subcortical structures, may help obtain, integrate and apply our knowledge for long-term usage.

AB  - Background: An open challenge in translational bioinformatics is the analysis of sequenced metagenomes from various environmental samples. Of course, several studies demonstrated the 16S ribosomal RNA could be considered as a barcode for bacteria classification at the genus level, but till now it is hard to identify the correct composition of metagenomic data from RNA-seq short-read data. 16S short-read data are generated using two next generation sequencing technologies, i.e. whole genome shotgun (WGS) and amplicon (AMP); typically, the former is filtered to obtain short-reads belonging to a 16S shotgun (SG), whereas the latter take into account only some specific 16S hypervariable regions. The above mentioned two sequencing technologies, SG and AMP, are used alternatively, for this reason in this work we propose a deep learning approach for taxonomic classification of metagenomic data, that can be employed for both of them. Results: To test the proposed pipeline, we simulated both SG and AMP short-reads, from 1000 16S full-length sequences. Then, we adopted a k-mer representation to map sequences as vectors into a numerical space. Finally, we trained two different deep learning architecture, i.e., convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep belief network (DBN), obtaining a trained model for each taxon. We tested our proposed methodology to find the best parameters configuration, and we compared our results against the classification performances provided by a reference classifier for bacteria identification, known as RDP classifier. We outperformed the RDP classifier at each taxonomic level with both architectures. For instance, at the genus level, both CNN and DBN reached 91.3% of accuracy with AMP short-reads, whereas RDP classifier obtained 83.8% with the same data. Conclusions: In this work, we proposed a 16S short-read sequences classification technique based on k-mer representation and deep learning architecture, in which each taxon (from phylum to genus) generates a classification model. Experimental results confirm the proposed pipeline as a valid approach for classifying bacteria sequences; for this reason, our approach could be integrated into the most common tools for metagenomic analysis. According to obtained results, it can be successfully used for classifying both SG and AMP data.

AB  - Cancer is thought to arise through the accumulation of genomic aberrations evolving under Darwinian selection. However, it remains unclear when the aberrations associated with metastasis emerge during tumor evolution. Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary eye cancer and frequently leads to metastatic death, which is strongly linked to BAP1 mutations. Accordingly, UM is ideally suited for studying the clonal evolution of metastatic competence. Here we analyze sequencing data from 151 primary UM samples using a customized bioinformatic pipeline, to improve detection of BAP1 mutations and infer the clonal relationships among genomic aberrations. Strikingly, we find BAP1 mutations and other canonical genomic aberrations usually arise in an early punctuated burst, followed by neutral evolution extending to the time of clinical detection. This implies that the metastatic proclivity of UM is "set in stone" early in tumor evolution and may explain why advances in primary treatment have not improved survival.

AB  - Noncoding transcription is a defining feature of active enhancers, linking transcription factor (TF) binding to the molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression. To determine the relationship between enhancer activity and biological outcomes in breast cancers, we profiled the transcriptomes (using GRO-seq and RNA-seq) and epigenomes (using ChIP-seq) of 11 different human breast cancer cell lines representing five major molecular subtypes of breast cancer, as well as two immortalized ("normal") human breast cell lines. In addition, we developed a robust and unbiased computational pipeline that simultaneously identifies putative subtype-specific enhancers and their cognate TFs by integrating the magnitude of enhancer transcription, TF mRNA expression levels, TF motif P-values, and enrichment of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. When applied across the 13 different cell lines noted above, the Total Functional Score of Enhancer Elements (TFSEE) identified key breast cancer subtype-specific TFs that act at transcribed enhancers to dictate gene expression patterns determining growth outcomes, including Forkhead TFs, FOSLI, and PLAG1. FOSLI, a Fos family TF, (1) is highly enriched at the enhancers of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, (2) acts as a key regulator of the proliferation and viability of TNBC cells, but not Luminal A cells, and (3) is associated with a poor prognosis in TNBC breast cancer patients. Taken together, our results validate our enhancer identification pipeline and reveal that enhancers transcribed in breast cancer cells direct critical gene regulatory networks that promote pathogenesis.

AB  - Background: Since the proposal of Brachypodium distachyon as a model for the grasses, over 500 Bdi-miRNAs have been annotated in miRBase making Brachypodium second in number only to rice. Other monocots, such as switchgrass, are completely absent from the miRBase database. While a significant number of miRNAs have been identified which are highly conserved across plants, little research has been done with respect to the conservation of miRNA targets. Plant responses to abiotic stresses are regulated by diverse pathways many of which involve miRNAs; however, it can be difficult to identify miRNA guided gene regulation when the miRNA is not the primary regulator of the target mRNA. Results: To investigate miRNA target conservation and stress response involvement, a set of PARE (Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends) libraries totaling over two billion reads was constructed and sequenced from Brachypodium, switchgrass, and sorghum representing the first report of RNA degradome data from the latter two species. Analysis of this data provided not only PARE evidence for miRNA guided cleavage of over 7000 predicted target mRNAs in Brachypodium, but also evidence for miRNA guided cleavage of over 1000 homologous transcripts in sorghum and switchgrass. A pipeline was constructed to compare RNA-seq and PARE data made from Brachypodium plants exposed to various abiotic stress conditions. This resulted in the identification of 44 miRNA targets which exhibit stress regulated cleavage. Time course experiments were performed to reveal the relationship between miR393ab, miR169a, miR394ab, and their respective targets throughout the first 36 h of the cold stress response in Brachypodium. Conclusions: Knowledge gained from this study provides considerable insight into the RNA degradomes and the breadth of miRNA target conservation among these three species. Additionally, associations of a number of miRNAs and target mRNAs with the stress responses have been revealed which could aid in the development of stress tolerant transgenic crops.

AB  - Background: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare and heterogeneous genetic syndrome. It is associated with short stature, bone marrow failure, high predisposition to cancer, microcephaly and congenital malformation. Many genes have been associated with FA. Previously, two adult patients with biallelic pathogenic variant in Breast Cancer 1 gene (BRCA1) had been identified in Fanconi Anemia-like condition. Clinical report: The proband was a 2.5 year-old girl with severe short stature, microcephaly, neurodevelopmental delay, congenital heart disease and dysmorphic features. Her parents were third degree cousins. Routine screening tests for short stature was normal. Methods: We conducted whole exome sequencing (WES) of the proband and used an analysis pipeline to identify rare nonsynonymous genetic variants that cause short stature. Results: We identified a homozygous loss-of-function BRCA1 mutation (c.2709T > A; p. Cys903*), which promotes the loss of critical domains of the protein. Cytogenetic study with DEB showed an increased chromosomal breakage. We screened heterozygous parents of the index case for cancer and we detected, in her mother, a metastatic adenocarcinoma in an axillar lymph node with probable primary site in the breast. Conclusion: It is possible to consolidate the FA-like phenotype associated with biallelic loss-of-function BRCA1, characterized by microcephaly, short stature, developmental delay, dysmorphic face features and cancer predisposition. In our case, the WES allowed to establish the genetic cause of short stature in the context of a chromosome instability syndrome. An identification of BRCA1 mutations in our patient allowed precise genetic counseling and also triggered cancer screening for the patient and her family members.

AB  - By sequencing the exomes of distantly related individuals in multiplex families, rare mutational and structural changes to coding DNA can be characterized and their relationship to disease risk can be assessed. Recently, several rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were associated with an increased risk of nonsyndromic oral cleft, highlighting the importance of rare sequence variants in oral clefts and illustrating the strength of family-based study designs. However, the extent to which rare deletions in coding regions of the genome occur and contribute to risk of nonsyndromic clefts is not well understood. To identify putative structural variants underlying risk, we developed a pipeline for rare hemizygous deletions in families from whole exome sequencing and statistical inference based on rare variant sharing. Among 56 multiplex families with 115 individuals, we identified 53 regions with one or more rare hemizygous deletions. We found 45 of the 53 regions contained rare deletions occurring in only one family member. Members of the same family shared a rare deletion in only eight regions. We also devised a scalable global test for enrichment of shared rare deletions.

AB  - In this article, we propose a new statistical method-MutRSeq-for detecting differentially expressed single nucleotide variants (SNVs) based on RNA-seq data. Specifically, we focus on nonsynonymous mutations and employ a hierarchical likelihood approach to jointly model observed mutation events as well as read count measurements from RNA-seq experiments. We then introduce a likelihood ratio-based test statistic, which detects changes not only in overall expression levels, but also in allele-specific expression patterns. In addition, this method can jointly test multiple mutations in one gene/pathway. The simulation studies suggest that the proposed method achieves better power than a few competitors under a range of different settings. In the end, we apply this method to a breast cancer data set and identify genes with nonsynonymous mutations differentially expressed between the triple negative breast cancer tumors and other subtypes of breast cancer tumors.

AB  - The proliferative darkening syndrome (PDS) is a lethal disease of brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) which occurs in several alpine Bavarian limestone rivers. Because mortality can reach 100%, PDS is a serious threat for affected fish populations. Recently, Kuehn and colleagues reported that a high throughput RNA sequencing approach identified a piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) as a causative agent of PDS. We investigated samples from PDS-affected fish obtained from two exposure experiments performed at the river Iller in 2008 and 2009. Using a RT-qPCR and a well-established next-generation RNA sequencing pipeline for pathogen detection, PRV-specific RNA was not detectable in PDS fish from 2009. In contrast, PRV RNA was readily detectable in several organs from diseased fish in 2008. However, similar virus loads were detectable in the control fish which were not exposed to Iller water and did not show any signs of the disease. Therefore, we conclude that PRV is not the causative agent of PDS of brown trout in the rhithral region of alpine Bavarian limestone rivers. The abovementioned study by Kuehn used only samples from the exposure experiment from 2008 and detected a subclinical PRV bystander infection. Work is ongoing to identify the causative agent of PDS.

AB  - Composting is viewed as one of the primary methods to treat organic wastes. Co-composting may improve the efficiency of this treatment by establishing the most suitable conditions for decomposers than those present in the individual wastes. Given that bacteria and fungi are the driving agents of composting, information about the composition of their communities and dynamics during composting may improve reproducibility, performance and quality of the final compost as well as help to evaluate the potential human health risk and the choice of the most appropriate application procedure. In this study, the co-composting of mixtures containing two similar components (organic fraction of municipal solid waste and sawdust polluted by oil) and one discriminate component (sewage sludges of different origin) were investigated. Bacterial and fungal community successions in the two mixtures were analyzed during the composting process by determining the change in their structural dynamics using qPCR and 454 pyrosequencing methods in a lab experiment for a period of 270 days. During the initial composting stage, the number of 16S bacterial copies was (3.0 +/- 0.2) x 10(6) and (0.4 +/- 0.0) x 10(7) g(-1), and the Rhodospiralles and Lactobacialles orders dominated. Fungal communities had (2.9 +/- 0.0) x 10(5) and (6.1 +/- 0.2) x10(5) ITS copies g(-1), and the Saccharomycetales order dominated. At the end of the thermophilic stage on the 30 th day of composting, bacterial and fungal communities underwent significant changes: dominants changed and their relative abundance decreased. Typical compost residents included Flavobacteriales, Chitinophagaceae and Bacterioidetes for bacteria and Microascaceae, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Agaricomycetes for fungi. During the later composting stages, the dominating taxa of both bacterial and fungal communities remained, while their relative abundance decreased. In accordance with the change in the dominating OTUs, it was concluded that the dynamics of the bacterial and fungal communities were not similar. Analysis by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that the bacterial communities of the two composts became progressively more similar; a similar trend was followed by the fungal community.

AB  - The desiccation tolerant bryophyte Bryum argenteum is an important component of desert biological soil crusts (BSCs) and is emerging as a model system for studying vegetative desiccation tolerance. Here we present and analyze the hydration-dehydration-rehydration transcriptomes in B. argenteum to establish a desiccation-tolerance transcriptomic atlas. B. argenteum gametophores representing five different hydration stages (hydrated (H0), dehydrated for 2 h (D2), 24 h (D24), then rehydrated for 2 h (R2) and 48 h (R48)), were sampled for transcriptome analyses. Illumina high throughput RNASeq technology was employed and generated more than 488.46 million reads. An in-house de novo transcriptome assembly optimization pipeline based on Trinity assembler was developed to obtain a reference Hydration-Dehydration-Rehydration (H-D-R) transcriptome comprising of 76,206 transcripts, with an N50 of 2,016 bp and average length of 1,222 bp. Comprehensive transcription factor (TF) annotation discovered 978 TFs in 62 families, among which 404 TFs within 40 families were differentially expressed upon dehydration-rehydration. Pfam term enrichment analysis revealed 172 protein families/domains were significantly associated with the H-D-R cycle and confirmed early rehydration (i.e. the R2 stage) as exhibiting the maximum stress-induced changes in gene expression.

AB  - Background: Copy number variations (CNVs) are the main genetic structural variations in cancer genome. Detecting CNVs in genetic exome region is efficient and cost-effective in identifying cancer associated genes. Many tools had been developed accordingly and yet these tools lack of reliability because of high false negative rate, which is intrinsically caused by genome exonic bias. Results: To provide an alternative option, here, we report Anaconda, a comprehensive pipeline that allows flexible integration of multiple CNV-calling methods and systematic annotation of CNVs in analyzing WES data. Just by one command, Anaconda can generate CNV detection result by up to four CNV detecting tools. Associated with comprehensive annotation analysis of genes involved in shared CNV regions, Anaconda is able to deliver a more reliable and useful report in assistance with CNV-associate cancer researches. Conclusion: Anaconda package and manual can be freely accessed at http://mcg. ustc. edu. cn/bsc/ANACONDA/.

AB  - A Summary: The single-molecule real-time (SMRT) isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) based on Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) platform has received increasing attention for its ability to explore full-length isoforms. Thus, comprehensive tools for Iso-Seq bioinformatics analysis are extremely useful. Here, we present a one-stop solution for Iso-Seq analysis, called PRAPI to analyze alternative transcription initiation (ATI), alternative splicing (AS), alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA), natural antisense transcripts (NAT), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) comprehensively. PRAPI is capable of combining Iso-Seq full-length isoforms with short read data, such as RNA-Seq or polyadenylation site sequencing (PAS-seq) for differential expression analysis of NAT, AS, APA and circRNAs. Furthermore, PRAPI can annotate new genes and correct mis-annotated genes when gene annotation is available. Finally, PRAPI generates high-quality vector graphics to visualize and highlight the Iso-Seq results.

AB  - Motivation: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows whole transcriptome profiling of thousands of individual cells, enabling the molecular exploration of tissues at the cellular level. Such analytical capacity is of great interest to many research groups in the world, yet these groups often lack the expertise to handle complex scRNA-seq datasets. Results: We developed a fully integrated, web-based platform aimed at the complete analysis of scRNA-seq data post genome alignment: from the parsing, filtering and normalization of the input count data files, to the visual representation of the data, identification of cell clusters, differentially expressed genes (including cluster-specific marker genes), and functional gene set enrichment. This Automated Single-cell Analysis Pipeline (ASAP) combines a wide range of commonly used algorithms with sophisticated visualization tools. Compared with existing scRNA-seq analysis platforms, researchers (including those lacking computational expertise) are able to interact with the data in a straightforward fashion and in real time. Furthermore, given the overlap between scRNAseq and bulk RNA-seq analysis workflows, ASAP should conceptually be broadly applicable to any RNA-seq dataset. As a validation, we demonstrate how we can use ASAP to simply reproduce the results from a single-cell study of 91 mouse cells involving five distinct cell types.

AB  - Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) Heterodera glycines is an obligate parasite that relies on the secretion of effector proteins to manipulate host cellular processes that favor the formation of a feeding site within host roots to ensure its survival. The sequence complexity and co-evolutionary forces acting upon these effectors remain unknown. Here we generated a de novo transcriptome assembly representing the early life stages of SCN in both a compatible and an incompatible host interaction to facilitate global effector mining efforts in the absence of an available annotated SCN genome. We then employed a dual effector prediction strategy coupling a newly developed nematode effector prediction tool, N-Preffector, with a traditional secreted protein prediction pipeline to uncover a suite of novel effector candidates. Our analysis distinguished between effectors that co-evolve with the host genotype and those conserved by the pathogen to maintain a core function in parasitism and demonstrated that alternative splicing is one mechanism used to diversify the effector pool. In addition, we confirmed the presence of viral and microbial inhabitants with molecular sequence information. This transcriptome represents the most comprehensive whole-nematode sequence currently available for SCN and can be used as a tool for annotation of expected genome assemblies.

A variety of experimental approaches have been developed to characterize the RNAs associated with RBPs in vitro as well as in vivo. Our laboratory developed Photoactivatable-Ribonucleoside-Enhanced Cross-Linking and Immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP), which in combination with next-generation sequencing enables the identification of RNA targets of RBPs at a nucleotide-level resolution. Here we present an updated and condensed step-by-step PAR-CLIP protocol followed by the description of our RNA-seq data analysis pipeline.

AB  - Background: One of the most crucial steps in high-throughput sequence-based microbiome studies is the taxonomic assignment of sequences belonging to operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Without taxonomic classification, functional and biological information of microbial communities cannot be inferred or interpreted. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA is the conventional marker region for fungal community studies. While bioinformatics pipelines that cluster reads into OTUs have received much attention in the literature, less attention has been given to the taxonomic classification of these sequences, upon which biological inference is dependent. Results: Here we compare how three common fungal OTU taxonomic assignment tools (RDP Classifier, UTAX, and SINTAX) handle ITS fungal sequence data. The classification power, defined as the proportion of assigned OTUs at a given taxonomic rank, varied among the classifiers. Classifiers were generally consistent (assignment of the same taxonomy to a given OTU) across datasets and ranks; a small number of OTUs were assigned unique classifications across programs. We developed CONSTAX (CONSensus TAXonomy), a Python tool that compares taxonomic classifications of the three programs and merges them into an improved consensus taxonomy. This tool also produces summary classification outputs that are useful for downstream analyses. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that independent taxonomy assignment tools classify unique members of the fungal community, and greater classification power is realized by generating consensus taxonomy of available classifiers with CONSTAX.

AB  - Small GTPases (sGTPases) are critical switch-like regulators that mediate several important cellular functions and are often mutated in human cancers. They are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which specifically catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP. GEFs coordinate signaling networks in normal cells, and are frequently deregulated in cancers. sGTPase signaling pathways are complex and interconnected; however, most GEF assays do not reveal such complexity. In this Communication, we describe the development of a unique real-time NMR-based multiplexed GEF assay that employs distinct isotopic labeling schemes for each sGTPase protein to enable simultaneous observation of six proteins of interest. We monitor nucleotide exchange of KRas, Rheb, RalB, RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1 in a single system, and assayed the activities of GEFs in lysates of cultured human cells and 3D organoids derived from pancreatic cancer patients. We observed potent activation of RhoA by lysates of HEK293a cells transfected with GEF-H1, along with weak stimulation of Rac1, which we showed is indirect. Our functional analyses of pancreatic cancer-derived organoids revealed higher GEF activity for RhoA than other sGTPases, in line with RNA-seq data indicating high expression of RhoA-specific GEFs.

AB  - Background: Chinese giant salamander (CGS) is the largest extant amphibian species in the world. Owing to its evolutionary position and four peculiar phenomenon of life (longevity, starvation tolerance, regenerative ability, and hatch without sunshine), it is an invaluable model species for research. However, lack of genomic resources leads to fewer study progresses in these fields, due to its huge genome of similar to 50 GB making it extremely difficult to be assembled. Results: We reported the sequenced transcriptome of more than 20 tissues from adult CGS using Illumina Hiseq 2000 technology, and a total of 93 366 no-redundancy transcripts with a mean length of 1326 bp were obtained. We developed for the first time an efficient pipeline to construct a high-quality reference gene set of CGS and obtained 26 135 coding genes. BUSCO and homologous assessment showed that our assembly captured 70.6% of vertebrate universal single-copy orthologs, and this coding gene set had a higher proportion of completeness CDS with comparable quality of the protein sets of Tibetan frog. Conclusions: These highest quality data will provide a valuable reference gene set to the subsequent research of CGS. In addition, our strategy of de novo transcriptome assembly and protein identification is applicable to similar studies.

AB  - Alternative splicing plays an important role in numerous cellular processes and aberrant splice decisions are associated with cancer. Although some studies point to a regulation of alternative splicing and its effector mechanisms in a time-dependent manner, the extent and consequences of such a regulation remains poorly understood. In the present work, we investigated the time-dependent production of isoforms in two Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines of different progression stages (HD-MY-Z, stage IIIb and L-1236, stage IV) compared to a B lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL-HO) with a focus on tumour necrosis factor (TNF) pathway-related elements. For this, we used newly generated time-course RNA-sequencing data from the mentioned cell lines and applied a computational pipeline to identify genes with isoform-switching behaviour in time. We analysed the temporal profiles of the identified events and evaluated in detail the potential functional implications of alterations in isoform expression for the selected top-switching genes. Our data indicate that elements within the TNF pathway undergo a time-dependent variation in isoform production with a putative impact on cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis. These include the genes TRAF1, TNFRSF12A and NFKB2. Our results point to a role of temporal alternative splicing in isoform production, which may alter the outcome of the TNF pathway and impact on tumorigenesis.

AB  - Leptosphaeria maculans, the causal agent of stem canker disease, colonizes oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in two stages: a short and early colonization stage corresponding to cotyledon or leaf colonization, and a late colonization stage during which the fungus colonizes systemically and symptomlessly the plant during several months before stem canker appears. To date, the determinants of the late colonization stage are poorly understood; L. maculans may either successfully escape plant defences, leading to stem canker development, or the plant may develop an adult-stage' resistance reducing canker incidence. To obtain an insight into these determinants, we performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) pilot project comparing fungal gene expression in infected cotyledons and in symptomless or necrotic stems. Despite the low fraction of fungal material in infected stems, sufficient fungal transcripts were detected and a large number of fungal genes were expressed, thus validating the feasibility of the approach. Our analysis showed that all avirulence genes previously identified are under-expressed during stem colonization compared with cotyledon colonization. A validation RNA-seq experiment was then performed to investigate the expression of candidate effector genes during systemic colonization. Three hundred and seven late' effector candidates, under-expressed in the early colonization stage and over-expressed in the infected stems, were identified. Finally, our analysis revealed a link between the regulation of expression of effectors and their genomic location: the late' effector candidates, putatively involved in systemic colonization, are located in gene-rich genomic regions, whereas the early' effector genes, over-expressed in the early colonization stage, are located in gene-poor regions of the genome.

AB  - New de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation methods provide an incredible opportunity to study the transcriptome of organisms that lack an assembled and annotated genome. There are currently a number of de novo transcriptome assembly methods, but it has been difficult to evaluate the quality of these assemblies. In order to assess the quality of the transcriptome assemblies, we composed a workflow of multiple quality check measurements that in combination provide a clear evaluation of the assembly performance. We presented novel transcriptome assemblies and functional annotations for Pacific Whiteleg Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamet), a mariculture species with great national and international interest, and no solid transcriptome/genome reference. We examined Pacific Whiteleg transcriptome assemblies via multiple metrics, and provide an improved gene annotation. Our investigations show that assessing the quality of an assembly purely based on the assembler's statistical measurements can be misleading; we propose a hybrid approach that consists of statistical quality checks and further biological-based evaluations.

AB  - Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing is an invaluable assay for identifying the genomic binding sites of transcription factors. However, transcription factors rarely bind chromatin alone but often bind together with other cofactors, forming protein complexes. Here, we describe a computational method that integrates multiple ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets to discover protein complexes and determine their role as activators or repressors. This chapter outlines a detailed computational pipeline for discovering and predicting binding partners from ChIP-seq data and inferring their role in regulating gene expression. This work aims at developing hypotheses about gene regulation via binding partners and deciphering the combinatorial nature of DNA-binding proteins.

AB  - Musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries are complex phenotypes with genetics being one of many proposed risk factors. Case-control association studies using the candidate gene approach have predominately been used to identify risk loci for these injuries. However, the ability to identify all risk conferring variants using this approach alone is unlikely. Therefore, this study aimed to further define the genetic profile of these injuries using an integrated omics approach involving whole exome sequencing and a customised analyses pipeline. The exomes of ten exemplar asymptomatic controls and ten exemplar cases with Achilles tendinopathy were individually sequenced using a platform that included the coverage of the untranslated regions and miRBase miRNA genes. Approximately 200 000 variants were identified in the sequenced samples. Previous research was used to guide a targeted analysis of the genes encoding the tenascin-C (TNC) glycoprotein and the alpha 1 chain of type XXVII collagen (COL27A1) located on chromosome 9. Selection of variants within these genes were; however, not predetermined but based on a tiered filtering strategy. Four variants in TNC (rs1061494, rs1138545, rs2104772 and rs1061495) and three variants in the upstream COL27A1 gene (rs2567706, rs2241671 and rs2567705) were genotyped in larger Achilles tendinopathy and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture sample groups. The CC genotype of TNC rs1061494 (C/T) was associated with the risk of Achilles tendinopathy (p = 0.018, OR: 2.5 95% CI: 1.2-5.1). Furthermore, the AA genotype of the TNC rs2104772 (A/T) variant was significantly associated with ACL ruptures in the female subgroup (p = 0.035, OR: 2.3 95% CI: 1.1-5.5). An inferred haplotype in the TNC gene was also associated with the risk of Achilles tendinopathy. These results provide a proof of concept for the use of a customised pipeline for the exploration of a larger genomic dataset. This approach, using previous research to guide a targeted analysis of the data has generated new genetic signatures in the biology of musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries.

AB  - The immunology field has invested great efforts and ingenuity to characterize the various immune cell types and elucidate their functions. However, accumulating evidence indicates that current technologies and classification schemes are limited in their ability to account for the functional heterogeneity of immune processes. Single-cell genomics hold the potential to revolutionize the way we characterize complex immune cell assemblies and study their spatial organization, dynamics, clonal distribution, pathways, function, and crosstalks. In this Perspective, we consider recent and forthcoming technological and analytical advances in single-cell genomics and the potential impact of those advances on the future of immunology research and immunotherapy.

Genes of this species, Sus scrofa, are known from experiments and predictions, and collected at the NCBI reference sequence database section. Gene reconstruction from transcribed gene evidence of RNA-seq now can accurately and completely reproduce the biological gene sets of animals and plants. Such a gene set for the pig is reported here, including human orthologs missing from current NCBI and Ensembl reference pig gene sets, additional alternate transcripts, and other improvements. Methodology for accurate and complete gene set reconstruction from RNA is used: the automated SRA2Genes pipeline of EvidentialGene project.

AB  - Motivation: Predicting the conserved secondary structure of homologous ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences is crucial for understanding RNA functions. However, fast and accurate RNA structure prediction is challenging, especially when the number and the divergence of homologous RNA increases. To address this challenge, we propose aliFreeFold, based on a novel alignment-free approach which computes a representative structure from a set of homologous RNA sequences using sub-optimal secondary structures generated for each sequence. It is based on a vector representation of sub-optimal structures capturing structure conservation signals by weighting structural motifs according to their conservation across the sub-optimal structures. Results: We demonstrate that aliFreeFold provides a good balance between speed and accuracy regarding predictions of representative structures for sets of homologous RNA compared to traditional methods based on sequence and structure alignment. We show that aliFreeFold is capable of uncovering conserved structural features fastly and effectively thanks to its weighting scheme that gives more (resp. less) importance to common (resp. uncommon) structural motifs. The weighting scheme is also shown to be capable of capturing conservation signal as the number of homologous RNA increases. These results demonstrate the ability of aliFreefold to efficiently and accurately provide interesting structural representatives of RNA families.

AB  - In recent years, protocols have been established to differentiate stem and precursor cells into more mature cell types. However, progress in this field has been hampered by difficulties to assess the differentiation status of stem cell-derived cells in an unbiased manner. Here, we present an analysis pipeline based on published data and methods to quantify the degree of differentiation and to identify transcriptional control factors explaining differences from the intended target cells or tissues. The pipeline requires RNA-Seq or gene array data of the stem cell starting population, derived 'mature' cells and primary target cells or tissue. It consists of a principal component analysis to represent global expression changes and to identify possible problems of the dataset that require special attention, such as: batch effects; clustering techniques to identify gene groups with similar features; over-representation analysis to characterize biological motifs and transcriptional control factors of the identified gene clusters; and metagenes as well as gene regulatory networks for quantitative cell-type assessment and identification of influential transcription factors. Possibilities and limitations of the analysis pipeline are illustrated using the example of human embryonic stem cell and human induced pluripotent cells to generate 'hepatocyte-like cells'. The pipeline quantifies the degree of incomplete differentiation as well as remaining stemness and identifies unwanted features, such as colon-and fibroblast-associated gene clusters that are absent in real hepatocytes but typically induced by currently available differentiation protocols. Finally, transcription factors responsible for incomplete and unwanted differentiation are identified. The proposed method is widely applicable and allows an unbiased and quantitative assessment of stem cell-derived cells. This article is part of the theme issue 'Designer human tissue: coming to a lab near you'.

AB  - RNA microarrays and RNA-seq are nowadays standard technologies to study the transcriptional activity of cells. Most studies focus on tracking transcriptional changes caused by specific experimental conditions. Information referring to genes up-and downregulation is evaluated analyzing the behaviour of relatively large population of cells by averaging its properties. However, even assuming perfect sample homogeneity, different subpopulations of cells can exhibit diverse transcriptomic profiles, as they may follow different regulatory/signaling pathways. The purpose of this study is to provide a novel methodological scheme to account for possible internal, functional heterogeneity in homogeneous cell lines, including cancer ones. We propose a novel computational method to infer the proportion between subpopulations of cells that manifest various functional behaviour in a given sample. Our method was validated using two datasets from RNA microarray experiments. Both experiments aimed to examine cell viability in specific experimental conditions. The presented methodology can be easily extended to RNA-seq data as well as other molecular processes. Moreover, it complements standard tools to indicate most important networks from transcriptomic data and in particular could be useful in the analysis of cancer cell lines affected by biologically active compounds or drugs.

AB  - Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as a class of factors that are important for regulating development and cancer. Computational prediction of lncRNAs from ultra-deep RNA sequencing has been successful in identifying candidate lncRNAs. However, the complexity of handling and integrating different types of genomics data poses significant challenges to experimental laboratories that lack extensive genomics expertise. Result: To address this issue, we have developed lncRNA-screen, a comprehensive pipeline for computationally screening putative lncRNA transcripts over large multimodal datasets. The main objective of this work is to facilitate the computational discovery of lncRNA candidates to be further examined by functional experiments. lncRNA-screen provides a fully automated easy-to-run pipeline which performs data download, RNA-seq alignment, assembly, quality assessment, transcript filtration, novel lncRNA identification, coding potential estimation, expression level quantification, histone mark enrichment profile integration, differential expression analysis, annotation with other type of segmented data (CNVs, SNPs, Hi-C, etc.) and visualization. Importantly, lncRNA-screen generates an interactive report summarizing all interesting lncRNA features including genome browser snapshots and lncRNA-mRNA interactions based on Hi-C data. Conclusion: lncRNA-screen provides a comprehensive solution for lncRNA discovery and an intuitive interactive report for identifying promising lncRNA candidates. lncRNA-screen is available as open-source software on GitHub.

AB  - Introduction: The technological and scientific progress performed in the Human Proteome Project (HPP) has provided to the scientific community a new set of experimental and bioinformatic methods in the challenging field of shotgun and SRM/MRM-based Proteomics. The requirements for a protein to be considered experimentally validated are now well-established, and the information about the human proteome is available in the neXtProt database, while targeted proteomic assays are stored in SRMAtlas. However, the study of the missing proteins continues being an outstanding issue. Areas covered: This review is focused on the implementation of proteogenomic methods designed to improve the detection and validation of the missing proteins. The evolution of the methodological strategies based on the combination of different omic technologies and the use of huge publicly available datasets is shown taking the Chromosome 16 Consortium as reference. Expert commentary: Proteogenomics and other strategies of data analysis implemented within the C-HPP initiative could be used as guidance to complete in a near future the catalog of the human proteins. Besides, in the next years, we will probably witness their use in the B/D-HPP initiative to go a step forward on the implications of the proteins in the human biology and disease.

AB  - Background: Many bioinformatics pipelines are available nowadays to analyze transcriptomics data produced by high-throughput RNA sequencing. They implement different workflows that address several analysis tasks, supported by the use of third party programs. Nevertheless, a proper workflow definition for RNA-seq data analysis is still lacking. Objective: To proper define what a comprehensive RNA-seq data analysis workflow should be. Compare all available pipelines and, if such a solution is not available, implement a new pipeline. Method: We have developed a new pipeline integrating state-of-the art programs for different parts of the RNA-seq analysis. We also have used RUbioSeq libraries to achieve a scalable solution. Results: We have defined a comprehensive RNA-seq data analysis workflow, comprising the most common needs demanded by biologists and implemented it in a new pipeline, nextpresso. We also validate it in two case studies presented here. Conclusion: Nexpresso is a new, freely available, pipeline covering the most common needs of RNA-seq data analysis. It is easy to configure, generates user friendly results and scales well for larger studies comprising a high number of samples.

AB  - RNA-based regulation has become a major research topic inmolecular biology. The analysis of epigenetic and expression data is therefore incomplete if RNA-based regulation is not taken into account. Thus, it is increasingly important but not yet standard to combine RNA-centric data and analysis tools with other types of experimental data such as RNA-seq or ChIP-seq. Here, we present the RNA workbench, a comprehensive set of analysis tools and consolidated workflows that enable the researcher to combine these two worlds. Based on the Galaxy framework the workbench guarantees simple access, easy extension, flexible adaption to personal and security needs, and sophisticated analyses that are independent of command-line knowledge. Currently, it includes more than 50 bioinformatics tools that are dedicated to different research areas of RNA biology including RNA structure analysis, RNA alignment, RNA annotation, RNA-protein interaction, ribosome profiling, RNA-seq analysis and RNA target prediction. The workbench is developed and maintained by experts in RNA bioinformatics and the Galaxy framework. Together with the growing community evolving around this workbench, we are committed to keep the workbench up-to-date for future standards and needs, providing researchers with a reliable and robust framework for RNA data analysis. Availability: The RNA workbench is available at https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench.

AB  - We present a draft genome assembly with a de novo prediction and automated functional annotation of coding genes, and a reference transcriptome of the Adzuki bean borer, Ostrinia scapulalis, based on RNA sequencing of various tissues and developmental stages. The genome assembly spans 419 Mb, has a GC content of 37.4% and includes 26,120 predicted coding genes. The reference transcriptome holds 33,080 unigenes and contains a high proportion of a set of genes conserved in eukaryotes and arthropods, used as quality assessment of the reconstructed transcripts. The new genomic and transcriptomic data presented here significantly enrich the public sequence databases for the Crambidae and Lepidoptera, and represent useful resources for future researches related to the evolution and the adaptation of phytophagous moths. The genome and transcriptome assemblies have been deposited and made accessible via a NCBI BioProject (id PRJNA390510) and the LepidoDB database ( http://bipaa.genouest.org/sp/ostrinia_scapulalis/).

AB  - Modern techniques of next-generation sequencing (NGS) allow obtaining expression profile of all genes and provide an essential basis for characterizing metabolism in the organism of interest on a broad scale. An important condition for obtaining a demonstrative physiological picture using high throughput sequencing data is the availability of the genome sequence and its sufficient annotation for the target organism. However, a list of species with properly annotated genomes is limited. Transcriptome profiling is often performed in the so-called non-model organisms, which are those with unknown or poorly assembled and/or annotated genome sequences. The transcriptomes of non-model organisms are possible to investigate using algorithms of de novo assembly of the transcripts from sequences obtained as the result of RNA sequencing. A physiological interpretation of the data is difficult in this case because of the absence of annotation of the assembled transcripts and their classification by metabolic pathway and functional category. An algorithm for transcriptome profiling in non-model organisms was developed, and a transcriptome analysis was performed for the basidiomycete Lentinus edodes. The algorithm includes open access software and custom scripts and encompasses a complete analysis pipeline from the selection of cDNA reads to the functional classification of differentially expressed genes and the visualization of the results. Based on this algorithm, a comparative transcriptome analysis of the nonpigmented mycelium and brown mycelial mat was performed in L. edodes. The comparison revealed physiological differences between the two morphogenetic stages, including an induction of cell wall biogenesis, intercellular communication, ion transport, and melanization in the brown mycelial mat.

AB  - Genetic studies have identified many risk loci for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) although causal factors in the majority of cases are still unknown. Currently, known ASD risk genes are all protein-coding genes; however, the vast majority of transcripts in humans are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) which do not encode proteins. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were shown to be highly expressed in the human brain and crucial for normal brain development. We have constructed a computational pipeline for the integration of various genomic datasets to identify lncRNAs associated with ASD. This pipeline utilizes differential gene expression patterns in affected tissues in conjunction with gene co-expression networks in tissue-matched non-affected samples. We analyzed RNA-seq data from the cortical brain tissues from ASD cases and controls to identify lncRNAs differentially expressed in ASD. We derived a gene co-expression network from an independent human brain developmental transcriptome and detected a convergence of the differentially expressed lncRNAs and known ASD risk genes into specific co-expression modules. Co-expression network analysis facilitates the discovery of associations between previously uncharacterized lncRNAs with known ASD risk genes, affected molecular pathways and at-risk developmental time points. In addition, we show that some of these lncRNAs have a high degree of overlap with major CNVs detected in ASD genetic studies. By utilizing this integrative approach comprised of differential expression analysis in affected tissues and connectivity metrics from a developmental co-expression network, we have prioritized a set of candidate ASD-associated lncRNAs. The identification of lncRNAs as novel ASD susceptibility genes could help explain the genetic pathogenesis of ASD.

AB  - A key challenge in quantitative ChIP combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the normalization of data in the presence of genome-wide changes in occupancy. Analysis-based normalization methods were developed for transcriptomic data and these are dependent on the underlying assumption that total transcription does not change between conditions. For genome-wide changes in transcription factor (TF) binding, these assumptions do not hold true. The challenges in normalization are confounded by experimental variability during sample preparation, processing and recovery. We present a novel normalization strategy utilizing an internal standard of unchanged peaks for reference. Our method can be readily applied to monitor genome-wide changes by ChIP-seq that are otherwise lost or misrepresented through analytical normalization. We compare our approach to normalization by total read depth and two alternative methods that utilize external experimental controls to study TF binding. We successfully resolve the key challenges in quantitative ChIP-seq analysis and demonstrate its application by monitoring the loss of Estrogen Receptor-alpha (ER) binding upon fulvestrant treatment, ER binding in response to estrodiol, ER mediated change in H4K12 acetylation and profiling ER binding in patient-derived xenographs. This is supported by an adaptable pipeline to normalize and quantify differential TF binding genome-wide and generate metrics for differential binding at individual sites.

AB  - Background: Insecticide resistance is a substantial problem in controlling agricultural and medical pests. Detecting target site mutations is crucial to manage insecticide resistance. Though PCR-based methods have been widely used in this field, they are time-consuming and inefficient, and typically have a high false positive rate. Acetylcholinesterases (Ace) is the neural target of the widely used organophosphate (OP) and carbamate insecticides. However, there is not any software available to detect insecticide resistance associated mutations in RNA-Seq data at present. Results: A computational pipeline ACE was developed to detect resistance mutations of ace in insect RNA-Seq data. Known ace resistance mutations were collected and used as a reference. We constructed a Web server for ACE, and the standalone software in both Linux and Windows versions is available for download. ACE was used to analyse 971 RNA-Seq data from 136 studies in 7 insect pests. The mutation frequency of each RNA-Seq dataset was calculated. The results indicated that the resistance frequency was 30%-44% in an eastern Ugandan Anopheles population, thus suggesting this resistance-conferring mutation has reached high frequency in these mosquitoes in Uganda. Analyses of RNA-Seq data from the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella indicated that the G227A mutation was positively related with resistance levels to organophosphate or carbamate insecticides. The wasp Nasonia vitripennis had a low frequency of resistant reads (<5%), but the agricultural pests Chilo suppressalis and Bemisia tabaci had a high resistance frequency. All ace reads in the 30 B. tabaci RNA-Seq data were resistant reads, suggesting that insecticide resistance has spread to very high frequency in B. tabaci. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, the ACE pipeline is the first tool to detect resistance mutations from RNA-Seq data, and it facilitates the full utilization of large-scale genetic data obtained by using next-generation sequencing.

AB  - The genetic causes of many Mendelian disorders remain undefined. Factors such as lack of large multiplex families, locus heterogeneity, and incomplete penetrance hamper these efforts for many disorders. Previous work suggests that gene-based burden testing-where the aggregate burden of rare, protein-altering variants in each gene is compared between case and control subjects-might overcome some of these limitations. The increasing availability of large-scale public sequencing databases such as Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) can enable burden testing using these databases as controls, obviating the need for additional control sequencing for each study. However, there exist various challenges with using public databases as controls, including lack of individual-level data, differences in ancestry, and differences in sequencing platforms and data processing. To illustrate the approach of using public data as controls, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 393 individuals with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), a rare disorder with significant locus heterogeneity and incomplete penetrance against control subjects from gnomAD (n = 123,136). We leveraged presumably benign synonymous variants to calibrate our approach. Through iterative analyses, we systematically addressed and overcame various sources of artifact that can arise when using public control data. In particular, we introduce an approach for highly adaptable variant quality filtering that leads to well-calibrated results. Our approach "re-discovered" genes previously implicated in IHH (FGFR1, TACR3, GNRHR). Furthermore, we identified a significant burden in TYRO3, a gene implicated in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in mice. Finally, we developed a user-friendly software package TRAPD (Test Rare vAriants with Public Data) for performing gene-based burden testing against public databases.

AB  - Genome-scale single-cell biology has recently emerged as a powerful technology with important implications for both basic and medical research. There are urgent needs for the development of computational methods or analytic pipelines to facilitate large amounts of single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis. Here, we present a detailed protocol for SINCERA (SINgle CEll RNA-Seq profiling Analysis), a generally applicable analytic pipeline for processing single-cell data from a whole organ or sorted cells. The pipeline supports the analysis for the identification of major cell types, cell type-specific gene signatures, and driving forces of given cell types. In this chapter, we provide step-by-step instructions for the functions and features of SINCERA together with application examples to provide a practical guide for the research community. SINCERA is implemented in R, licensed under the GNU General Public License v3, and freely available from CCHMC PBGE website, https://research.cchmc.org/pbge/sincera.html.

AB  - Background: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are commonly used to identify key regulatory networks that drive transcriptional programs. Although these technologies are frequently used in biological studies, NGS data analysis remains a challenging, time-consuming, and often irreproducible process. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive and flexible workflow platform that can accelerate data processing and analysis so more time can be spent on functional studies. Results: We have developed an integrative, stand-alone workflow platform, named CIPHER, for the systematic analysis of several commonly used NGS datasets including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, MNase-seq, DNase-seq, GRO-seq, and ATAC-seq data. CIPHER implements various open source software packages, in-house scripts, and Docker containers to analyze and process single-ended and pair-ended datasets. CIPHER's pipelines conduct extensive quality and contamination control checks, as well as comprehensive downstream analysis. A typical CIPHER workflow includes: (1) raw sequence evaluation, (2) read trimming and adapter removal, (3) read mapping and quality filtering, (4) visualization track generation, and (5) extensive quality control assessment. Furthermore, CIPHER conducts downstream analysis such as: narrow and broad peak calling, peak annotation, and motif identification for ChIP-seq, differential gene expression analysis for RNA-seq, nucleosome positioning for MNase-seq, DNase hypersensitive site mapping, site annotation and motif identification for DNase-seq, analysis of nascent transcription from Global-Run On (GRO-seq) data, and characterization of chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq datasets. In addition, CIPHER contains an "analysis" mode that completes complex bioinformatics tasks such as enhancer discovery and provides functions to integrate various datasets together. Conclusions: Using public and simulated data, we demonstrate that CIPHER is an efficient and comprehensive workflow platform that can analyze several NGS datasets commonly used in genome biology studies. Additionally, CIPHER's integrative "analysis" mode allows researchers to elicit important biological information from the combined dataset analysis.

AB  - This comprehensive review provides in-depth coverage of progress made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cryptorchidism, a frequent pathology first described in about 1786 by John Hunter. The first part focuses on the physiology, embryology, and histology of epididymo-testicular descent. In the last 20 years epididymo-testicular descent has become the victim of schematic drawings with an unjustified rejection of valid histological data. This part also includes discussion on the roles of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, fibroblast growth factors, Mullerian inhibiting substance, androgens, inhibin B, and insulin-like 3 in epididymo-testicular descent. The second part addresses the etiology and histology of cryptorchidism as well as the importance of mini-puberty for normal fertility development. A critical view is presented on current clinical guidelines that recommend early orchidopexy alone as the best possible treatment. Finally, by combining classical physiological information and the output of cutting-edge genomics data into a complete picture the importance of hormonal treatment in preventing cryptorchidism-induced infertility is underscored.

AB  - Purpose: Diagnostic exome sequencing (DES) is now a commonly ordered test for individuals with undiagnosed genetic disorders. In addition to providing a diagnosis for characterized diseases, exome sequencing has the capacity to uncover novel candidate genes for disease. Methods: Family-based DES included analysis of both characterized and novel genetic etiologies. To evaluate candidate genes for disease in the clinical setting, we developed a systematic, rule-based classification schema. Results: Testing identified a candidate gene among 7.7% (72/934) of patients referred for DES; 37 (4.0%) and 35 (3.7%) of the genes received evidence scores of "candidate" and "suspected candidate respectively. A total of 71 independent candidate genes were reported among the 72 patients, and 38% (27/71) were subsequently corroborated in the peer-reviewed literature. This rate of corroboration increased to 51.9% (27/52) among patients whose gene was reported at least 12 months previously. Conclusions: Herein, we provide transparent, comprehensive, and standardized scoring criteria for the clinical reporting of candidate genes. These results demonstrate that DES is an integral tool for genetic diagnosis, especially for elucidating the molecular basis for both characterized and novel candidate genetic etiologies. Gene discoveries also advance the understanding of normal human biology and more common diseases.

AB  - In metabolic diagnostics, there is an emerging need for a comprehensive test to acquire a complete view of metabolite status. Here, we describe a non-quantitative direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry (DI-HRMS) based metabolomics method and evaluate the method for both dried blood spots (DBS) and plasma. 110 DBS of 42 patients harboring 23 different inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and 86 plasma samples of 38 patients harboring 21 different IEM were analyzed using DI-HRMS. A peak calling pipeline developed in R programming language provided Z-scores for similar to 1875 mass peaks corresponding to similar to 3835 metabolite annotations (including isomers) per sample. Based on metabolite Z-scores, patients were assigned a 'most probable diagnosis' by an investigator blinded for the known diagnoses of the patients. Based on DBS sample analysis, 37/42 of the patients, corresponding to 22/23 IEM, could be correctly assigned a 'most probable diagnosis'. Plasma sample analysis, resulted in a correct 'most probable diagnosis' in 32/38 of the patients, corresponding to 19/21 IEM. The added clinical value of the method was illustrated by a case wherein DI-HRMS metabolomics aided interpretation of a variant of unknown significance (VUS) identified by whole-exome sequencing. In summary, non-quantitative DI-HRMS metabolomics in DBS and plasma is a very consistent, high-throughput and nonselective method for investigating the metabolome in genetic disease.

AB  - Background: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) is now commonly used to reveal quantitative spatiotemporal snapshots of the transcriptome, the structures of transcripts (splice variants and fusions) and landscapes of expressed mutations. However, standard approaches for library construction typically require relatively high amounts of input RNA, are labor intensive, and are time consuming. Methods: Here, we report the outcome of a systematic effort to optimize and streamline steps in strand-specific RNA-seq library construction. Results: This work has resulted in the identification of an optimized messenger RNA isolation protocol, a potent reverse transcriptase for cDNA synthesis, and an efficient chemistry and a simplified formulation of library construction reagents. We also present an optimization of bead-based purification and size selection designed to maximize the recovery of cDNA fragments. Conclusions: These developments have allowed us to assemble a rapid high throughput pipeline that produces high quality data from amounts of total RNA as low as 25 ng. While the focus of this study is on RNA-seq sample preparation, some of these developments are also relevant to other next-generation sequencing library types.

AB  - Recently, chimeric transcripts have been found to be associated with the pathogenesis and poor prognosis of malignant tumors. Through our preliminary experiment, a novel chimeric transcript called chimeric transcript RRM2-c2orf48 was detected in C666-1, a classical cell line of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Therefore, the objective of this study was to demonstrate the existence and expression of novel chimeric transcript RRM2-c2orf48 and to explore the main functions and mechanisms of RRM2-c2orf48 in NPC. In this study, the expression of RRM2-c2orf48 was evaluated in NPC cells and specimens. Effects of RRM2-c2orf48 on migration and invasive capacities were detected in vivo and vitro. Moreover, ways in which RRM2-c2orf48 increases the invasive capacities of NPC were explored. As a result, the presence of novel chimeric transcript RRM2-c2orf48 was confirmed in C666-1 by RT-PCR and sequencing, and it was a read-through between RRM2 and c2orf48 through the transcription of interchromosome. Higher expressions of novel RRM2-c2orf48 were detected in NPC cell lines and NPC tissue specimens relative to the controls and its expression was be statistically relevant to TNM staging. High level of RRM2-c2orf48 could increase the migration and invasive capacities of NPC cells, potentially as a result of NPC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition. RRM2-c2orf48 could also enhance resistance of chemotherapy. In vivo, RRM2-c2orf48 could enhance lung and lymph node metastasis in nude mice. These results demonstrate that high levels of RRM2-c2orf48 expression may be a useful predictor of NPC patients of metastatic potency, presenting potential implications for NPC diagnosis and therapy.

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies are poised to reshape the current cell-type classification system. However, a transcriptome-based single-cell atlas has not been achieved for complex mammalian systems. Here, we developed Microwell-seq, a high-throughput and low-cost scRNA-seq platform using simple, inexpensive devices. Using Microwell-seq, we analyzed more than 400,000 single cells covering all of the major mouse organs and constructed a basic scheme for a mouse cell atlas (MCA). We reveal a single-cell hierarchy for many tissues that have not been well characterized previously. We built a web-based "single-cell MCA analysis" pipeline that accurately defines cell types based on single-cell digital expression. Our study demonstrates the wide applicability of the Microwell-seq technology and MCA resource.

AB  - The dorsal horn of the spinal cord is critical to processing distinct modalities of noxious and innocuous sensation, but little is known of the neuronal subtypes involved, hampering efforts to deduce principles governing somatic sensation. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to classify sensory neurons in the mouse dorsal horn. We identified 15 inhibitory and 15 excitatory molecular subtypes of neurons, equaling the complexity in cerebral cortex. Validating our classification scheme in vivo and matching cell types to anatomy of the dorsal horn by spatial transcriptomics reveals laminar enrichment for each of the cell types. Neuron types, when combined, define a multilayered organization with like neurons layered together. Employing our scheme, we find that heat and cold stimuli activate discrete sets of both excitatory and inhibitory neuron types. This work provides a systematic and comprehensive molecular classification of spinal cord sensory neurons, enabling functional interrogation of sensory processing.

AB  - Background: The technological advances of RNA-seq and de novo transcriptome assembly have enabled genome annotation and transcriptome profiling in highly heterozygous species such as grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). This work is an attempt to utilize a de novo-assembled transcriptome of the V. vinifera cultivar 'Riesling' to improve annotation of the grapevine reference genome sequence. Results: Here we show that the transcriptome assembly of a single V. vinifera cultivar is insufficient for a complete genome annotation of the grapevine reference genome constructed from V. vinifera PN40024. Further, we provide evidence that the gene models we identified cannot be completely anchored to the previously published V. vinifera PN40024 gene models. In addition to these findings, we present a computational pipeline for the de novo identification of lncRNAs. Our results demonstrate that, in grapevine, lncRNAs are significantly different from protein coding transcripts in such metrics as length, GC-content, minimum free energy, and length-corrected minimum free energy. Conclusions: In grapevine, high-level heterozygosity necessitates that transcriptome characterization be based on cultivar-specific reference genome sequences. Our results strengthen the hypothesis that lncRNAs have thermodynamically different properties than protein-coding RNAs. The analyses of both coding and noncoding RNAs will be instrumental in uncovering inter-cultivar variation in wild and cultivated grapevine species.

AB  - A Summary: Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data requires the processing of large datasets by chaining various tools with complex input and output formats. In order to automate data analysis, we propose to standardize NGS tasks into modular workflows. This simplifies reliable handling and processing of NGS data, and corresponding solutions become substantially more reproducible and easier to maintain. Here, we present a documented, linux-based, toolbox of 42 processing modules that are combined to construct workflows facilitating a variety of tasks such as DNAseq and RNAseq analysis. We also describe important technical extensions. The high throughput executor (HTE) helps to increase the reliability and to reduce manual interventions when processing complex datasets. We also provide a dedicated binary manager that assists users in obtaining the modules' executables and keeping them up to date. As basis for this actively developed toolbox we use the workflow management software KNIME.

AB  - Sequencing of transcribed RNA molecules (RNA-Seq) has been used wildly for studying cell transcriptomes in bulk or at the single-cell level (Wang et al., Nat Rev Genet, 10:57-63, 2009; Ozsolak and Milos, Nat Rev Genet, 12:87-98, 2011; Sandberg, Nat Methods, 11:22-24, 2014) and is becoming the de facto technology for investigating gene expression level changes in various biological conditions, on the time course, and under drug treatments. Furthermore, RNA-Seq data helped identify fusion genes that are related to certain cancers (Maher et al., Nature, 458:97-101, 2009). Differential gene expression before and after drug treatments provides insights to mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics of the drugs, and safety concerns (Dixit et al., Genomics, 107:178-188, 2016). Because each RNA-Seq run generates tens to hundreds of millions of short reads with size ranging from 50 to 200 bp, a tool that deciphers these short reads to an integrated and digestible analysis report is in high demand. QuickRNASeq (Zhao et al., BMC Genomics, 17:39-53, 2016) is an application for large-scale RNA-Seq data analysis and real-time interactive visualization of complex data sets. This application automates the use of several of the best open-source tools to efficiently generate user friendly, easy to share, and ready to publish report. Figures in this protocol illustrate some of the interactive plots produced by QuickRNASeq. The visualization features of the application have been further improved since its first publication in early 2016. The original QuickRNASeq publication (Zhao et al., BMC Genomics, 17:39-53, 2016) provided details of background, software selection, and implementation. Here, we outline the steps required to implement QuickRNASeq in user's own environment, as well as demonstrate some basic yet powerful utilities of the advanced interactive visualization modules in the report.

AB  - Loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta is widely distributed in the oceans of tropical and subtropical latitude. This turtle is an endangered species due to anthropic and natural factors that have decreased their population levels. In this study, RNA sequencing and de-novo assembly of genes expressed in blood were performed. The raw FASTQ files have been deposited on NCBI's SRA database with accession number SRX2629512. A total of 5.4 Gb raw sequence data were obtained, corresponding to 48,257,019 raw reads. Trinity pipeline was used to perform a de-novo assembly, we were able to identify 64,930 transcripts for female loggerhead turtle transcriptome with an N50 of 1131 bp. The obtained transcriptome data will be useful for further studies of the physiology, biochemistry and evolution in this species.

AB  - Single-cell RNA-seq's (scRNA-seq) unprecedented cellular resolution at a genome-wide scale enables us to address questions about cellular heterogeneity that are inaccessible using methods that average over bulk tissue extracts. However, scRNA-seq data sets also present additional challenges such as high transcript dropout rates, stochastic transcription events, and complex population substructures. Here, we present a single-cell RNA-seq analysis and klustering evaluation (SAKE), a robust method for scRNA-seq analysis that provides quantitative statistical metrics at each step of the analysis pipeline. Comparing SAKE to multiple single-cell analysis methods shows that most methods perform similarly across a wide range of cellular contexts, with SAKE outperforming these methods in the case of large complex populations. We next applied the SAKE algorithms to identify drug-resistant cellular populations as human melanoma cells respond to targeted BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). Single-cell RNA-seq data from both the Fluidigm C1 and 10x Genomics platforms were analyzed with SAKE to dissect this problem at multiple scales. Data from both platforms indicate that BRAF inhibitor-resistant cells can emerge from rare populations already present before drug application, with SAKE identifying both novel and known markers of resistance. These experimentally validated markers of BRAFi resistance share overlap with previous analyses in different melanoma cell lines, demonstrating the generality of these findings and highlighting the utility of single-cell analysis to elucidate mechanisms of BRAFi resistance.

AB  - Motivation: Many repetitive DNA elements are transcribed at appreciable expression levels. Mapping the corresponding RNA sequencing reads back to a reference genome is notoriously difficult and error-prone task, however. This is in particular true if chemical modifications introduce systematic mismatches, while at the same time the genomic loci are only approximately identical, as in the case of tRNAs. Results: We therefore developed a dedicated mapping strategy to handle RNA-seq reads that map to tRNAs relying on a modified target genome in which known tRNA loci are masked and instead intronless tRNA precursor sequences are appended as artificial 'chromosomes'. In a first pass, reads that overlap the boundaries of mature tRNAs are extracted. In the second pass, the remaining reads are mapped to a tRNA-masked target that is augmented by representative mature tRNA sequences. Using both simulated and real life data we show that our best-practice workflow removes most of the mapping artefacts introduced by simpler mapping schemes and makes it possible to reliably identify many of chemical tRNA modifications in generic small RNA-seq data. Using simulated data the FDR is only 2%. We find compelling evidence for tissue specific differences of tRNA modification patterns.

AB  - Calotropis gigantea produces specialized secondary metabolites known as cardenolides, which have anticancer and antimalarial properties. Although transcriptomic studies have been conducted in other cardenolide-producing species, no nuclear genome assembly for an Asterid cardenolide-producing species has been reported to date. A high-quality de novo assembly was generated for C. gigantea, representing 157,284,427 bp with an N50 scaffold size of 805,959 bp, for which quality assessments indicated a near complete representation of the genic space. Transcriptome data in the form of RNA-sequencing libraries from a developmental tissue series was generated to aid the annotation and construction of a gene expression atlas. Using an ab initio and evidence-driven gene annotation pipeline, 18,197 high-confidence genes were annotated. Homologous and syntenic relationships between C. gigantea and other species within the Apocynaceae family confirmed previously identified evolutionary relationships, and suggest the emergence or loss of the specialized cardenolide metabolites after the divergence of the Apocynaceae subfamilies. The C. gigantea genome assembly, annotation, and RNA-sequencing data provide a novel resource to study the cardenolide biosynthesis pathway, especially for understanding the evolutionary origin of cardenolides and the engineering of cardenolide production in heterologous organisms for existing and novel pharmaceutical applications.

AB  - Extensive use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for pathogen profiling has the potential to transform our understanding of how genomic plasticity contributes to phenotypic versatility. However, the storage of large amounts of NGS data and visualization tools need to evolve to offer the scientific community fast and convenient access to these data. We introduce BACTOME as a database system that links aligned DNA- and RNA-sequencing reads of clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates with clinically relevant pathogen phenotypes. The database allows data extraction for any single isolate, gene or phenotype as well as data filtering and phenotypic grouping for specific research questions. With the integration of statistical tools we illustrate the usefulness of a relational database structure for the identification of phenotype-genotype correlations as an essential part of the discovery pipeline in genomic research. Furthermore, the database provides a compilation of DNA sequences and gene expression values of a plethora of clinical isolates to give a consensus DNA sequence and consensus gene expression signature. Deviations from the consensus thereby describe the genomic landscape and the transcriptional plasticity of the species P. aeruginosa. The database is available at https://bactome.helmholtz-hzi.de.

International support for mass drug administration, bed nets, and other preventive measures has resulted in huge public health gains, while support for translational research is leading to the development of some new neglected disease drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines. However, funding for basic science research has not kept up, such that we are missing opportunities to create a more innovative pipeline of control tools for parasitic and related diseases. There is an urgent need to expand basic science approaches for neglected diseases, especially in the areas of systems biology and immunology; ecology, evolution, and mathematical biology; functional and comparative OMICs; gene editing; expanded use of model organisms; and a new single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing approach. The world's poor deserve access to innovation for neglected diseases. It should be considered a fundamental human right.

AB  - Cell-based assays are an attractive option to measure gene expression response to exposure, but the cost of whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing has been a barrier to the use of gene expression profiling for in vitro toxicity screening. In addition, standard RNA sequencing adds variability due to variable transcript length and amplification. Targeted probe-sequencing technologies such as TempO-Seq, with transcriptomic representation that can vary from hundreds of genes to the entire transcriptome, may reduce some components of variation. Analyses of high-throughput toxicogenomics data require renewed attention to read-calling algorithms and simplified dose-response modeling for datasets with relatively few samples. Using data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes treated with chemicals at varying concentrations, we describe here and make available a pipeline for handling expression data generated by TempO-Seq to align reads, clean and normalize raw count data, identify differentially expressed genes, and calculate transcriptomic concentration-response points of departure. The methods are extensible to other forms of concentration-response gene-expression data, and we discuss the utility of the methods for assessing variation in susceptibility and the diseased cellular state.

AB  - Context: Self-limited delayed puberty (DP) is often associated with a delay in physical maturation, but although highly heritable the causal genetic factors remain elusive. Genome-wide association studies of the timing of puberty have identified multiple loci for age at menarche in females and voice break in males, particularly in pathways controlling energy balance. Objective/Main Outcome Measures: We sought to assess the contribution of rare variants in such genes to the phenotype of familial DP. Design/Patients: We performed whole-exome sequencing in 67 pedigrees (125 individuals with DP and 35 unaffected controls) from our unique cohort of familial self-limited DP. Using a whole-exome sequencing filtering pipeline one candidate gene [fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO)] was identified. In silico, in vitro, and mouse model studies were performed to investigate the pathogenicity of FTO variants and timing of puberty in FTO+/- mice. Results: We identified potentially pathogenic, rare variants in genes in linkage disequilibrium with genome-wide association studies of age at menarche loci in 283 genes. Of these, five genes were implicated in the control of body mass. After filtering for segregation with trait, one candidate, FTO, was retained. Two FTO variants, found in 14 affected individuals from three families, were also associated with leanness in these patients with DP. One variant (p. Leu44Val) demonstrated altered demethylation activity of the mutant protein in vitro. Fto(+/-) mice displayed a significantly delayed timing of pubertal onset (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Mutations in genes implicated in body mass and timing of puberty in the general population may contribute to the pathogenesis of self-limited DP.

AB  - Electroacupuncture (EA) can relieve various pains. However, its mechanism in terms of the transcriptome is still not well-known. To explore the full profile of EA-induced molecular modification in the central nerve system, three twins of goats were selected for a match-paired experiment: EA stimulation (60 Hz, 30 min) and none-EA (control). Goats in the EA group showed an increased (p < 0.05) nociceptive threshold compared with the control goats. Experimental goats were sacrificed at 4 h of the experiment, and the periaqueductal grays were harvested for RNA sequencing. As a result, 2651 differentially expressed genes (1803 up-regulated and 848 down-regulated genes) were found and enriched in 30 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and 149 gene ontology terms. EA-regulated five neuropeptide genes (proenkephalin, proopiomelanocortin, preprodynorphin, diazepam-binding inhibitor and proprotein convertase 1 inhibitor) were validated with quantitative PCR. Furthermore, up-regulated glutamate receptors, glutamate transporters, -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, GABA transporters, synaptotagmins or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) genes might contribute to EA-induced analgesia through regulating the glutamatergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, MAPKs, ribosome or ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Our findings reveal a full profile of molecular modification in response to EA and provide a solid experimental framework for exploring the mechanisms underlying EA-induced analgesia.

AB  - Background: Honeybee development consists of four stages: embryo, larva, pupa and adult. Embryogenesis, a key process of cell division and differentiation, takes 3 days in honeybees. However, the embryonic transcriptome and the dynamic regulation of embryonic transcription are still largely uncharacterized in honeybees, especially in the Asian honeybee (Apis cerana). Here, we employed high-quality RNA-seq to explore the transcriptome of Asian honeybee embryos at three ages, approximately 24, 48 and 72 h (referred to as Day1, Day2 and Day3, respectively). Results: Nine embryo samples, three from each age, were collected for RNA-seq. According to the staging scheme of honeybee embryos and the morphological features we observed, our Day1, Day2 and Day3 embryos likely corresponded to the late stage four, stage eight and stage ten development stages, respectively. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis showed that same-age samples were grouped together, and the Day2 samples had a closer relationship with the Day3 samples than the Day1 samples. Finally, a total of 18,284 genes harboring 55,646 transcripts were detected in the A. cerana embryos, of which 44.5% consisted of the core transcriptome shared by all three ages of embryos. A total of 4088 upregulated and 3046 downregulated genes were identified among the three embryo ages, of which 2010, 3177 and 1528 genes were upregulated and 2088, 2294 and 303 genes were downregulated from Day1 to Day2, from Day1 to Day3 and from Day2 to Day3, respectively. The downregulated genes were mostly involved in cellular, biosynthetic and metabolic processes, gene expression and protein localization, and macromolecule modification; the upregulated genes mainly participated in cell development and differentiation, tissue, organ and system development, and morphogenesis. Interestingly, several biological processes related to the response to and detection of light stimuli were enriched in the first-day A. cerana embryogenesis but not in the Apis mellifera embryogenesis, which was valuable for further investigations. Conclusions: Our transcriptomic data substantially expand the number of known transcribed elements in the A. cerana genome and provide a high-quality view of the transcriptome dynamics of A. cerana embryonic development.

AB  - Sequencing technologies have made considerable advancements. From the Sanger sequencing method to the next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods, and from the NGS methods to the third-generation sequencing methods, we can see the development thread of the sequencing technology. Currently, NGS is the main contender in the sequencing market. NGS technologies provide an opportunity to research the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in detail. The NGS platforms have their own special characteristics, but share some main ideas. DNA sequencing via NGS is fundamental for RNA sequencing and miRNA sequencing. MiRNA sequencing has special characteristics. The pipeline of miRNA sequencing by NGS is explained in detail from the wet experiment to the dry experiment.

AB  - BackgroundBeing critically important to the ecosystem, the stability of coral reefs is directly related to the marine and surrounding terrestrial environments. However, coral reefs are now undergoing massive and accelerating devastation due to bleaching. The fact that the breakdown of symbiosis between coral and the dinoflagellate, zooxanthellae, has been well elucidated as the main cause of bleaching, implying the establishment of symbiosis with zooxanthellae plays a crucial role in maintaining coral survival. However, the relevant molecular and cellular mechanisms have not been well studied yet. In this study, based on the deep RNA-sequencing data derived from Mohamed, A. R. et al., an integrated transcriptome analysis was performed to deeply investigate global transcriptome changes of the coral Acropora digitifera in response to infection by dinoflagellate of the genus Symbiodinium.ResultsThe results revealed that compared to RefTranscriptome_v1.0 (A. digitifera transcriptome assembly v1.0), numerous novel transcripts and isoforms were identified, the Symbiodinium-infected coral larvae at 4h generated the highest proportion of specific isoforms. Alternative splicing analysis showed that intron retention predominated in all alternative transcripts among six statuses. Additionally, 8117 lncRNAs were predicted via a stringent stepwise filtering pipeline. A complex lncRNAs-mRNAs network including 815 lncRNAs and 6395 mRNAs were established, in which 21 lncRNAs were differentially expressed at 4h post infection. Functional clustering analysis for those differentially lncRNAs-coexpressed mRNAs demonstrated that several biological processes and pathways related to protein kinase activity, metabolic pathways, mitochondrion, ribosome, etc. were enriched.ConclusionsOur study not only refined A. digitifera transcriptome via identification of novel transcripts and isoforms, but also predicted a high-confidence dataset of lncRNAs. Functional study based on the construction of lncRNAs-mRNAs co-expression network has disclosed a complex lncRNA-mediated regulation in response to Symbiodinium infection exhibited in A. digitifera. Once validated, these lncRNAs could be good potential targets for treatment and prevention of bleaching in coral.

AB  - Juvenile onset open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) affects patients before 40 years of age, causing high intraocular pressure and severe optic nerve damage. To expand the mutation spectrum of the causative genes in JOAG, with a view to identify novel disease-causing mutations, we investigated MYOC, OPTN, NTF4, WDR36 and CYP1B1 in a cohort of 67 unrelated Chinese JOAG patients. Whole exome sequencing was used to identify possible pathogenic mutations, which were further excluded in normal controls. After sequencing and the use of a database pipeline, as well as predictive assessment filtering, we identified a total of six mutations in three genes, MYOC, OPTN and CYP1B1. Among them, 2 heterozygous mutations in MYOC (c. 1109C > T, p. (P370L); c. 1150G > C, p. (D384H)), 2 heterozygous mutations in OPTN (c. 985A > G, p.(R329G); c. 1481T > G, p. (L494W)) and 2 homozygous mutations in CYP1B1 (c. 1412T > G, p.(I471S); c. 1169G > A, p.(R390H)) were identified as potentially causative mutations. No mutation was detected in NTF4 or WDR36. Our results enrich the mutation spectra and frequencies of MYOC, OPTN and CYP1B1 in JOAG among the Chinese population. Further studies are needed to address the pathogenicity of each of the mutations detected in this study.

AB  - Background: Anti-microbial peptides (AMPs), naturally encoded by genes and generally containing 12-100 amino acids, are crucial components of the innate immune system and can protect the host from various pathogenic bacteria and viruses. In recent years, the widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in the rapid growth of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms that often induce critical infection and pathogenesis. Recently, the advent of high-throughput technologies has led molecular biology into a data surge in both the amount and scope of data. For instance, next-generation sequencing technology has been applied to generate large-scale sequencing reads from foods, water, soil, air, and specimens to identify microbiota and their functions based on metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, respectively. In addition, oolong tea is partially fermented and is the most widely produced tea in Taiwan. Many studies have shown the benefits of oolong tea in inhibiting obesity, reducing dental plaque deposition, antagonizing allergic immune responses, and alleviating the effects of aging. However, the microbes and their functions present in oolong tea remain unknown. Results: To understand the relationship between Taiwanese oolong teas and bacterial communities, we designed a novel bioinformatics scheme to identify AMPs and their functional types based on metagenomics and metatranscriptomic analysis of high-throughput transcriptome data. Four types of oolong teas (Dayuling tea, Alishan tea, Jinxuan tea, and Oriental Beauty tea) were subjected to 16S ribosomal DNA and total RNA extraction and sequencing. Metagenomics analysis results revealed that Oriental Beauty tea exhibited greater bacterial diversity than other teas. The most common bacterial families across all tea types were Bacteroidaceae (21.7%), Veillonellaceae (22%), and Fusobacteriaceae (12.3%). Metatranscriptomics analysis results revealed that the dominant bacteria species across all tea types were Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Chryseobacterium sp. StRB126, which were subjected to further functional analysis. A total of 8194 (6.5%), 26,220 (6.1%), 5703 (5.8%), and 106,183 (7.8%) reads could be mapped to AMPs. Conclusion: We found that the distribution of anti-gram-positive and anti-gram-negative AMPs is highly correlated with the distribution of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in Taiwanese oolong tea samples.

AB  - Objective: This paper describes the Precision Medicine Knowledge Base (PMKB; https://pmkb.weill.cornell.edu), an interactive online application for collaborative editing, maintenance, and sharing of structured clinical-grade cancer mutation interpretations. Materials and Methods: PMKB was built using the Ruby on Rails Web application framework. Leveraging existing standards such as the Human Genome Variation Society variant description format, we implemented a data model that links variants to tumor-specific and tissue-specific interpretations. Key features of PMKB include support for all major variant types, standardized authentication, distinct user roles including high-level approvers, and detailed activity history. A REpresentational State Transfer (REST) application-programming interface (API) was implemented to query the PMKB programmatically. Results: At the time of writing, PMKB contains 457 variant descriptions with 281 clinical-grade interpretations. The EGFR, BRAF, KRAS, and KIT genes are associated with the largest numbers of interpretable variants. PMKB's interpretations have been used in over 1500 AmpliSeq tests and 750 whole-exome sequencing tests. The interpretations are accessed either directly via the Web interface or programmatically via the existing API. Discussion: An accurate and up-to-date knowledge base of genomic alterations of clinical significance is critical to the success of precision medicine programs. The open-access, programmatically accessible PMKB represents an important attempt at creating such a resource in the field of oncology. Conclusion: The PMKB was designed to help collect and maintain clinical-grade mutation interpretations and facilitate reporting for clinical cancer genomic testing. The PMKB was also designed to enable the creation of clinical cancer genomics automated reporting pipelines via an API.

AB  - Single cell sequencing (SCS) can be harnessed to acquire the genomes, transcriptomes and epigenomes from individual cells. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology is the driving force for single cell sequencing. scRNA-seq requires a lengthy pipeline comprising of single cell sorting, RNA extraction, reverse transcription, amplification, library construction, sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis. Computational algorithms are essential to fulfill many tasks of interest using scRNA-seq data. scRNA-seq has already enabled researchers to revisit long-standing questions in cancer biology, including cancer metastasis, heterogeneity and evolution. Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) are not only an important mechanism for cancer metastasis, but also provide a possibility to diagnose and monitor cancer in a convenient way independent of surgical resection of the cancer.

AB  - Background: The three prime untranslated region (3 '-UTR) is known to play a pivotal role in modulating gene expression by determining the fate of mRNA. Many crucial developmental events, such as mammalian spermatogenesis, tissue patterning, sex determination and neurogenesis, rely heavily on post-transcriptional regulation by the 3 '-UTR. However, 3 '-UTR biology seems to be a relatively untapped field, with only limited tools and 3 '-UTR resources available. To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of the 3 '-UTR on gene expression, firstly the 3 '-UTR sequences must be identified. Current 3 '-UTR mining tools, such as GETUTR, 3USS and UTRscan, all depend on a well-annotated reference genome or curated 3 '-UTR sequences, which hinders their application on a myriad of non-model organisms where the genomes are not available. To address these issues, the establishment of an NGS-based, automated pipeline is urgently needed for genome-wide 3 '-UTR prediction in the absence of reference genomes. Results: Here, we propose ExUTR, a novel NGS-based pipeline to predict and retrieve 3 '-UTR sequences from RNA-Seq experiments, particularly designed for non-model species lacking well-annotated genomes. This pipeline integrates cutting-edge bioinformatics tools, databases (Uniprot and UTRdb) and novel in-house Perl scripts, implementing a fully automated workflow. By taking transcriptome assemblies as inputs, this pipeline identifies 3 '-UTR signals based primarily on the intrinsic features of transcripts, and outputs predicted 3 '-UTR candidates together with associated annotations. In addition, ExUTR only requires minimal computational resources, which facilitates its implementation on a standard desktop computer with reasonable runtime, making it affordable to use for most laboratories. We also demonstrate the functionality and extensibility of this pipeline using publically available RNA-Seq data from both model and non-model species, and further validate the accuracy of predicted 3 '-UTR using both well-characterized 3 ' UTR resources and 3P-Seq data. Conclusions: ExUTR is a practical and powerful workflow that enables rapid genome-wide 3 '-UTR discovery from NGS data. The candidates predicted through this pipeline will further advance the study of miRNA target prediction, cis elements in 3 '-UTR and the evolution and biology of 3 '-UTRs. Being independent of a well-annotated reference genome will dramatically expand its application to much broader research area, encompassing all species for which RNA-Seq is available.

AB  - Background: Reliable exon recognition is key to the splicing of pre-mRNAs into mature mRNAs. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein whose nuclear loss and cytoplasmic aggregation are a hallmark pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). TDP-43 depletion causes the aberrant inclusion of cryptic exons into a range of transcripts, but their extent, relevance to disease pathogenesis and whether they are caused by other RNA-binding proteins implicated in ALS/FTD are unknown. Methods: We developed an analysis pipeline to discover and quantify cryptic exon inclusion and applied it to publicly available human and murine RNA-sequencing data. Results: We detected widespread cryptic splicing in TDP-43 depletion datasets but almost none in another ALS/FTD-linked protein FUS. Sequence motif and iCLIP analysis of cryptic exons demonstrated that they are bound by TDP-43. Unlike the cryptic exons seen in hnRNP C depletion, those repressed by TDP-43 cannot be linked to transposable elements. Cryptic exons are poorly conserved and inclusion overwhelmingly leads to non-sensemediated decay of the host transcript, with reduced transcript levels observed in differential expression analysis. RNA-protein interaction data on 73 different RNA-binding proteins showed that, in addition to TDP-43, 7 specifically bind TDP-43 linked cryptic exons. This suggests that TDP-43 competes with other splicing factors for binding to cryptic exons and can repress cryptic exon inclusion. Conclusions: Our quantitative analysis pipeline confirms the presence of cryptic exons during the depletion of TDP-43 but not FUS providing new insight into to RNA-processing dysfunction as a cause or consequence in ALS/FTD.

AB  - Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most prevalent post-transcriptional modification of RNA molecules. Researchers have attempted to find reliable RNA editing using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. However, most of these attempts suffered from a high rate of false positives, and they did not consider the clinical relevance of the identified RNA editing, for example, in disease progression. We devised an effective RNA-editing discovery pipeline called CREDO, which includes novel statistical filtering modules based on integration of DNA- and RNA-seq data from matched tumor-normal tissues. CREDO was compared with three other RNA-editing discovery pipelines and found to give significantly fewer false positives. Application of CREDO to breast cancer data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project discovered highly confident RNA editing with clinical relevance to cancer progression in terms of patient survival. RNA-editing detection using DNA- and RNA-seq data from matched tumor-normal tissues should be more routinely performed as multiple omics data are becoming commonly available from each patient sample. We believe CREDO is an effective and reliable tool for this problem.

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has significantly deepened our insights into complex tissues, with the latest techniques capable of processing tens of thousands of cells simultaneously. Analyzing increasing numbers of cells, however, generates extremely large data sets, extending processing time and challenging computing resources. Current scRNA-seq analysis tools are not designed to interrogate large data sets and often lack sensitivity to identify marker genes. With bigSCale, we provide a scalable analytical framework to analyze millions of cells, which addresses the challenges associated with large data sets. To handle the noise and sparsity of scRNA-seq data, bigSCale uses large sample sizes to estimate an accurate numerical model of noise. The framework further includes modules for differential expression analysis, cell clustering, and marker identification. A directed convolution strategy allows processing of extremely large data sets, while preserving transcript information from individual cells. We evaluated the performance of bigSCale using both a biological model of aberrant gene expression in patient-derived neuronal progenitor cells and simulated data sets, which underlines the speed and accuracy in differential expression analysis. To test its applicability for large data sets, we applied bigSCale to assess 1.3 million cells from the mouse developing forebrain. Its directed down-sampling strategy accumulates information from single cells into index cell transcriptomes, thereby defining cellular clusters with improved resolution. Accordingly, index cell clusters identified rare populations, such as reelin (Reln)-positive Cajal-Retzius neurons, for which we report previously unrecognized heterogeneity associated with distinct differentiation stages, spatial organization, and cellular function. Together, bigSCale presents a solution to address future challenges of large single-cell data sets.

AB  - Plant transcription factors have potential to behave as hubs in gene regulatory networks through altering the expression of many downstream genes, and identification of such hub transcription factors strongly enhances our understating of biological processes. Transcriptome analysis has become a staple of gene expression analyses. In addition to current advances in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, various methods for mRNA library construction and downstream data analyses have been enthusiastically developed. Here, we describe Breath Adapter Directional sequencing (BrAD-seq), a simple strand-specific mRNA library preparation for the Illumina platform, allowing easy scaling of transcriptome experiments with low reagent and labor costs. This protocol includes our recent modifications and the detailed practical procedure for BrAD-seq. Because extracting biological meanings from large-scale transcriptome data presents a significant challenge, we also describe a new analytical method that goes beyond differential expression. Differential regulatory analysis (DRA) is based on a gene co-expression network to address which regulatory factor or factors have the ability to predict the abundance of differentially expressed genes between two groups or conditions. This protocol provides a ready-to-use informatics pipeline from raw sequence data to DRA for plant transcriptome datasets.

AB  - Interrogation of tissue informs on patient management through delivery of a diagnosis together with associated clinically relevant data. The diagnostic pathologist will usually evaluate the morphological appearances of a tissue sample and, occasionally, the pattern of expression of a limited number of biomarkers. Recent developments in sequencing technology mean that DNA and RNA from tissue samples can now be interrogated in great detail. These new technologies, collectively known as next-generation sequencing (NGS), generate huge amounts of data which can be used to support patient management. In order to maximize the utility of tissue interrogation, the molecular data need to be interpreted and integrated with the morphological data. However, in order to interpret the molecular data, the pathologist must understand the utility and the limitations of NGS data. In this review, the principles behind NGS technologies are described. In addition, the caveats in the interpretation of the data are discussed, and a scheme is presented to "classify" the types of data which are generated. Finally, a glossary of new terminology is included to help pathologists become familiar with the lexicon of NGS-derived molecular data. (c) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Background: The role of alkaloids isolated from Rhazya stricta Decne (Apocynaceae family) (RS) in targeting genes involved in cancer and metastasis remains to be elucidated. Objective: Identify and characterize new compounds from RS, which inhibit gene(s) involved in the survival, invasion, self-renewal, and metastatic processes of cancer cells. Methods: Bioinformatics study was performed using HISAT2, stringtie, and ballgown pipeline to understand expressional differences between a normal epithelial cell line-MCF10A and MCF7. NMR and ATR-FTIR were performed to elucidate the structure of rhazyaminine (R.A), isolated from R stricta. Cell viability assay was performed using 0, 25, and 50 mu g/mL of total extract of R stricta (TERS) and R. A, respectively, for 0, 24, and 48 hours, followed by scratch assay. In addition, total RNA was isolated for RNA-seq analysis of MCF7 cell line treated with R. A followed by qRT-PCR analysis of Bcl-2 gene. Results: Deptor, which is upregulated in MCF7 compared with MCF10A as found in our bioinformatics study was downregulated by R. A. Furthermore, R. A effectively reduced cell viability to around 50% (P <.05) and restricted cell migration in scratch assay. Thirteen genes, related to metastasis and cancer stem cells, were downregulated by R. A according to RNA-seq analysis. Additionally, qRT-PCR validated the downregulation of Bcl-2 gene in R. A-treated cells by less than 0.5 folds (P <.05). Conclusion: R. A successfully downregulated key genes involved in apoptosis, cell survival, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer stem cell proliferation, and Wnt signal transduction pathway making it an excellent "lead candidate" molecule for in vivo proof-of-concept studies.

AB  - Phylogenomics is extremely powerful but introduces new challenges as no agreement exists on 'standards' for data selection, curation and tree inference. We use jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomata) as a model to address these issues. Despite considerable efforts in resolving their evolutionary history and macroevolution, few studies have included a full phylogenetic diversity of gnathostomes, and some relationships remain controversial. We tested a new bioinformatic pipeline to assemble large and accurate phylogenomic datasets from RNA sequencing and found this phylotranscriptomic approach to be successful and highly cost- effective. Increased sequencing effort up to about 10 Gbp allows more genes to be recovered, but shallower sequencing (1.5 Gbp) is sufficient to obtain thousands of full-length orthologous transcripts. We reconstruct a robust and strongly supported timetree of jawed vertebrates using 7,189 nuclear genes from 100 taxa, including 23 new transcriptomes from previously unsampled key species. Gene jackknifing of genomic data corroborates the robustness of our tree and allows calculating genome-wide divergence times by overcoming gene sampling bias. Mitochondrial genomes prove insufficient to resolve the deepest relationships because of limited signal and among-lineage rate heterogeneity. Our analyses emphasize the importance of large, curated, nuclear datasets to increase the accuracy of phylogenomics and provide a reference framework for the evolutionary history of jawed vertebrates.

AB  - In a proteogenomic approach based on tandem mass spectrometry analysis of proteolytic peptide mixtures, customized exome or RNA-seq databases are employed for identifying protein sequence variants. However, the problem of variant peptide identification without personalized genomic data is important for a variety of applications. Following the recent proposal by Chick et al. (Nat. Biotechnol. 33, 743-749, 2015) on the feasibility of such variant peptide search, we evaluated two available approaches based on the previously suggested "open" search and the "brute-force" strategy. To improve the efficiency of these approaches, we propose an algorithm for exclusion of false variant identifications from the search results involving analysis of modifications mimicking single amino acid substitutions. Also, we propose a de novo based scoring scheme for assessment of identified point mutations. In the scheme, the search engine analyzes y-type fragment ions in MS/MS spectra to confirm the location of the mutation in the variant peptide sequence.

AB  - Purpose: Exome sequencing and diagnosis is beginning to spread across the medical establishment. The most time-consuming part of genome-based diagnosis is the manual step of matching the potentially long list of patient candidate genes to patient phenotypes to identify the causative disease. Methods: We introduce Phrank (for phenotype ranking), an information theory-inspired method that utilizes a Bayesian network to prioritize candidate diseases or genes, as a stand-alone module that can be run with any underlying knowledgebase and any variant filtering scheme. Results: Phrank outperforms existing methods at ranking the causative disease or gene when applied to 169 real patient exomes with Mendelian diagnoses. Phrank's greatest improvement is in disease space, where across all 169 patients it ranks only 3 diseases on average ahead of the true diagnosis, whereas Phenomizer ranks 32 diseases ahead of the causal one. Conclusions: Using Phrank to rank all patient candidate genes or diseases, as they start working through a new case, will save the busy clinician much time in deriving a genetic diagnosis.

AB  - Accurate determination of the genetic diversity present in the HIV quasispecies is critical for the development of a preventative vaccine: in particular, little is known about viral genetic diversity for the second type of HIV, HIV-2. A better understanding of HIV-2 biology is relevant to the HIV vaccine field because a substantial proportion of infected people experience long-term viral control, and prior HIV-2 infection has been associated with slower HIV-1 disease progression in coinfected subjects. The majority of traditional and next-generation sequencing methods have relied on target amplification prior to sequencing, introducing biases that may obscure the true signals of diversity in the viral population. Additionally, target enrichment through PCR requires a priori sequence knowledge, which is lacking for HIV-2. Therefore, a target enrichment free method of library preparation would be valuable for the field. We applied an RNA shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) method without PCR amplification to cultured viral stocks and patient plasma samples from HIV-2-infected individuals. Libraries generated from total plasma RNA were analyzed with a two-step pipeline: (i) de novo genome assembly, followed by (ii) read remapping. By this approach, whole-genome sequences were generated with a 28X to 67X mean depth of coverage. Assembled reads showed a low level of GC bias, and comparison of the genome diversities at the intrahost level showed low diversity in the accessory gene vpx in all patients. Our study demonstrates that RNA-Seq is a feasible full-genome de novo sequencing method for blood plasma samples collected from HIV-2-infected individuals. IMPORTANCE An accurate picture of viral genetic diversity is critical for the development of a globally effective HIV vaccine. However, sequencing strategies are often complicated by target enrichment prior to sequencing, introducing biases that can distort variant frequencies, which are not easily corrected for in downstream analyses. Additionally, detailed a priori sequence knowledge is needed to inform robust primer design when employing PCR amplification, a factor that is often lacking when working with tropical diseases localized in developing countries. Previous work has demonstrated that direct RNA shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) can be used to circumvent these issues for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and norovirus. We applied RNA-Seq to total RNA extracted from HIV-2 blood plasma samples, demonstrating the applicability of this technique to HIV-2 and allowing us to generate a dynamic picture of genetic diversity over the whole genome of HIV-2 in the context of low-bias sequencing.

AB  - Splice variants are known to be important in the pathophysiology of tumors, including the brain cancers. We applied a proteogenomics pipeline to identify splice variants in glioblastoma (GBM, grade IV glioma), a highly malignant brain tumor, using in-house generated mass spectrometric proteomic data and public domain RNASeq dataset. Our analysis led to the identification of a novel exon that maps to the long isoform of Neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1), expressed on the surface of glial cells and neurons, important for cell adhesion and cell signaling. The presence of the novel exon is supported with the identification of five peptides spanning it. Additional peptides were also detected in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel separated proteins from GBM patient tissue, underscoring the presence of the novel peptides in the intact brain protein. The novel exon was detected in the RNASeq dataset in 18 of 25 GBM samples and separately validated in additional 10 GBM tumor tissues using quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Both transcriptomic and proteomic data indicate downregulation of NCAM1, including the novel variant, in GBM. Domain analysis of the novel NCAM1 sequence indicates that the insertion of the novel exon contributes extra low-complexity region in the protein that may be important for protein-protein interactions and hence for cell signaling associated with tumor development. Taken together, the novel NCAM1 variant reported in this study exemplifies the importance of future multiomics research and systems biology applications in GBM.

AB  - Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences which are capable of moving from one location to another and represent a large proportion (45%) of the human genome. TEs have functional roles in a variety of biological phenomena such as cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and aging. Rapid development in RNA-sequencing technology has enabled us, for the first time, to study the activity of TE at the systems level. However, efficient TE analysis tools are not yet developed. In this work, we developed SalmonTE, a fast and reliable pipeline for the quantification of TEs from RNA-seq data. We benchmarked our tool against TEtranscripts, a widely used TE quantification method, and three other quantification methods using several RNA-seq datasets from Drosophila melanogaster and human cell-line. We achieved 20 times faster execution speed without compromising the accuracy. This pipeline will enable the biomedical research community to quantify and analyze TEs from large amounts of data and lead to novel TE centric discoveries.

AB  - Over the last decade, a large number of nucleotide sequences have been generated by next-generation sequencing technologies and deposited to public databases. However, most of these datasets do not specify the sex of individuals sampled because researchers typically ignore or hide this information. Male and female genomes in many species have distinctive sex chromosomes, XX/XY and ZW/ZZ, and expression levels of many sex-related genes differ between the sexes. Herein, we describe how to develop sex marker sequences from syntenic regions of sex chromosomes and use them to quickly identify the sex of individuals being analyzed. Array-based technologies routinely use either known sex markers or the B-allele frequency of X or Z chromosomes to deduce the sex of an individual. The same strategy has been used with whole-exome/genome sequence data; however, all reads must be aligned onto a reference genome to determine the B-allele frequency of the X or Z chromosomes. SEXCMD is a pipeline that can extract sex marker sequences from reference sex chromosomes and rapidly identify the sex of individuals from whole-exome/genome and RNA sequencing after training with a known dataset through a simple machine learning approach. The pipeline counts total numbers of hits from sex-specific marker sequences and identifies the sex of the individuals sampled based on the fact that XX/ZZ samples do not have Y or W chromosome hits. We have successfully validated our pipeline with mammalian (Homo sapiens; XY) and avian (Gallus gallus; ZW) genomes. Typical calculation time when applying SEXCMD to human whole-exome or RNA sequencing datasets is a few minutes, and analyzing human whole-genome datasets takes about 10 minutes. Another important application of SEXCMD is as a quality control measure to avoid mixing samples before bioinformatics analysis. SEXCMD comprises simple Python and R scripts and is freely available at https://github. com/lovemun/SEXCMD.

AB  - Motivation: Advancements in sequencing technologies have highlighted the role of alternative splicing (AS) in increasing transcriptome complexity. This role of AS, combined with the relation of aberrant splicing to malignant states, motivated two streams of research, experimental and computational. The first involves a myriad of techniques such as RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq to identify splicing regulators and their putative targets. The second involves probabilistic models, also known as splicing codes, which infer regulatory mechanisms and predict splicing outcome directly from genomic sequence. To date, these models have utilized only expression data. In this work, we address two related challenges: Can we improve on previous models for AS outcome prediction and can we integrate additional sources of data to improve predictions for AS regulatory factors. Results: We perform a detailed comparison of two previous modeling approaches, Bayesian and Deep Neural networks, dissecting the confounding effects of datasets and target functions. We then develop a new target function for AS prediction in exon skipping events and show it significantly improves model accuracy. Next, we develop a modeling framework that leverages transfer learning to incorporate CLIP-Seq, knockdown and over expression experiments, which are inherently noisy and suffer from missing values. Using several datasets involving key splice factors in mouse brain, muscle and heart we demonstrate both the prediction improvements and biological insights offered by our new models. Overall, the framework we propose offers a scalable integrative solution to improve splicing code modeling as vast amounts of relevant genomic data become available.

AB  - Improved knowledge about plant cold stress tolerance offered by modern omics technologies will greatly inform future crop improvement strategies that aim to breed cultivars yielding substantially high under low-temperature conditions. Alarmingly rising temperature extremities present a substantial impediment to the projected target of 70% more food production by 2050. Low-temperature (LT) stress severely constrains crop production worldwide, thereby demanding an urgent yet sustainable solution. Considerable research progress has been achieved on this front. Here, we review the crucial cellular and metabolic alterations in plants that follow LT stress along with the signal transduction and the regulatory network describing the plant cold tolerance. The significance of plant genetic resources to expand the genetic base of breeding programmes with regard to cold tolerance is highlighted. Also, the genetic architecture of cold tolerance trait as elucidated by conventional QTL mapping and genome-wide association mapping is described. Further, global expression profiling techniques including RNA-Seq along with diverse omics platforms are briefly discussed to better understand the underlying mechanism and prioritize the candidate gene (s) for downstream applications. These latest additions to breeders' toolbox hold immense potential to support plant breeding schemes that seek development of LT-tolerant cultivars. High-yielding cultivars endowed with greater cold tolerance are urgently required to sustain the crop yield under conditions severely challenged by low-temperature.

AB  - Advancing the clinical utility of whole-exome sequencing (WES) for patients with suspected genetic disorders is largely driven by bioinformatics approaches that streamline data processing and analysis. Herein, we describe our experience with implementing a semiautomated and phenotype-driven WES diagnostic workflow, incorporating both the DRAGEN pipeline and the Exomiser variant prioritization tool, at an academic children's hospital with an ethnically diverse pediatric patient population. We achieved a 41% molecular diagnostic rate for 66 duo-, quad-, or trio-WES cases, and 28% for 40 singleton-WES cases. Preliminary results were returned to ordering physicians within 1 wk for 12 of 38 (32%) probands with positive findings, which were instrumental in guiding the appropriate clinical management for a variety of patients, especially in critical care settings. The semiautomated and streamlined WES workflow also enabled us to identify novel variants in candidate disease genes in patients with developmental delay and autism and immune disorders and cancer, including ANK2, BPTF, BCL11A, FOXN1, PLAA, ATRX, DNAJC21, and RAD50. Together, we demonstrated the implementation of a streamlined WES workflow that was successfully applied for both clinical and research purposes.

AB  - Recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible to measure RNA expression at the single-cell level, thus paving the way for exploring expression heterogeneity among individual cells. Current single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocols are complex and introduce technical biases that vary across cells, which can bias downstream analysis without proper adjustment. To account for cell-to-cell technical differences, we propose a statistical framework, TASC (Toolkit for Analysis of Single Cell RNA-seq), an empirical Bayes approach to reliably model the cell-specific dropout rates and amplification bias by use of external RNA spike-ins. TASC incorporates the technical parameters, which reflect cell-to-cell batch effects, into a hierarchical mixture model to estimate the biological variance of a gene and detect differentially expressed genes. More importantly, TASC is able to adjust for covariates to further eliminate confounding that may originate from cell size and cell cycle differences. In simulation and real scRNA-seq data, TASC achieves accurate Type I error control and displays competitive sensitivity and improved robustness to batch effects in differential expression analysis, compared to existing methods. TASC is programmed to be computationally efficient, taking advantage of multi-threaded parallelization. We believe that TASC will provide a robust platform for researchers to leverage the power of scRNA-seq.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging species of mRNA splicing products with largely unknown functions. Although several computational pipelines for circRNA identification have been developed, these methods strictly rely on uniquely mapped reads overlapping back-splice junctions (BSJs) and lack approaches to model the statistical significatnce of the identified circRNAs by simultaneously utilizing BSJ overlapping reads and discordant BSJ spanning reads to identify circRNAs. Moreover, we developed a novel procedure to estimate the P-values of the identified circRNAs. A computational cross-validation and experimental validations demonstrated that our ethod performed favorably compared to existing circRNA detection tools. We created a standalone tool, CircRNAFisher to implement the method which might be valuable to computational and experimental scientists studying circRNAs.

AB  - Single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing has recently been used to obtain full-length cDNA sequences that improve genome annotation and reveal RNA isoforms. Here, we used one such method called isoform sequencing from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) to sequence a cDNA library from the Asian malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi. More than 600000 full-length cDNAs, referred to as reads of insert, were identified. Owing to the inherently high error rate of PacBio sequencing, we tested different approaches for error correction. We found that error correction using Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) generated more data than using the default SMRT pipeline. The full-length error-corrected PacBio reads greatly improved the gene annotation of Anopheles stephensi: 4867 gene models were updated and 1785 alternatively spliced isoforms were added to the annotation. In addition, six trans-splicing events, where exons from different primary transcripts were joined together, were identified in An.stephensi. All six trans-splicing events appear to be conserved in Culicidae, as they are also found in Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti. The proteins encoded by trans-splicing events are also highly conserved and the orthologues of these proteins are cis-spliced in outgroup species, indicating that trans-splicing may arise as a mechanism to rescue genes that broke up during evolution.

AB  - The current DNA sequencing technologies and their high-throughput yield, allowed the thrive of genomic and transcriptomic experiments but it also have generated big data problem. Due to this exponential growth of sequencing data, also the complexity of managing, processing and interpreting it in order to generate results, has raised. Therefore, the demand of easy-to-use friendly software and websites to run bioinformatic tools is imminent. In particular, RNA-Seq and differential expression analysis have become a popular and useful method to evaluate the genetic expression change in any organism. However, many scientists struggle with the data analysis since most of the available tools are implemented in a UNIX-based environment. Therefore, we have developed the web server IDEAMEX (Integrative Differential Expression Analysis for Multiple EXperiments). The IDEAMEX pipeline needs a raw count table for as many desired replicates and conditions, allowing the user to select which conditions will be compared, instead of doing all-vs.-all comparisons. The whole process consists of three main steps (1) Data Analysis: that allows a preliminary analysis for quality control based on the data distribution per sample, using different types of graphs; (2) Differential expression: performs the differential expression analysis with or without batch effect error awareness, using the bioconductor packages, NOISeq, limma-Voom, DESeg2 and edgeR, and generate reports for each method; (3) Result integration: the obtained results the integrated results are reported using different graphical outputs such as correlograms, heatmaps, Venn diagrams and text lists. Our server allows an easy and friendly visualization for results, providing an easy interaction during the analysis process, as well as error tracking and debugging by providing output log files. The server is currently available and can be accessed at http://www.uusmb.unam.mx/ideamex/where the documentation and example input files are provided. We consider that this web server can help other researchers with no previous bioinformatic knowledge, to perform their analyses in a simple manner.

AB  - PURPOSE. Our goal was to describe the clinical and molecular genetic findings in Thai patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). METHODS. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in eight unrelated patients. All genes responsible for inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) based on RetNet were selected for analysis. Potentially causative variants were filtered through a bioinformatics pipeline and validated using Sanger sequencing. Segregation analysis of the causative genes was performed in family members when available. RESULTS. Eleven deleterious variants, six nonsense and five missense, were identified in seven genes: four LCA-associated genes (CEP290, IQCB1, NMNAT1, and RPGRIP1), one gene responsible for syndromic LCA (ALMS1), and two IRDs-related genes (CTNNA1 and CYP4V2). Clinical reassessment supported the diagnosis of syndromic LCA in those patients harboring potentially pathogenic variants in the ALMS1. Interestingly, two causative genes, CTNNA1 and CYP4V2, previously reported to cause butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy (BSPD) and Bietti's crystalline dystrophy (BCD), respectively, were detected in two other patients. These two patients developed rapid and severe visual loss in contrast to BSPD and BCD patients in previous studies. The results of this study demonstrate that causative variants identified in the CTNNA1 and CYP4V2 genes are also associated with LCA. CONCLUSIONS. This is the first report describing the molecular genetics and clinical manifestations of Thai patients with LCA. The present study expands the spectrum of LCA-associated genes, which is a benefit for molecular diagnosis. The identification of mutations in the CTNNA1 and CYP4V2 genes requires further elucidation in larger cohorts with LCA.

AB  - Background The most common and severe disease causing allele of Alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency (1ATD) is Z-1AT. This protein aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is the main cause of liver disease in childhood. Based on recent evidences and on the frequency of liver disease occurrence in Z-1AT patients, it seems that liver disease progression is linked to still unknown genetic factors. Methods We used an innovative approach combining yeast genetic screens with next generation exome sequencing to identify and functionally characterize the genes involved in 1ATD associated liver disease. Results Using yeast genetic screens, we identified HRD1, an Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD) associated protein, as an inducer of Z-mediated toxicity. Whole exome sequencing of 1ATD patients resulted in the identification of two variants associated with liver damages in Z-1AT homozygous cases: HFE H63D and HERPUD1 R50H. Functional characterization in Z-1AT model cell lines demonstrated that impairment of the ERAD machinery combined with the HFE H63D variant expression decreased both cell proliferation and cell viability, while Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)-mediated cell death was hyperstimulated. Conclusion This powerful experimental pipeline allowed us to identify and functionally validate two genes involved in Z-1AT-mediated severe liver toxicity. This pilot study moves forward our understanding on genetic modifiers involved in 1ATD and highlights the UPR pathway as a target for the treatment of liver diseases associated with 1ATD. Finally, these findings support a larger scale screening for HERPUD1 R50H and HFE H63D variants in the sub-group of 1ATD patients developing significant chronic hepatic injuries (hepatomegaly, chronic cholestasis, elevated liver enzymes) and at risk developing liver cirrhosis.

AB  - Most antibiotics were discovered by screening soil actinomycetes, but the efficiency of the discovery platform collapsed in the 1960s. By now, more than 3000 antibiotics have been described and most of the current discovery effort is focused on the rediscovery of known compounds, making the approach impractical. The last marketed broad-spectrum antibiotics discovered were daptomycin, linezolid, and fidaxomicin. The current state of the art in the development of new anti-infectives is a non-existent pipeline in the absence of a discovery platform. This is particularly troubling given the emergence of pan-resistant pathogens. The current practice in dealing with the problem of the background of known compounds is to use chemical dereplication of extracts to assess the relative novelty of a compound it contains. Dereplication typically requires scale-up, extraction, and often fractionation before an accurate mass and structure can be produced by MS analysis in combination with 2D NMR. Here, we describe a transcriptome analysis approach using RNA sequencing (RNASeq) to identify promising novel antimicrobial compounds from microbial extracts. Our pipeline permits identification of antimicrobial compounds that produce distinct transcription profiles using unfractionated cell extracts. This efficient pipeline will eliminate the requirement for purification and structure determination of compounds from extracts and will facilitate high-throughput screen of cell extracts for identification of novel compounds.

AB  - Viruses cause significant yield and quality losses in a wide variety of cultivated crops. Hence, the detection and identification of viruses is a crucial facet of successful crop production and of great significance in terms of world food security. Whilst the adoption of molecular techniques such as RT-PCR has increased the speed and accuracy of viral diagnostics, such techniques only allow the detection of known viruses, i.e., each test is specific to one or a small number of related viruses. Therefore, unknown viruses can be missed and testing can be slow and expensive if molecular tests are unavailable. Methods for simultaneous detection of multiple viruses have been developed, and (NGS) is now a principal focus of this area, as it enables unbiased and hypothesis-free testing of plant samples. The development of NGS protocols capable of detecting multiple known and emergent viruses present in infected material is proving to be a major advance for crops, nuclear stocks or imported plants and germplasm, in which disease symptoms are absent, unspecific or only triggered by multiple viruses. Researchers want to answer the question "how many different viruses are present in this crop plant?" without knowing what they are looking for: RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of plant material allows this question to be addressed. As well as needing efficient nucleic acid extraction and enrichment protocols, virus detection using RNA-seq requires fast and robust bioinformatics methods to enable host sequence removal and virus classification. In this review recent studies that use RNA-seq for virus detection in a variety of crop plants are discussed with specific emphasis on the computational methods implemented. The main features of a number of specific bioinformatics workflows developed for virus detection from NGS data are also outlined and possible reasons why these have not yet been widely adopted are discussed. The review concludes by discussing the future directions of this field, including the use of bioinformatics tools for virus detection deployed in analytical environments using cloud computing.

AB  - Purpose: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) represents a large group of inherited retinal diseases characterized by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Among patients with RP in northern Sweden, we identified two severely affected siblings and aimed to reveal a genetic cause underlying their disease. Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on both affected individuals. Sequence variants were filtered using a custom pipeline to find a rare or novel variant predicted to affect protein function. Genome-wide genotyping was used to identify copy number variants (CNVs) and homozygous regions with potential disease causative genes. Results: WES uncovered a novel heterozygous variant in the MER proto-oncogene, tyrosine kinase (MERTK) gene, c.2309A>G, p.Glu770Gly located in the tyrosine kinase domain and predicted to be likely pathogenic. The second variant, a large heterozygous deletion encompassing exons 1 to 7 of the MERTK gene, was revealed with genome-wide genotyping. The CNV analysis suggested breakpoints of the deletion, in the 5'-untranslated region and in intron 7. We identified genomic sequences at the site of the deletion as part of L1ME4b (LINE/L1) and AluSx3 that indicated a non-homologous recombination as a mechanism of the deletion evolvement. Conclusions: Patients with RP in this study were carriers of two novel allelic mutations in the MERTK gene, a missense variant in exon 17 and an approximate 91 kb genomic deletion. Mapping of the deletion breakpoints allowed molecular testing of a cohort of patients with RP with allele-specific PCR. These findings provide additional information about mutations in MERTK for molecular testing of unsolved recessive RP cases and highlight the necessity for analysis of large genomic deletions.

AB  - BackgroundsNext-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is now widely used in biomedical research for various applications. Processing of NGS data requires multiple programs and customization of the processing pipelines according to the data platforms. However, rapid progress of the NGS applications and processing methods urgently require prompt update of the pipelines. Recent clinical applications of NGS technology such as cell-free DNA, cancer panel, or exosomal RNA sequencing data also require appropriate customization of the processing pipelines. Here, we developed SEQprocess, a highly extendable framework that can provide standard as well as customized pipelines for NGS data processing.ResultsSEQprocess was implemented in an R package with fully modularized steps for data processing that can be easily customized. Currently, six pre-customized pipelines are provided that can be easily executed by non-experts such as biomedical scientists, including the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) pipelines as well as the popularly used pipelines for variant calling (e.g., GATK) and estimation of allele frequency, RNA abundance (e.g., TopHat2/Cufflink), or DNA copy numbers (e.g., Sequenza). In addition, optimized pipelines for the clinical sequencing from cell-free DNA or miR-Seq are also provided. The processed data were transformed into R package-compatible data type ExpressionSet' or SummarizedExperiment', which could facilitate subsequent data analysis within R environment. Finally, an automated report summarizing the processing steps are also provided to ensure reproducibility of the NGS data analysis.ConclusionSEQprocess provides a highly extendable and R compatible framework that can manage customized and reproducible pipelines for handling multiple legacy NGS processing tools.

AB  - Global quantification of total RNA is used to investigate steady state levels of gene expression. However, being able to differentiate pre-existing RNA (that has been synthesized prior to a defined point in time) and newly transcribed RNA can provide invaluable information e.g. to estimate RNA half-lives or identify fast and complex regulatory processes. Recently, new techniques based on metabolic labeling and RNA-seq have emerged that allow to quantify new and old RNA: Nucleoside analogs are incorporated into newly transcribed RNA and are made detectable as point mutations in mapped reads. However, relatively infrequent incorporation events and significant sequencing error rates make the differentiation between old and new RNA a highly challenging task. We developed a statistical approach termed GRAND-SLAM that, for the first time, allows to estimate the proportion of old and new RNA in such an experiment. Uncertainty in the estimates is quantified in a Bayesian framework. Simulation experiments show our approach to be unbiased and highly accurate. Furthermore, we analyze how uncertainty in the proportion translates into uncertainty in estimating RNA half-lives and give guidelines for planning experiments. Finally, we demonstrate that our estimates of RNA half-lives compare favorably to other experimental approaches and that biological processes affecting RNA half-lives can be investigated with greater power than offered by any other method. GRAND-SLAM is freely available for non-commercial use at http://software.erhard-lab.de; R scripts to generate all figures are available at zenodo (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1162340).

AB  - Background: Ginseng is a popular traditional herbal medicine in north-eastern Asia. It has been used for human health for over thousands of years. With the rise in global temperature, the production of Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) in Korea have migrated from mid to northern parts of the Korean peninsula to escape from the various higher temperature related stresses. Under the high ambient temperature, vegetative growth was accelerated, which resulted in early flowering. This precocious phase change led to yield loss. Despite of its importance as a traditional medicine, biological mechanisms of ginseng has not been well studied and even the genome sequence of ginseng is yet to be determined due to its complex genome structure. Thus, it is challenging to investigate the molecular biology mechanisms at the transcript level. Results: To investigate how ginseng responds to the high ambient temperature environment, we performed high throughput RNA sequencing and implemented a bioinformatics pipeline for the integrated analysis of small-RNA and mRNA-seq data without a reference genome. By performing reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR and sanger sequencing of transcripts that were assembled using our pipeline, we validated that their sequences were expressed in our samples. Furthermore, to investigate the interaction between genes and non-coding small RNAs and their regulation status under the high ambient temperature, we identified potential gene regulatory miRNAs. As a result, 100,672 contigs with significant expression level were identified and 6 known, 214 conserved and 60 potential novel miRNAs were predicted to be expressed under the high ambient temperature. Conclusion: Collectively, we have found that development, flowering and temperature responsive genes were induced under high ambient temperature, whereas photosynthesis related genes were repressed. Functional miRNAs were down-regulated under the high ambient temperature. Among them are miR156 and miR396 that target flowering (SPL6/9) and growth regulating genes (GRF) respectively.

AB  - Motivation: Analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data in human saliva is challenging. Lack of standardization and unification of the bioinformatic procedures undermines saliva's diagnostic potential. Thus, it motivated us to perform this study. Results: We applied principal pipelines for bioinformatic analysis of small RNA-Seq data of saliva of 98 healthy Korean volunteers including either direct or indirect mapping of the reads to the human genome using Bowtie1. Analysis of alignments to exogenous genomes by another pipeline revealed that almost all of the reads map to bacterial genomes. Thus, salivary exRNA has fundamental properties that warrant the design of unique additional steps while performing the bioinformatic analysis. Our pipelines can serve as potential guidelines for processing of RNA-Seq data of human saliva. Availability and implementation: Processing and analysis results of the experimental data generated by the exceRpt (v4.6.3) small RNA-seq pipeline (github.gersteinlab.org/exceRpt) are available from exRNA atlas (exrna-atlas.org). Alignment to exogenous genomes and their quantification results were used in this paper for the analyses of small RNAs of exogenous origin. Contact: dtww@ucla.edu

AB  - Previously, we reported that infection of human macrophages with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) results in massive alterations in the pattern of RNA splicing in the host. The finding gained significance since alternate spliced variants of a same gene may have substantially different structure, function, stability, interaction partners, localization, and so forth, owing to inclusion or exclusion of specific exons. To establish a proof-of-concept; on how infection-induced RNA splicing could impact protein functions, here we used RNA-seq data from THP-1 macrophages that were infected with clinical isolate of Mtb. In addition to re-establishing the fact that Mtb infection may cause strain specific alterations in RNA splicing, we also developed a new analysis pipeline resulting in characterization of domain maps of the transcriptome post-infection. For the sake of simplicity, we restricted our analysis to all the kinases in the human genome and considered only pfam classified protein domains and checked their frequency of inclusion or exclusion due to alternate splicing across the conditions and time points. We report massive alterations in the domain architecture of most regulated proteins across the entire kinases highlighting the physiological importance of such an understanding. This study paves way for more detailed analysis of different functional classes of proteins and perturbations to their domain architecture as a consequence of mycobacterial infections. Such analysis would yield unprecedented depth to our understanding of host-pathogen interaction and allow in a more systematic manner targeting of host pathways for controlling the infections.

AB  - The quest for tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and neoantigens is a major focus of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we combine a neoantigen prediction pipeline and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) peptidomics to identify TAAs and neoantigens in 16 tumors derived from seven patients with melanoma and characterize their interactions with their tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Our investigation of the antigenic and T-cell landscapes encompassing the TAA and neoantigen signatures, their immune reactivity, and their corresponding T-cell identities provides the first comprehensive analysis of cancer cell T-cell cosignatures, allowing us to discover remarkable antigenic and TIL similarities between metastases from the same patient. Furthermore, we reveal that two neoantigen-specific clonotypes killed 90% of autologous melanoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo, showing that a limited set of neoantigen-specific T cells may play a central role in melanoma tumor rejection. Our findings indicate that combining HLA peptidomics with neoantigen predictions allows robust identification of targetable neoantigens, which could successfully guide personalized cancer immunotherapies. SIGNIFICANCE: As neoantigen targeting is becoming more established as a powerful therapeutic approach, investigating these molecules has taken center stage. Here, we show that a limited set of neoantigen-specific T cells mediates tumor rejection, suggesting that identifying just a few antigens and their corresponding T-cell clones could guide personalized immunotherapy.

AB  - Background: The Antarctic intertidal zone is continuously subjected to extremely fluctuating biotic and abiotic stressors. The West Antarctic Peninsula is the most rapidly warming region on Earth. Organisms living in Antarctic intertidal pools are therefore interesting for research into evolutionary adaptation to extreme environments and the effects of climate change. Findings: We report the whole genome sequence of the Antarctic-endemic harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus kingsejongensi. The 37 Gb raw DNA sequence was generated using the Illumina Miseq platform. Libraries were prepared with 65-fold coverage and a total length of 295 Mb. The final assembly consists of 48 368 contigs with an N50 contig length of 17.5 kb, and 27 823 scaffolds with an N50 contig length of 159.2 kb. A total of 12 772 coding genes were inferred using the MAKER annotation pipeline. Comparative genome analysis revealed that T. kingsejongensis-specific genes are enriched in transport and metabolism processes. Furthermore, rapidly evolving genes related to energy metabolism showed positive selection signatures. Conclusions: The T. kingsejongensis genome provides an interesting example of an evolutionary strategy for Antarctic cold adaptation, and offers new genetic insights into Antarctic intertidal biota.

AB  - Novel transcript discovery through RNA sequencing has substantially improved our understanding of the transcriptome dynamics of biological systems. Endogenous target mimicry (eTM) transcripts, a novel class of regulatory molecules, bind to their target microRNAs (miRNAs) by base pairing and block their biological activity. The objective of this study was to provide a computational analysis framework for the prediction of putative eTM sequences in plants, and as an example, to discover previously un-annotated eTMs in Prunus persica (peach) transcriptome. Therefore, two public peach transcriptome libraries downloaded from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and a previously published set of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were investigated with multi-step analysis pipeline, and 44 putative eTMs were found. Additionally, an eTM-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network module associated with peach fruit organ development was built via integration of the miRNA target information and predicted eTM-miRNA interactions. My findings suggest that one of the most widely expressed miRNA families among diverse plant species, miR156, might be potentially sponged by seven putative eTMs. Besides, the study indicates eTMs potentially play roles in the regulation of development processes in peach fruit via targeting specific miRNAs. In conclusion, by following the step-by step instructions provided in this study, novel eTMs can be identified and annotated effectively in public plant transcriptome libraries.

AB  - The importance of neoantigens for cancer immunity is now well-acknowledged. However, there are diverse strategies for predicting and prioritizing candidate neoantigens, and thus reported neoantigen loads vary a great deal. To clarify this issue, we compared the numbers of neoantigen candidates predicted by four currently utilized strategies. Whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of four non-small-cell lung cancer patients was carried out. We identified 361 somatic missense mutations from which 224 candidate neoantigens were predicted using MHC class I binding affinity prediction software (strategy I). Of these, 207 exceeded the set threshold of gene expression (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped 1), resulting in 124 candidate neoantigens (strategy II). To verify mutant mRNA expression, sequencing of amplicons from tumor cDNA including each mutation was undertaken; 204 of the 207 mutations were successfully sequenced, yielding 121 mutant mRNA sequences, resulting in 75 candidate neoantigens (strategy III). Sequence information was extracted from RNA-Seq to confirm the presence of mutated mRNA. Variant allele frequencies 0.04 in RNA-Seq were found for 117 of the 207 mutations and regarded as expressed in the tumor, and finally, 72 candidate neoantigens were predicted (strategy IV). Without additional amplicon sequencing of cDNA, strategy IV was comparable to strategy III. We therefore propose strategy IV as a practical and appropriate strategy to predict candidate neoantigens fully utilizing currently available information. It is of note that different neoantigen loads were deduced from the same tumors depending on the strategies applied.

AB  - Understanding the role of short-interfering RNA (siRNA) in diverse biological processes is of current interest and often approached through small RNA sequencing. However, analysis of these datasets is difficult due to the complexity of biological RNA processing pathways, which differ between species. Several properties like strand specificity, length distribution, and distribution of soft-dipped bases are few parameters known to guide researchers in understanding the role of siRNAs. We present RAPID, a generic eukaryotic siRNA analysis pipeline, which captures information inherent in the datasets and automatically produces numerous visualizations as user-friendly HTML reports, covering multiple categories required for siRNA analysis. RAPID also facilitates an automated comparison of multiple datasets, with one of the normalization techniques dedicated for siRNA knockdown analysis, and integrates differential expression analysis using DESeq2.

AB  - Background: Feed intake and body weight gain are economically important inputs and outputs of beef production systems. The purpose of this study was to discover differentially expressed genes that will be robust for feed intake and gain across a large segment of the cattle industry. Transcriptomic studies often suffer from issues with reproducibility and cross validation. One way to improve reproducibility is by integrating multiple datasets via meta analysis. RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) was performed on longissimus dorsi muscle from 80 steers (5 cohorts, each with 16 animals) selected from the outside fringe of a bivariate gain and feed intake distribution to understand the genes and pathways involved in feed efficiency. In each cohort, 16 steers were selected from one of four gain and feed intake phenotypes (n =4 per phenotype) in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with gain and feed intake as main effect variables. Each cohort was analyzed as a single experiment using a generalized linear mode and results from the 5 cohort analyses were combined in a meta-analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) across the cohorts. Results: A total of 51 genes were differentially expressed for the main effect of gain, 109 genes for the intake main effect, and 11 genes for the gain x intake interaction (P-COrrected < 0.05). A jackknife sensitivity analysis showed that, in general, the meta analysis produced robust DEGs for the two main effects and their interaction. Pathways identified from over represented genes included mitochondrial energy production and oxidative stress pathways for the main effect of gain due to DEG including GPD1, NDUFA6, UQCRQ, ACTC1, and MGST3. For intake, metabolic pathways including amino acid biosynthesis and degradation were identified, and for the interaction analysis the pathways identified included GADD45, pyridoxa ! 5'phosphate salvage, and caveolar mediated endocytosis signaling. Conclusions: Variation among DEG identified by cohort suggests that environment and breed may play large roles in the expression of genes associated with feed efficiency in the muscle of beef cattle. Meta-analyses of transcriptome data from groups of animals over multiple cohorts may be necessary to elucidate the genetics contributing these types of biological phenotypes.

AB  - Chromatin alterations mediate mutations and gene expression changes in cancer. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has been utilized to study genome-wide chromatin structure in human cancer cell lines, yet numerous technical challenges limit comparable analyses in primary tumors. Here we have developed a new whole-genome analytic pipeline to optimize ChIP-Seq protocols on patient-derived xeno-grafts from human papillomavirus-related (HPV+) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples. We further associated chromatin aberrations with gene expression changes from a larger cohort of the tumor and normal samples with RNA-Seq data. We detect differential histone enrichment associated with tumor-specific gene expression variation, sites of HPV integration in the human genome, and HPV-associated histone enrichment sites upstream of cancer driver genes, which play central roles in cancer-associated pathways. These comprehensive analyses enable unprecedented characterization of the complex network of molecular changes resulting from chromatin alterations that drive HPV-related tumorigenesis.

AB  - Ensembl Genomes (http://www.ensemblgenomes.org) is an integrating resource for genome-scale data from non-vertebrate species, complementing the resources for vertebrate genomics developed in the Ensembl project (http://www.ensembl.org). Together, the two resources provide a consistent set of programmatic and interactive interfaces to a rich range of data including genome sequence, gene models, transcript sequence, genetic variation, and comparative analysis. This paper provides an update to the previous publications about the resource, with a focus on recent developments and expansions. These include the incorporation of almost 20 000 additional genome sequences and over 35 000 tracks of RNA-Seq data, which have been aligned to genomic sequence and made available for visualization. Other advances since 2015 include the release of the database in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, a large increase in community-derived curation, a new high-performance protein sequence search, additional cross-references, improved annotation of non-protein-coding genes, and the launch of pre-release and archival sites. Collectively, these changes are part of a continuing response to the increasing quantity of publicly-available genome-scale data, and the consequent need to archive, integrate, annotate and disseminate these using automated, scalable methods.

AB  - BackgroundA range of rare and common genetic variants have been discovered to be potentially associated with mental diseases, but many more have not been uncovered. Powerful integrative methods are needed to systematically prioritize both variants and genes that confer susceptibility to mental diseases in personal genomes of individual patients and to facilitate the development of personalized treatment or therapeutic approaches.MethodsLeveraging deep neural network on the TensorFlow framework, we developed a computational tool, integrated Mental-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), for analyzing whole genome/exome sequencing data on personal genomes. iMEGES takes as input genetic mutations and phenotypic information from a patient with mental disorders, and outputs the rank of whole genome susceptibility variants and the prioritized disease-specific genes for mental disorders by integrating contributions from coding and non-coding variants, structural variants (SVs), known brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and epigenetic information from PsychENCODE.ResultsiMEGES was evaluated on multiple datasets of mental disorders, and it achieved improved performance than competing approaches when large training dataset is available.ConclusioniMEGES can be used in population studies to help the prioritization of novel genes or variants that might be associated with the susceptibility to mental disorders, and also on individual patients to help the identification of genes or variants related to mental diseases.

AB  - Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis is a severe fatal disorder with an average incidence of around 1:250,000. It is diagnosed soon after birth or within the 1st year of life with severe symptoms of abnormal bone remodelling. This study was aimed to identify the underlying genetic cause of the disease in a Pakistani family segregating infantile malignant osteopetrosis in autosomal recessive pattern. Whole exome sequencing of the proband was performed using the 51 Mb SureSelect V4 library kit and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing system. The reads were analysed using standard bioinformatic data analysis pipeline. The genotype of candidate variants was confirmed in the proband and his normal parents by Sanger sequencing. Two novel homozygous missense variants were found in the same codon 204 of CLCN7 NM_001287.5:c.[610A > T;612C > G] predicting p.(Ser204Trp) variant in the protein. Sanger sequencing and RFLP assay verified that both these variants were heterozygous in the unaffected parents. Moreover, these variants were not detected in the unrelated healthy Pakistani subjects (200 chromosomes), ExAC, dbSNP, or the 1000 Genomes Project data. Multiple bioinformatics tools unanimously predicted the p.(Ser204Trp) variant as deleterious. CLCN7 mutation p.(Ser204Trp) is the likely cause of the osteopetrosis disease in the Pakistani family. This study expands the restricted spectrum of CLCN7 mutations associated with infantile malignant osteopetrosis and indicates clinical significance of whole exome sequencing in the diagnosis of clinically and genetically heterogenous osteopetrosis phenotype. These data should be helpful in the improved genetic counselling, carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the affected family.

AB  - In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the decline in the glomerular filtration rate is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and thus poses a major challenge for healthcare systems. While the contribution of tissue-derived miRNAs and mRNAs to CKD progression has been extensively studied, little is known about the role of urinary exosomes and their association with CKD. Exosomes are small, membrane-derived endocytic vesicles that contribute to cell-to-cell communication and are present in various body fluids, such as blood or urine. Next-generation sequencing approaches have revealed that exosomes are enriched in noncoding RNAs and thus exhibit great potential for sensitive nucleic acid biomarkers in various human diseases. Therefore, in this study we aimed to identify urinary exosomal ncRNAs as novel biomarkers for diagnosis of CKD. Since up to now most approaches have focused on the class of miRNAs, we extended our analysis to several other noncoding RNA classes, such as tRNAs, tRNA fragments (tRFs), mitochondrial tRNAs, or lincRNAs. For their computational identification from RNA-seq data, we developed a novel computational pipeline, designated as ncRNASeqScan. By these analyses, in CKD patients we identified 30 differentially expressed ncRNAs, derived from urinary exosomes, as suitable biomarkers for early diagnosis. Thereby, miRNA-181a appeared as the most robust and stable potential biomarker, being significantly decreased by about 200-fold in exosomes of CKD patients compared to healthy controls. Using a cell culture system for CKD indicated that urinary exosomes might indeed originate from renal proximal tubular epithelial cells.

AB  - Background: Various insect species have been added to genomic databases over the years. Thus, researchers can easily obtain online genomic information on invertebrates and insects. However, many incorrectly annotated genes are included in these databases, which can prevent the correct interpretation of subsequent functional analyses. To address this problem, we used a combination of dry and wet bench processes to select functional genes from public databases. Results: Enolase is an important glycolytic enzyme in all organisms. We used a combination of dry and wet bench processes to identify functional enolases in the silkworm Bombyx mori (BmEno). First, we detected five annotated enolases from public databases using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) search, and then through cDNA cloning, Northern blotting, and RNA-seq analysis, we revealed three functional enolases in B. mori: BmEno1, BmEno2, and BmEnoC. BmEno1 contained a conserved key amino acid residue for metal binding and substrate binding in other species. However, BmEno2 and BmEnoC showed a change in this key amino acid. Phylogenetic analysis showed that BmEno2 and BmEnoC were distinct from BmEno1 and other enolases, and were distributed only in lepidopteran clusters. BmEno1 was expressed in all of the tissues used in our study. In contrast, BmEno2 was mainly expressed in the testis with some expression in the ovary and suboesophageal ganglion. BmEnoC was weakly expressed in the testis. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the mRNA expression of BmEno2 and BmEnoC correlated with testis development; thus, BmEno2 and BmEnoC may be related to lepidopteran-specific spermiogenesis. Conclusions: We identified and characterized three functional enolases from public databases with a combination of dry and wet bench processes in the silkworm B. mori. In addition, we determined that BmEno2 and BmEnoC had species-specific functions. Our strategy could be helpful for the detection of minor genes and functional genes in non-model organisms from public databases.

AB  - Processing of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data requires significant technical skills, involving installation, configuration, and execution of bioinformatics data pipelines, in addition to specialized postanalysis visualization and data mining software. In order to address some of these challenges, developers have leveraged virtualization containers toward seamless deployment of preconfigured bioinformatics software and pipelines on any computational platform. We present an approach for abstracting the complex data operations of multistep, bioinformatics pipelines for NGS data analysis. As examples, we have deployed 2 pipelines for RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, preconfigured within Docker virtualization containers we call Bio-Docklets. Each Bio-Docklet exposes a single data input and output endpoint and from a user perspective, running the pipelines as simply as running a single bioinformatics tool. This is achieved using a "meta-script" that automatically starts the Bio-Docklets and controls the pipeline execution through the BioBlend software library and the Galaxy Application Programming Interface. The pipeline output is postprocessed by integration with the Visual Omics Explorer framework, providing interactive data visualizations that users can access through a web browser. Our goal is to enable easy access to NGS data analysis pipelines for nonbioinformatics experts on any computing environment, whether a laboratory workstation, university computer cluster, or a cloud service provider. Beyond end users, the Bio-Docklets also enables developers to programmatically deploy and run a large number of pipeline instances for concurrent analysis of multiple datasets.

AB  - Background: De novo transcriptome assembly is an important technique for understanding gene expression in non-model organisms. Many de novo assemblers using the de Bruijn graph of a set of the RNA sequences rely on in-memory representation of this graph. However, current methods analyse the complete set of read-derived k-mer sequence at once, resulting in the need for computer hardware with large shared memory. Results: We introduce a novel approach that clusters k-mers as the first step. The clusters correspond to small sets of gene products, which can be processed quickly to give candidate transcripts. We implement the clustering step using the MapReduce approach for parallelising the analysis of large datasets, which enables the use of compute clusters. The computational task is distributed across the compute system using the industry-standard MPI protocol, and no specialised hardware is required. Using this approach, we have re-implemented the Inchworm module from the widely used Trinity pipeline, and tested the method in the context of the full Trinity pipeline. Validation tests on a range of real datasets show large reductions in the runtime and per-node memory requirements, when making use of a compute cluster. Conclusions: Our study shows that MapReduce-based clustering has great potential for distributing challenging sequencing problems, without loss of accuracy. Although we have focussed on the Trinity package, we propose that such clustering is a useful initial step for other assembly pipelines.

AB  - A major challenge in analyzing the data from high-throughput next-generation sequencing < NGS > is how to handle the huge amounts of data and variety of NGS tools and visualize the resultant outputs. To address these issues, we developed a cloud-based data analysis platform, Maser < Management and Analysis System for Enormous Reads >, and an original genome browser, Genome Explorer < GE >. Maser enables users to manage up to 2 terabytes of data to conduct analyses with easy graphical user interface operations and offers analysis pipelines in which several individual tools are combined as a single pipeline for very common and standard analyses. GE automatically visualizes genome assembly and mapping results output from Maser pipelines, without requiring additional data upload. With this function, the Maser pipelines can graphically display the results output from all the embedded tools and mapping results in a web browser. Therefore Maser realized a more user-friendly analysis platform especially for beginners by improving graphical display and providing the selected standard pipelines that work with built-in genome browser. In addition, all the analyses executed on Maser are recorded in the analysis history, helping users to trace and repeat the analyses. The entire process of analysis and its histories can be shared with collaborators or opened to the public. In conclusion, our system is useful for managing, analyzing, and visualizing NGS data and achieves traceability, reproducibility, and transparency of NGS analysis.

AB  - Genomic rearrangements that give rise to oncogenic gene fusions can offer actionable targets for cancer therapy. Here we present a systematic analysis of oncogenic gene fusions among a clinically well-characterized, prospectively collected set of 278 primary colon cancers spanning diverse tumor stages and clinical outcomes. Gene fusions and somatic genetic variations were identified in fresh frozen clinical specimens by Illumina RNA-sequencing, the STAR fusion gene detection pipeline, and GATK RNA-seq variant calling. We considered gene fusions to be pathogenically relevant when recurrent, producing divergent gene expression (outlier analysis), or as functionally important (e.g., kinase fusions). Overall, 2.5% of all specimens were defined as harboring a relevant gene fusion (kinase fusions 1.8%). Novel configurations of BRAF, NTRK3, and RET gene fusions resulting from chromosomal translocations were identified. An R-spondin fusion was found in only one tumor (0.35%), much less than an earlier reported frequency of 10% in colorectal cancers. We also found a novel fusion involving USP9X-ERAS formed by chromothripsis and leading to high expression of ERAS, a constitutively active RAS protein normally expressed only in embryonic stem cells. This USP9X-ERAS fusion appeared highly oncogenic on the basis of its ability to activate AKT signaling. Oncogenic fusions were identified only in lymph node-negative tumors that lacked BRAF or KRAS mutations. In summary, we identified several novel oncogenic gene fusions in colorectal cancer that may drive malignant development and offer new targets for personalized therapy.

AB  - Differential gene expression testing is an analysis commonly applied to RNA-Seq data. These statistical tests identify genes that are significantly different across phenotypes. We extend this testing paradigm to multivariate gene interactions from a classification perspective with the goal to detect novel gene interactions for the phenotypes of interest. This is achieved through our novel computational framework comprised of a hierarchical statistical model of the RNA-Seq processing pipeline and the corresponding optimal Bayesian classifier. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and Monte Carlo integration, we compute quantities where no analytical formulation exists. The performance is then illustrated on an expression datasetfrom a dietary intervention study where we identify gene pairs that have low classification error yet were not identified as differentially expressed. Additionally, we have released the software package to perform OBC classification on RNA-Seq data under an open source license and is available at http://bit.ly/obc_package.

AB  - Background. In recent years, next generation high throughput sequencing technologies have proven to be useful tools for investigations concerning the genomics or transcriptomics also of non-model species. Consequently, ornithologists have adopted these technologies and the respective bioinformatics tools to survey the genomes and transcriptomes of a few avian non-model species. The Common Blackbird is one of the most common bird species living in European cities, which has successfully colonized urban areas and for which no reference genonie or transcriptome is publicly available. However, to target questions like genome wide gene expression analysis, a reference genome or rranscriprome is needed. Methods. Therefore, in this study, two Common Blackbirds were sacrificed, their mRNA was isolated and analyzed by RNA-Seq to de novo assemble a transcriptome and characterize it. Illumina reads (125 bp paired-end) and a Velvet/Oases pipeline led to 162,158 transcripts. For the annotation (using Blast+), an unfiltered protein database was used. SNPs were identified using SAMtools and BCFtools. Furthermore, mRNA from three single tissues (brain, heart and liver) of the same two Common Blackbirds were sequenced by Illumina (75 bp single-end reads). The draft transcriptome and the three single tissues were compared by their BLAST hits with the package VennDiagram in R. Results. Following the annotation against protein databases, we found evidence for 15,580 genes in the transcriptome (all well characterized hits after annotation). On 18% of the assembled transcripts, 144,742 SNPs were identified which are, consequently, 0.09% of all nucleotides in the assembled transcriptome. In the transcriptome and in the singletissues(brain 10,182 shared genes were found. heart and liver), Discussion. Using a next-generation technology and bioinformatics tools, we made a first step towards the genomic investigation of the Common Blackbird. The de novo assembled transcriptome is usable for downstream analyses such as differential gene expression analysis and SNP identification. This study shows the importance of the approach to sequence single tissues to understand functions of tissues, proteins and the phenotype.

AB  - RNA-Seq technology is routinely used to characterize the transcriptome, and to detect gene expression differences among cell types, genotypes and conditions. Advances in short-read sequencing instruments such as Illumina Next-Seq have yielded easy-to-operate machines, with high throughput, at a lower price per base. However, processing this data requires bioinformatics expertise to tailor and execute specific solutions for each type of library preparation. In order to enable fast and user-friendly data analysis, we developed an intuitive and scalable transcriptome pipeline that executes the full process, starting from cDNA sequences derived by RNA-Seq [Nat Rev Genet 10:57-63, 2009] and bulk MARS-Seq [Science 343:776-779, 2014] and ending with sets of differentially expressed genes. Output files are placed in structured folders, and results summaries are provided in rich and comprehensive reports, containing dozens of plots, tables and links. Our User-friendly Transcriptome Analysis Pipeline (UTAP) is an open source, web-based intuitive platform available to the biomedical research community, enabling researchers to efficiently and accurately analyse transcriptome sequence data.

AB  - High-throughput next-generation sequencing is a powerful tool to identify the genotypic landscapes of somatic variants and therapeutic targets in various cancers including gastric cancer, forming the basis for personalized medicine in the clinical setting. Although the advent of many computational algorithms leads to higher accuracy in somatic variant calling, no standard method exists due to the limitations of each method. Here, we constructed a new pipeline. We combined two different somatic variant callers with different algorithms, Strelka and VarScan 2, and evaluated performance using whole exome sequencing data obtained from 19 Japanese cases with gastric cancer (GC); then, we characterized these tumors based on identified driver molecular alterations. More single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions were detected by Strelka and VarScan 2, respectively. SNVs detected by both tools showed higher accuracy for estimating somatic variants compared with those detected by only one of the two tools and accurately showed the mutation signature and mutations of driver genes reported for GC. Our combinatorial pipeline may have an advantage in detection of somatic mutations in GC and may be useful for further genomic characterization of Japanese patients with GC to improve the efficacy of GC treatments.

AB  - Background: A widely applied approach to extract knowledge from high-throughput genomic data is clustering of gene expression profiles followed by functional enrichment analysis. This type of analysis, when done manually, is highly subjective and has limited reproducibility. Moreover, this pipeline can be very time-consuming and resource-demanding as enrichment analysis is done for tens to hundreds of clusters at a time. Thus, the task often needs programming skills to form a pipeline of different software tools or R packages to enable an automated approach. Furthermore, visualising the results can be challenging. Results: We developed a web tool, funcExplorer, which automatically combines hierarchical clustering and enrichment analysis to detect functionally related gene clusters. The functional characterisation is achieved using structured knowledge from data sources such as Gene Ontology, KEGG and Reactome pathways, Human Protein Atlas, and Human Phenotype Ontology. funcExplorer includes various measures for finding biologically meaningful clusters, provides a modern graphical user interface, and has wide-ranging data export and sharing options as well as software transparency by open-source code. The results are presented in a visually compact and interactive format, enabling users to explore the biological essence of the data. We compared our results with previously published gene clusters to demonstrate that funcExplorer can perform the data characterisation equally well, but without requiring labour-intensive manual interference. Conclusions: The open-source web tool funcExplorer enables scientists with high-throughput genomic data to obtain a preliminary interactive overview of the expression patterns, gene names, and shared functionalities in their dataset in a visually pleasing format. funcExplorer is publicly available at https://biit.cs.ut.ee/funcexplorer

AB  - Proteogenomics, i.e. comprehensive integration of genomics and proteomics data, is a powerful approach identifying novel protein biomarkers. This is especially the case for proteins that differ structurally between disease and control conditions. As tumor development is associated with aberrant splicing, we focus on this rich source of cancer specific biomarkers. To this end, we developed a proteogenomic pipeline, Splicify, which can detect differentially expressed protein isoforms. Splicify is based on integrating RNA massive parallel sequencing data and tandem mass spectrometry proteomics data to identify protein isoforms resulting from differential splicing between two conditions. Proof of concept was obtained by applying Splicify to RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry data obtained from colorectal cancer cell line SW480, before and after siRNA-mediated downmodulation of the splicing factors SF3B1 and SRSF1. These analyses revealed 2172 and 149 differentially expressed isoforms, respectively, with peptide confirmation upon knock-down of SF3B1 and SRSF1 compared with their controls. Splice variants identified included RAC1, OSBPL3, MKI67, and SYK. One additional sample was analyzed by PacBio Iso-Seq full-length transcript sequencing after SF3B1 downmodulation. This analysis verified the alternative splicing identified by Splicify and in addition identified novel splicing events that were not represented in the human reference genome annotation. Therefore, Splicify offers a validated proteogenomic data analysis pipeline for identification of disease specific protein biomarkers resulting from mRNA alternative splicing. Splicify is publicly available on GitHub (https://github. com/NKI-TGO/SPLICIFY) and suitable to address basic research questions using pre-clinical model systems as well as translational research questions using patient-derived samples, e.g. allowing to identify clinically relevant biomarkers.

AB  - Lung cancer accounts for the highest fatalities amongst cancers worldwide. Within the frames of the Metaboli-Ca project, we explored the effects of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by utilizing next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Here, we update and expand our previous work; exploiting RNA sequencing data for the derivation of differentially expressed genes and alternatively spliced genes in cancer cells compared to the adjacent normal tissue and carry out functional analysis to discover the underlying molecular mechanisms altered in cancer cells. We used our established pipeline for quantitative analysis, which utilizes a range of state-of-the-art tools, and investigated the modifications performed in cancer cells. A significant number of 1449 genes were found as differentially expressed, while 368 genes as alternatively spliced. Focusing in alternative splicing events, a number of important molecular mechanisms emerged, such as proteasome functionality, stemness, and regulation of mitosis. Our analysis suggests several molecular players that could enhance the understanding of NSCLC pathophysiology.

AB  - Postharvest aflatoxin contamination is a challenging issue that affects peanut quality. Aflatoxin is produced by fungi belonging to the Aspergilli group, and is known as an acutely toxic, carcinogenic, and immune-suppressing class of mycotoxins. Evidence for several host genetic factors that may impact aflatoxin contamination has been reported, e.g., genes for lipoxygenase (PnLOX1 and PnLOX2/PnLOX3 that showed either positive or negative regulation with Aspergillus infection), reactive oxygen species, and WRKY (highly associated with or differentially expressed upon infection of maize with Aspergillus flavus); however, their roles remain unclear. Therefore, we conducted an RNA-sequencing experiment to differentiate gene response to the infection by A. flavus between resistant (ICG 1471) and susceptible (Florida-07) cultivated peanut genotypes. The gene expression profiling analysis was designed to reveal differentially expressed genes in response to the infection (infected vs. mock-treated seeds). In addition, the differential expression of the fungal genes was profiled. The study revealed the complexity of the interaction between the fungus and peanut seeds as the expression of a large number of genes was altered, including some in the process of plant defense to aflatoxin accumulation. Analysis of the experimental data with "keggseq," a novel designed tool for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, showed the importance of alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, spliceosome, and carbon fixation and metabolism pathways in conditioning resistance to aflatoxin accumulation. In addition, coexpression network analysis was carried out to reveal the correlation of gene expression among peanut and fungal genes. The results showed the importance of WRKY, toll/Interleukin1 receptor-nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat (TIR-NBS-LRR), ethylene, and heat shock proteins in the resistance mechanism.

AB  - Motivation: Despite considerable advancements in sequencing and computing technologies, de novo assembly of whole eukaryotic genomes is still a time-consuming task that requires a significant amount of computational resources and expertise. A targeted assembly approach to perform local assembly of sequences of interest remains a valuable option for some applications. This is especially true for gene-centric assemblies, whose resulting sequence can be readily utilized for more focused biological research. Here we describe Kollector, an alignment-free targeted assembly pipeline that uses thousands of transcript sequences concurrently to inform the localized assembly of corresponding gene loci. Kollector robustly reconstructs introns and novel sequences within these loci, and scales well to large genomes-properties that makes it especially useful for researchers working on non-model eukaryotic organisms. Results: We demonstrate the performance of Kollector for assembling complete or near-complete Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens gene loci from their respective, input transcripts. In a time-and memory-efficient manner, the Kollector pipeline successfully reconstructs respectively 99% and 80% (compared to 86% and 73% with standard de novo assembly techniques) of C.elegans and H.sapiens transcript targets in their corresponding genomic space using whole genome shotgun sequencing reads. We also show that Kollector outperforms both established and recently released targeted assembly tools. Finally, we demonstrate three use cases for Kollector, including comparative and cancer genomics applications.

AB  - Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) is an important agronomic crop and a major model fruit-producing plant. To facilitate basic and applied research, comprehensive experimental resources and omics information on tomato are available following their development. Mutant lines and cDNA clones from a dwarf cultivar, Micro-Tom, are two of these genetic resources. Large-scale sequencing data for ESTs and full-length cDNAs from Micro-Tom continue to be gathered. In conjunction with information on the reference genome sequence of another cultivar, Heinz 1706, the Micro-Tom experimental resources have facilitated comprehensive functional analyses. To enhance the efficiency of acquiring omics information for tomato biology, we have integrated the information on the Micro-Tom experimental resources and the Heinz 1706 genome sequence. We have also inferred gene structure by comparison of sequences between the genome of Heinz 1706 and the transcriptome, which are comprised of Micro-Tom full-length cDNAs and Heinz 1706 RNA-seq data stored in the KaFTom and Sequence Read Archive databases. In order to provide large-scale omics information with streamlined connectivity we have developed and maintain a web database TOMATOMICS (http://bioinf.mind.meiji.ac.jp/tomatomics/). In TOMATOMICS, access to the information on the cDNA clone resources, full-length mRNA sequences, gene structures, expression profiles and functional annotations of genes is available through search functions and the genome browser, which has an intuitive graphical interface.

AB  - The introduction of new high-throughput small RNA sequencing protocols that generate large-scale genomics datasets along with increasing evidence of the significant regulatory roles of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have highlighted the urgent need for tools to analyze and interpret large amounts of small RNA sequencing data. However, it remains challenging to systematically and comprehensively discover and characterize sncRNA genes and specifically-processed sncRNA products from these datasets. To fill this gap, we present Small RNA-seq Portal for Analysis of sequencing expeRiments (SPAR), a user-friendly web server for interactive processing, analysis, annotation and visualization of small RNA sequencing data. SPAR supports sequencing data generated from various experimental protocols, including smRNA-seq, short total RNA sequencing, microRNA-seq, and single-cell small RNA-seq. Additionally, SPAR includes publicly available reference sncRNA datasets from our DASHR database and from ENCODE across 185 human tissues and cell types to produce highly informative small RNA annotations across all major small RNA types and other features such as co-localization with various genomic features, precursor transcript cleavage patterns, and conservation. SPAR allows the user to compare the input experiment against reference ENCODE/DASHR datasets. SPAR currently supports analyses of human (hg19, hg38) andmouse (mm10) sequencing data. SPAR is freely available at https://www.lisanwanglab.org/SPAR.

AB  - The use of gene panel sequence for diagnostic and prognostic testing is now widespread, but there are so far few objective tests of methods to interpret these data. We describe the design and implementation of a gene panel sequencing data analysis pipeline (VarP) and its assessment in a CAGI4 community experiment. The method was applied to clinical gene panel sequencing data of 106 patients, with the goal of determining which of 14 disease classes each patient has and the corresponding causative variant(s). The disease class was correctly identified for 36 cases, including 10 where the original clinical pipeline did not find causative variants. For a further seven cases, we found strong evidence of an alternative disease to that tested. Many of the potentially causative variants are missense, with no previous association with disease, and these proved the hardest to correctly assign pathogenicity or otherwise. Post analysis showed that three-dimensional structure data could have helped for up to half of these cases. Over-reliance on HGMD annotation led to a number of incorrect disease assignments. We used a largely ad hoc method to assign probabilities of pathogenicity for each variant, and there is much work still to be done in this area.

AB  - Background: Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic sequences that randomly propagate within their host's genome. This mobility has the potential to affect gene transcription and cause disease. However, TEs are technically challenging to identify, which complicates efforts to assess the impact of TE insertions on disease. Here we present a targeted sequencing protocol and computational pipeline to identify polymorphic and novel TE insertions using next-generation sequencing: TE-NGS. The method simultaneously targets the three subfamilies that are responsible for the majority of recent TE activity (L1HS, AluYa5/8, and AluYb8/9) thereby obviating the need for multiple experiments and reducing the amount of input material required. Results: Here we describe the laboratory protocol and detection algorithm, and a benchmark experiment for the reference genome NA12878. We demonstrate a substantial enrichment for on-target fragments, and high sensitivity and precision to both reference and NA12878-specific insertions. We report 17 previously unreported loci for this individual which are supported by orthogonal long-read evidence, and we identify 1470 polymorphic and novel TEs in 12 additional samples that were previously undocumented in databases of insertion polymorphisms. Conclusions: We anticipate that future applications of TE-NGS alongside exome sequencing of patients with sporadic disease will reduce the number of unresolved cases, and improve estimates of the contribution of TEs to human genetic disease.

AB  - Background and Objective: Docker is a light containerization program that shows almost the same performance as a local environment. Recently, many bioinformatics tools have been distributed as Docker images that include complex settings such as libraries, configurations, and data if needed, as well as the actual tools. Users can simply download and run them without making the effort to compile and configure them, and can obtain reproducible results. In spite of these advantages, several problems remain. First, there is a lack of clear standards for distribution of Docker images, and the Docker Hub often provides multiple images with the same objective but different uses. For these reasons, it can be difficult for users to learn how to select and use them. Second, Docker images are often not suitable as a component of a pipeline, because many of them include big data. Moreover, a group of users can have difficulties when sharing a pipeline composed of Docker images. Users of a group may modify scripts or use different versions of the data, which causes inconsistent results. Methods and Results: To handle the problems described above, we developed a Java web application, DockerBIO, which provides reliable, verified, light-weight Docker images for various bioinformatics tools and for various kinds of reference data. With DockerBIO, users can easily build a pipeline with tools and data registered at DockerBIO, and if necessary, users can easily register new tools or data. Built pipelines are registered in DockerBIO, which provides an efficient running environment for the pipelines registered at DockerBIO. This enables user groups to run their pipelines without expending much effort to copy and modify them.

AB  - Background: With the rapid advancement of array-based genotyping techniques, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with common complex diseases. However, it has been shown that only a small proportion of the genetic etiology of complex diseases could be explained by the genetic factors identified from GWAS. This missing heritability could possibly be explained by gene-gene interaction (epistasis) and rare variants. There has been an exponential growth of gene-gene interaction analysis for common variants in terms of methodological developments and practical applications. Also, the recent advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies makes it possible to conduct rare variant analysis. However, little progress has been made in gene-gene interaction analysis for rare variants. Results: Here, we propose GxGrare which is a new gene-gene interaction method for the rare variants in the framework of the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis. The proposed method consists of three steps; 1) collapsing the rare variants, 2) MDR analysis for the collapsed rare variants, and 3) detect top candidate interaction pairs. GxGrare can be used for the detection of not only gene-gene interactions, but also interactions within a single gene. The proposed method is illustrated with 1080 whole exome sequencing data of the Korean population in order to identify causal gene-gene interaction for rare variants for type 2 diabetes. Conclusion: The proposed GxGrare performs well for gene-gene interaction detection with collapsing of rare variants. GxGrare is available at http://bibs.snu.ac.kr/software/gxgrare which contains simulation data and documentation. Supported operating systems include Linux and OS X.

AB  - aSummary: Advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing have enabled more efficient detection of fusion transcripts, but the technology and associated software used for fusion detection from sequencing data often yield a high false discovery rate. Good prioritization of the results is important, and this can be helped by a visualization framework that automatically integrates RNA data with known genomic features. Here we present chimeraviz, a Bioconductor package that automates the creation of chimeric RNA visualizations. The package supports input from nine different fusion-finder tools: deFuse, EricScript, InFusion, JAFFA, FusionCatcher, FusionMap, PRADA, SOAPfuse and STAR-FUSION. Availability and implementation: chimeraviz is an R package available via Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/chimeraviz.html) under Artistic-2.0. Source code and support is available at GitHub (https://github.com/stianlagstad/chimeraviz).

AB  - With advances in molecular biology, various biological phenomena can now be explored at higher resolution using mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), two powerful high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. While methods are used widely in mouse, human, etc., less information is available in other animals, such as the chicken. Here we assemble a workflow of the RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analyses for the chicken studies using chicken skin appendage tissue as an example. We present guidelines for RNA-Seq quality control, alignment, quantification, normalization, and differentially expressed gene analysis. In the meantime, we outline a bioinformatics pipeline for ChIP-Seq quality control, alignment, peak calling, super-enhancer identification, and differential enrichment analysis.

AB  - Biotechnology revolution generates a plethora of omics data with an exponential growth pace. Therefore, biological data mining demands automatic, 'high quality' curation efforts to organize biomedical knowledge into online databases. BioDataome is a database of uniformly preprocessed and disease-annotated omics data with the aim to promote and accelerate the reuse of public data. We followed the same preprocessing pipeline for each biological mart (microarray gene expression, RNA-Seq gene expression and DNA methylation) to produce ready for downstream analysis datasets and automatically annotated them with disease-ontology terms. We also designate datasets that share common samples and automatically discover control samples in case-control studies. Currently, BioDataome includes similar to 5600 datasets, similar to 260 000 samples spanning similar to 500 diseases and can be easily used in large-scale massive experiments and meta-analysis. All datasets are publicly available for querying and downloading via BioDataome web application. We demonstrate BioDataome's utility by presenting exploratory data analysis examples. We have also developed BioDataome R package found in: https://github.com/mensxmachina/BioDataome/.

AB  - Read alignment is the first step in most sequencing data analyses. Because a read's point of origin can be ambiguous, aligners report a mapping quality, which is the probability that the reported alignment is incorrect. Despite its importance, there is no established and general method for calculating mapping quality. I describe a framework for predicting mapping qualities that works by simulating a set of tandem reads. These are like the input reads in important ways, but the true point of origin is known. I implement this method in an accurate and low-overhead tool called Qtip, which is compatible with popular aligners.

AB  - The authors describe a method for real-time monitoring of the activity of ribonuclease H (RNase H). It is based on target-triggered rolling circle amplification (RCA). It utilizes a specially designed primer that contains a RNA sequence in the center and an amino group at the 3'-end. In the absence of RNase H, the primer when hybridized to a circular DNA template is not extended by DNA polymerase due to the amino group at the 3'-end. In contrast, the presence of RNase H specifically degrades the RNA sequence of the primer hybridized to the circular DNA template. This results in the conversion of the 3'-amino group to a 3'-hydroxy group and thereby enables the extension reaction promoted by DNA polymerase. This, consequently, leads to efficient RCA producing a long concatenated DNA strand. Its generation can be monitored in real-time by using the fluorescent dye SYBR green II which is specific for single-stranded DNA. Based on this RNase H-triggered RCA, RNase H activity can be selectively determined at levels as low as 0.019 U.mL(-1) with a total assay time of <5 min. The diagnostic capability of this assay was demonstrated by monitoring the activity of RNase H in tumor cells.

AB  - One of the problems of de novo assembly is the occurrence of artifactual direct or inverted repeats that are mainly formed by misassembly of short sequencing reads and cannot be differentiated from real sequence repeats. In this study, we compared the frequency of artifactual repeats generated by four de novo assembly pipelines: (1) Velvet-Oases-The Gene Index Clustering Tool (TGICL), (2) Velvet-TGICL, (3) Trinity-TGICL and (4) SOAPdenovo-Trans-TGICL by analysing the RNA-Seq data of Gracilaria changii. The overall completeness of these four de novo assemblies were in the range of 85.2-90.0% for complete Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs), with the Velvet-TGICL assembly having the highest percentage of single copy and complete BUSCOs (78.9%). When Velvet-Oases-TGICL was used, a total of 2510 (8.44%) direct and 1967 (6.61%) inverted artifactual repeats were found among the assembled sequences. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of 15 unigenes containing direct or inverted repeats confirmed that the repeats were due to assembly artifacts. When Oases was omitted from the assembly pipeline (i.e. Vetvet-TGICL), the number of unigenes containing artifactual direct and inverted repeats reduced significantly to 238 (1.63%) and 8 (0.06%), respectively. Among the four de novo assemblies, the Velvet-Oases-TGICL and Velvet-TGICL assemblies had the highest and the lower percentage of unigene containing artifactual repeats, respectively. The occurrence of artifactual repeats in the transcriptome data may complicate downstream analyses such as identification of splice variants and gene fusion, but the differential gene expression was less affected by the presence of artifactual repeats in this study. The information provided in this paper (based on a non-model seaweed G. changii) could be useful for designing and optimizing assembly pipeline for future analysis of RNA-Seq data from organisms without a reference genome.

AB  - Rare inherited bleeding disorders (IBD) are a common cause of bleeding tendency. To ensure a correct diagnosis, specialized laboratory analyses are necessary. This study reports the results of an upfront diagnostic strategy using targeted whole exome sequencing. In total, 156 patients with a significant bleeding assessment tool score participated in the study, of which a third had thrombocytopenia. Eighty-seven genes specifically associated with genetic predisposition to bleeding were analysed by whole exome sequencing. Variants were classified according to the five-tier scheme. We identified 353 germline variants. Eight patients (5%) harboured a known pathogenic variant. Of the 345 previously unknown variants, computational analyses predicted 99 to be significant. Further filtration according to the Mendelian inheritance pattern, resulted in 59 variants being predicted to be clinically significant. Moreover, 34% (20/59) were assigned as novel class 4 or 5 variants upon targeted functional testing. A class 4 or 5 variant was identified in 30% of patients with thrombocytopenia (14/47) versus 11% of patients with a normal platelet count (12/109) (P<0.01). An IBD diagnosis has a major clinical impact. The genetic investigations detailed here extricated our patients from a diagnostic conundrum, thus demonstrating that continuous optimization of the diagnostic work-up of IBD is of great benefit.

AB  - Unintended off-target mutations induced by CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases may result in unwanted consequences, which will impede the efficient applicability of this technology for genetic improvement. We have recently edited the goat genome through CRISPR/Cas9 by targeting MSTN and FGF5, which increased muscle fiber diameter and hair fiber length, respectively. Using family trio-based sequencing that allow better discrimination of variant origins, we herein generated offspring from edited goats, and sequenced the members of four family trios (gene-edited goats and their offspring) to an average of similar to 36.8x coverage. This data was to systematically examined for mutation profiles using a stringent pipeline that comprehensively analyzed the sequence data for de novo single nucleotide variants, indels, and structural variants from the genome. Our results revealed that the incidence of de novo mutations in the offspring was equivalent to normal populations. We further conducted RNA sequencing using muscle and skin tissues from the offspring and control animals, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were related to muscle fiber development in muscles, skin development, and immune responses in skin tissues. Furthermore, in contrast to recently reports of Cas9 triggered p53 expression alterations in cultured cells, we provide primary evidence to show that Cas9-mediated genetic modification does not induce apparent p53 expression changes in animal tissues. This work provides adequate molecular evidence to support the reliability of conducting Cas9-mediated genome editing in large animal models for biomedicine and agriculture.

AB  - DNA methylation is a crucial regulator of gene transcription in the etiology and pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, it is reasonable to identify DNA methylation-related prognostic markers. Currently, we aimed to make an integrative epigenetic analysis of HCC to identify the effectiveness of epigenetic drivers in predicting prognosis for HCC patients. By the software pipeline TCGA-Assembler 2, RNA-seq, and methylation data were downloaded and processed from The Cancer Genome Atlas. A bioconductor package MethylMix was utilized to incorporate gene expression and methylation data on all 363 samples and identify 589 epigenetic drivers with transcriptionally predictive. By univariate survival analysis, 72 epigenetic drivers correlated with overall survival (OS) were selected for further analysis in our training cohort. By the robust likelihood-based survival model, six epi-drivers (doublecortin domain containing 2, flavin containing monooxygenase 3, G protein-coupled receptor 171, Lck interacting transmembrane adaptor 1, S100 calcium binding protein P, small nucleolar RNA host gene 6) serving as prognostic markers was identified and then a DNA methylation signature for HCC (MSH) predicting OS was identified to stratify patients into low-risk and high-risk groups in the training cohort (p<0.001). The capability of MSH was also assessed in the validation cohort (p=0.002). Furthermore, a receiver operating characteristic curve confirmed MSH as an effective prognostic model for predicting OS in HCC patients in training area under curve (AUC=0.802) and validation (AUC=0.691) cohorts. Finally, a nomogram comprising MSH and pathologic stage was generated to predict OS in the training cohort, and it also operated effectively in the validation cohort (concordance index: 0.674). In conclusion, MSH, a six epi-drivers based signature, is a potential model to predict prognosis for HCC patients.

AB  - Background: Researches on immunotherapy of glioma has been increasing exponentially in recent years. However, autoimmune-like side effects of current immune checkpoint blockade hindered the clinical application of immunotherapy in glioma. The discovery of the TIM-3, a tumor-specific immune checkpoint, has shed a new light on solution of this dilemma. We aimed at investigating the role of TIM-3 at transcriptome level and its relationship with clinical practice in glioma. Methods: A cohort of 325 glioma patients with RNA-seq data from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA project) was analyzed, and the results were well validated in TCGA RNA-seq data of 699 gliomas. R language was used as the main tool for statistical analysis and graphical work. Results: TIM-3 was enriched in glioblastoma (the most malignant glioma) and IDH-wildtype glioma. TIM-3 can act as a potential marker for mesenchymal molecular subtype according to TCGA transcriptional classification scheme in glioma. TIM-3 was closely related to immune functions in glioma, especially T cell mediated immune response to tumor cell and T cell mediated cytotoxicity directed against tumor cell target. Moreover, TIM-3 and PD-L1 played almost exactly the same inflammatory activation functions in glioma. Clinically, high expression of TIM-3 was an independent indicator of poor prognosis. Conclusion: The expression of TIM-3 is closely related to the pathology and molecular pathology of glioma. Meanwhile, in glioma TIM-3 plays a specific role in T cell tumor immune response. Therefore, TIM- 3 is a promising target for immunotherapeutic strategies, providing an alternative treatment when glioma gains resistance to antibodies of PD-1/PD-L1.

AB  - Background: Curds are the main edible organs, which exhibit remarkable yield heterosis in F-1 hybrid broccoli. However, the molecular basis underlying heterosis in broccoli remains elusive. Results: In the present study, transcriptome profiles revealed that the hybridization made most genes show additive expression patterns in hybrid broccoli. The differentially expressed genes including the non-additively expressed genes detected in the hybrid broccoli and its parents were mainly involved in light, hormone and hydrogen peroxide-mediated signaling pathways, responses to stresses, and regulation of floral development, which suggested that these biological processes should play crucial roles in the yield heterosis of broccoli. Among them, light and hydrogen peroxide-mediated signaling pathways represent two novel classes of regulatory processes that could function in yield or biomass heterosis of plants. Totally, 53 candidate genes closely involved in curd yield heterosis were identified. Methylome data indicated that the DNA methylation ratio of the hybrids was higher than that of their parents. However, the DNA methylation levels of most sites also displayed additive expression patterns. These sites with differential methylation levels were predominant in the intergenic regions. In most cases, the changes of DNA methylation levels in gene regions did not significantly affect their expression levels. Conclusions: The differentially expressed genes, the regulatory processes and the possible roles of DNA methylation modification in the formation of curd yield heterotic trait were discovered. These findings provided comprehensive insights into the curd yield heterosis in broccoli, and were significant for breeding high-yield broccoli varieties.

AB  - Multi-qubit quantum Rabi model, which is a fundamental model describing light-matter interaction, plays an important role in various physical systems. In this paper, we propose a theoretical method to simulate multi-qubit quantum Rabi model in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system. By means of external transversal and longitudinal driving fields, an effective Hamiltonian describing the multi-qubit quantum Rabi model is derived. The effective frequency of the resonator and the effective splitting of the qubits depend on the external driving fields. By adjusting the frequencies and the amplitudes of the driving fields, the stronger coupling regimes could be reached. The numerical simulation shows that our proposal works well in a wide range of parameter space. Moreover, our scheme can be utilized to generate two-qubit gate, Schrodinger states, and multi-qubit GHZ states. The maximum displacement of the Schrodinger cat states can be enhanced by increasing the number of the qubits and the relative coupling strength. It should be mention that we can obtain high fidelity Schrodinger cat states and multi-qubit GHZ states even the system suffering dissipation. The presented proposal may open a way to study the stronger coupling regimes whose coupling strength is far away from ultrastrong coupling regimes.

AB  - Astragalus membranaceus, also known as Huangqi in China, is one of the most widely used medicinal herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Traditional Chinese Medicine formulations from Astragalus membranaceus have been used to treat a wide range of illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, nephritis and cancers. Pharmacological studies have shown that immunomodulating, anti-hyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiviral activities exist in the extract of Astragalus membranaceus. Therefore, characterising the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in Astragalus membranaceus, such as Astragalosides, Calycosin and Calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside, is of particular importance for further genetic studies of Astragalus membranaceus. In this study, we reconstructed the Astragalus membranaceus full-length transcriptomes from leaf and root tissues using PacBio Iso-Seq long reads. We identified 27 975 and 22 343 full-length unique transcript models in each tissue respectively. Compared with previous studies that used short read sequencing, our reconstructed transcripts are longer, and are more likely to be full-length and include numerous transcript variants. Moreover, we also re-characterised and identified potential transcript variants of genes involved in Astragalosides, Calycosin and Calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside biosynthesis. In conclusion, our study provides a practical pipeline to characterise the full-length transcriptome for species without a reference genome and a useful genomic resource for exploring the biosynthesis of active compounds in Astragalus membranaceus.

AB  - RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) function in all aspects of RNA processes including stability, structure, export, localization and translation, and control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. To investigate the roles of RBPs and their direct RNA ligands in vivo, recent global approaches combining RNA immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (RIP-seq) as well as UV-cross-linking (CLIP-seq) have become instrumental in dissecting RNA-protein interactions. However, the computational analysis of these high-throughput sequencing data is still challenging. Here, we provide a computational pipeline to analyze CLIP-seq and RIP-seq datasets. This generic analytic procedure may help accelerate the identification of direct RNA-protein interactions from high-throughput RBP profiling experiments in a variety of bacterial species.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are pervasively expressed circles of non-coding RNAs. Even though many circRNAs have been reported in humans, their expression patterns and functions remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed a pipeline named RAISE to detect circRNAs in RNA-seq data. RAISE can fully characterize circRNA structure and abundance. We evaluated inter-individual variations in circRNA expression in humans by applying this pipeline to numerous non-poly(A)-selected RNA-seq data. We identified 59,128 circRNA candidates in 61 human liver samples, with almost no overlap in the circRNA of the recruited samples. Approximately 89% of the circRNAs were detected in one or two samples. In comparison, 10% of the linear mRNAs and non-coding RNAs were detected in each sample. We estimated the variation in other tissues, especially the circRNA high-abundance tissues, in advance. Only 0.5% of the 50,631 brain circRNA candidates were shared among the 30 recruited brain samples, which is similar to the proportion in liver. Moreover, we found inter-and intra-individual diversity in circRNAs expression in the granulocyte RNA-seq data from seven individuals sampled 3 times at one-month intervals. Our findings suggest that careful consideration of inter-individual diversity is required when extensively identifying human circRNAs or proposing their use as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in disease.

AB  - Motivation: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that are widely expressed in various cell lines and tissues of many organisms. Although the exact function of many circRNAs is largely unknown, the cell type-and tissue-specific circRNA expression has implicated their crucial functions in many biological processes. Hence, the quantification of circRNA expression from high-throughput RNA-seq data is becoming important to ascertain. Although many model-based methods have been developed to quantify linear RNA expression from RNA-seq data, these methods are not applicable to circRNA quantification. Results: Here, we proposed a novel strategy that transforms circular transcripts to pseudo-linear transcripts and estimates the expression values of both circular and linear transcripts using an existing model-based algorithm, Sailfish. The new strategy can accurately estimate transcript expression of both linear and circular transcripts from RNA-seq data. Several factors, such as gene length, amount of expression and the ratio of circular to linear transcripts, had impacts on quantification performance of circular transcripts. In comparison to count-based tools, the new computational framework had superior performance in estimating the amount of circRNA expression from both simulated and real ribosomal RNA-depleted (rRNA-depleted) RNA-seq datasets. On the other hand, the consideration of circular transcripts in expression quantification from rRNA-depleted RNA-seq data showed substantial increased accuracy of linear transcript expression. Our proposed strategy was implemented in a program named Sailfish-cir.

AB  - Mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) carries not only well-conserved protein coding, tRNA and rRNA genes, but also highly variable non-coding regions (NCRs). However, the NCRs show poor conservation across species, making their function and evolution elusive. Identification and functional characterization of NCRs across species would be critical for addressing these questions. To this end, we devised a computational pipeline and performed de novo assembly and annotation of mtDNA from 19 Caenorhabditis species using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The mtDNAs for 14 out of the 19 species are reported for the first time. Comparison of the 19 genomes reveals species-specific sampling of partial displacement-loop (D-loop) sequence as a novel NCR inserted into a unique tRNA cluster, suggesting an important role of the D-loop and the tRNA cluster in shaping NCR evolution. Intriguingly, RNA-Seq analysis suggests that a novel NCR resulting from a recent duplication of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) could be utilized as a 30' UTR for up-regulation of its upstream gene. The expression analysis shows a species-and sex-specific expression of mitochondrial genes encoded by mtDNA and nucleus, respectively. Our analyses provide important insights into the function and evolution of mitochondrial NCRs and pave the way for further studying the function and evolution of mitochondrial genome.

AB  - Background: With the development of rapid and inexpensive DNA sequencing, the genome sequences of more than 100 fungal species have been made available. This dataset provides an excellent resource for comparative genomics analyses, which can be used to discover genetic elements, including noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Bioinformatics tools similar to those used to uncover novel ncRNAs in bacteria, likewise, should be useful for searching fungal genomic sequences, and the relative ease of genetic experiments with some model fungal species could facilitate experimental validation studies. Results: We have adapted a bioinformatics pipeline for discovering bacterial ncRNAs to systematically analyze many fungal genomes. This comparative genomics pipeline integrates information on conserved RNA sequence and structural features with alternative splicing information to reveal fungal RNA motifs that are candidate regulatory domains, or that might have other possible functions. A total of 15 prominent classes of structured ncRNA candidates were identified, including variant HDV self-cleaving ribozyme representatives, atypical snoRNA candidates, and possible structured antisense RNA motifs. Candidate regulatory motifs were also found associated with genes for ribosomal proteins, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SDC), amidase, and HexA protein involved in Woronin body formation. We experimentally confirm that the variant HDV ribozymes undergo rapid self-cleavage, and we demonstrate that the SDC RNA motif reduces the expression of SAM decarboxylase by translational repression. Furthermore, we provide evidence that several other motifs discovered in this study are likely to be functional ncRNA elements. Conclusions: Systematic screening of fungal genomes using a computational discovery pipeline has revealed the existence of a variety of novel structured ncRNAs. Genome contexts and similarities to known ncRNA motifs provide strong evidence for the biological and biochemical functions of some newly found ncRNA motifs. Although initial examinations of several motifs provide evidence for their likely functions, other motifs will require more in-depth analysis to reveal their functions.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is increasing in incidence and resistance to treatment worldwide. The challenges in limited therapeutic options and poor survival outcomes in BC subtypes persist because of its molecular heterogeneity and resistance to standard endocrine therapy. Recently, high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been used to identify biomarkers of disease progression and signaling pathways that could be amenable to specific therapies according to the BC subtype. However, there is no single generally accepted pipeline for the analysis of RNA-seq data in biomarker discovery due, in part, to the needs of simultaneously satisfying constraints of sensitivity and specificity. We proposed a combined approach using gene-wise normalization, UQ-pgQ2, followed by a Wald test from DESeq2. Our approach improved the analysis based on within-group comparisons in terms of the specificity when applied to publicly available RNA-seq BC datasets. In terms of identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we combined an optimized log(2) fold change cutoff with a nominal false discovery rate of 0.05 to further minimize false positives. Using this method in the analysis of two GEO BC datasets, we identified 797 DEGs uniquely expressed in triple negative BC (TNBC) and significantly associated with T cell and immune-related signaling, contributing to the immunotherapeutic efficacy in TNBC patients. In contrast, we identified 1403 DEGs uniquely expressed in estrogen positive and HER2 negative BC (ER(+)HER2(-) BC) and significantly associated with eicosanoid, notching and FAK signaling while a common set of genes was associated with cellular growth and proliferation. Thus, our approach to control for false positives identified two distinct gene expression profiles associated with these two subtypes of BC which are distinguishable by their molecular and functional attributes.

AB  - The long noncoding RNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) has been shown to regulate multiple cancer-related cellular activities including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. In this study, we confirm that repression of NEAT1 induces DNA damage, disturbs the cell cycle, and arrests the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. By taking advantage of the prostate cancer tumor transcriptome profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas, our data-mining pipeline identified a series of transcription factors (TF) whose regulatory activities on target genes depended on the level of NEAT1. Among them was putative TF CDC5L, which bound directly to NEAT1. Silencing NEAT1 in prostate cancer cells repressed the transcriptional activity of CDC5L, and RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses further revealed a handful of potential targets of CDC5L regulated by NEAT1 expression. One target of CDC5L, ARGN, mediated the strong phenotypic consequences of NEAT1 reduction, including DNA damage, cell-cycle dysregulation, and proliferation arrest. In summary, we have established the requirement of the CDC5L-AGRN circuit for the essential oncogenic role of NEAT1 in prostate cancer cells. Significance: An integrative methodology uncovers CDC5L-AGRN signaling as critical to the tumor-promoting function of long noncoding RNA NEAT1 in prostate cancer cells. (C) 2018 AACR.

AB  - BackgroundTesting the dependence of two variables is one of the fundamental tasks in statistics. In this work, we developed an open-source R package (knnAUC) for detecting nonlinear dependence between one continuous variable X and one binary dependent variables Y (0 or 1).ResultsWe addressed this problem by using knnAUC (k-nearest neighbors AUC test, the R package is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/knnauc/). In the knnAUC software framework, we first resampled a dataset to get the training and testing dataset according to the sample ratio (from 0 to 1), and then constructed a k-nearest neighbors algorithm classifier to get the yhat estimator (the probability of y=1) of testy (the true label of testing dataset). Finally, we calculated the AUC (area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic) estimator and tested whether the AUC estimator is greater than 0.5. To evaluate the advantages of knnAUC compared to seven other popular methods, we performed extensive simulations to explore the relationships between eight different methods and compared the false positive rates and statistical power using both simulated and real datasets (Chronic hepatitis B datasets and kidney cancer RNA-seq datasets).ConclusionsWe concluded that knnAUC is an efficient R package to test non-linear dependence between one continuous variable and one binary dependent variable especially in computational biology area.

AB  - The genome of the wild diploid strawberry species Fragaria vesca, an ideal model system of cultivated strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa, octoploid) and other Rosaceae family crops, was first published in 2011 and followed by a new assembly (Fvb). However, the annotation for Fvb mainly relied on ab initio predictions and included only predicted coding sequences, therefore an improved annotation is highly desirable. Here, a new annotation version named v2.0.a2 was created for the Fvb genome by a pipeline utilizing one PacBio library, 90 Illumina RNA-seq libraries, and 9 small RNA-seq libraries. Altogether, 18,641 genes (55.6% out of 33,538 genes) were augmented with information on the 50 and/or 30 UTRs, 13,168 (39.3%) protein-coding genes were modified or newly identified, and 7,370 genes were found to possess alternative isoforms. In addition, 1,938 long non-coding RNAs, 171 miRNAs, and 51,714 small RNA clusters were integrated into the annotation. This new annotation of F. vesca is substantially improved in both accuracy and integrity of gene predictions, beneficial to the gene functional studies in strawberry and to the comparative genomic analysis of other horticultural crops in Rosaceae family.

AB  - Background: The rapid development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has continuously been refreshing the throughput of sequencing data. However, due to the lack of a smart tool that is both fast and accurate, the analysis task for NGS data, especially those with low coverage, remains challenging. Results: We proposed a decision-tree based variant calling algorithm. Experiments on a set of real data indicate that our algorithm achieves high accuracy and sensitivity for SNVs and indels and shows good adaptability on low-coverage data. In particular, our algorithm is obviously faster than 3 widely used tools in our experiments. Conclusions: We implemented our algorithm in a software named Fuwa and applied it together with 4 well-known variant callers, i.e., Platypus, GATK-UnifiedGenotyper, GATK-HaplotypeCaller and SAMtools, to three sequencing data sets of a well-studied sample NA12878, which were produced by whole-genome, whole-exome and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing technology respectively. We also conducted additional experiments on the WGS data of 4 newly released samples that have not been used to populate dbSNP.

AB  - PurposeChildren with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) whose disease is refractory to standard induction chemotherapy therapy or who experience relapse after initial response have dismal outcomes. We sought to comprehensively profile pediatric AML microRNA (miRNA) samples to identify dysregulated genes and assess the utility of miRNAs for improved outcome prediction.Patients and MethodsTo identify miRNA biomarkers that are associated with treatment failure, we performed a comprehensive sequence-based characterization of the pediatric AML miRNA landscape. miRNA sequencing was performed on 1,362 samples1,303 primary, 22 refractory, and 37 relapse samples. One hundred sixty-four matched samples127 primary and 37 relapse sampleswere analyzed by using RNA sequencing.ResultsBy using penalized lasso Cox proportional hazards regression, we identified 36 miRNAs the expression levels at diagnosis of which were highly associated with event-free survival. Combined expression of the 36 miRNAs was used to create a novel miRNA-based risk classification scheme (AMLmiR36). This new miRNA-based risk classifier identifies those patients who are at high risk (hazard ratio, 2.830; P .001) or low risk (hazard ratio, 0.323; P .001) of experiencing treatment failure, independent of conventional karyotype or mutation status. The performance of AMLmiR36 was independently assessed by using 878 patients from two different clinical trials (AAML0531 and AAML1031). Our analysis also revealed that miR-106a-363 was abundantly expressed in relapse and refractory samples, and several candidate targets of miR-106a-5p were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, a process that is suppressed in treatment-resistant leukemic cells.ConclusionTo assess the utility of miRNAs for outcome prediction in patients with pediatric AML, we designed and validated a miRNA-based risk classification scheme. We also hypothesized that the abundant expression of miR-106a could increase treatment resistance via modulation of genes that are involved in oxidative phosphorylation.

AB  - The post-transcriptional modification of RNA by the addition of one or more chemical groups has been known for over 50 years. These chemical modifications, once thought to be static, are now being discovered to play key regulatory roles in gene expression. The advent of massive parallel sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) now allows us to probe the complexity of cellular RNA and how chemically altering RNA structure expands the RNA vocabulary. Here we present an overview of the various strategies and technologies that are available to profile RNA chemical modifications at the cellular level. These strategies can be characterized as targeted and untargeted approaches: targeted strategies are developed for one single chemical modification while untargeted strategies are more broadly applicable to a range of such chemical changes. Key for all of these approaches is the ability to locate modifications within the RNA sequence. While most of these methods are built upon an RNA-Seq pipeline, alternative approaches based on mass spectrometry or conventional DNA sequencing retain value in the overall analysis process. We also look forward toward future opportunities and technologies that may expand the types of modifications that can be globally profiled. Given the ever increasing recognition that these RNA chemical modifications play important biological roles, a variety of methods, preferably orthogonal approaches, will be required to globally identify, validate and quantify RNA chemical modifications found in the transcriptome.

AB  - Aims Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous disease characterised by genetically complex abnormalities. The classical mutational spectrum includes recurrent chromosomal aberrations and gene-level mutations. Recurrent translocations involving the IGH gene such as t(11;14), t(4;14) and t(14;16) are well known. However, the presence of complex genetic abnormalities raises the possibility that fusions other than the recurrent IGH translocations exist. We therefore employed a targeted RNA-sequencing panel to identify novel putative fusions in a local cohort of MM. Methods Targeted RNA-sequencing was performed on 21 patient samples using the Illumina TruSight RNA Pan-Cancer Panel (comprising 1385 genes). Fusion calls were generated from the Illumina RNA-Sequencing Alignment software (V.1.0.0). These samples had conventional cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridisation data for the common recurrent chromosomal abnormalities (t(11;14), t(4;14), t(14;16) and 17p13 deletion). The MMRF CoMMpass dataset was analysed using the TopHat-fusion pipeline. Results A total of 10 novel fusions were identified by the TruSight RNA Pan-Cancer Panel. Two of these fusions, HGFICACNA2D1 and SMC31MX11, were validated by reverse transcription PCR and Sanger sequencing as they involve genes that may have biological relevance in MM genesis. Four of these (MAP2K41MAP2K4P1) are likely to be spurious secondary to misalignment of reads to a pseudogene. One record of the HGF/CACNA2D1 fusion was identified from the MMRF CoMMpass dataset. Conclusions The identification of novel fusions offers insights into the biology of MM and might have clinical relevance. Further functional studies are required to determine the biological and clinical relevance of these novel fusions.

AB  - Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a class of noncoding RNA > 200 bp in length that has essential roles in regulating a variety of biological processes. Here, we constructed a computational pipeline to identify lncRNA genes in the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), a major insect pest of cruciferous vegetables. In total, 3,324 lncRNAs corresponding to 2,475 loci were identified from 13 RNA-Seq datasets, including samples from parasitized, insecticide-resistant strains and different developmental stages. The identified P. xylostella lncRNAs had shorter transcripts and fewer exons than protein-coding genes. Seven out of nine randomly selected lncRNAs were validated by strand-specific RT-PCR. In total, 54-172 lncRNAs were specifically expressed in the insecticide resistant strains, among which one lncRNA was located adjacent to the sodium channel gene. In addition, 63-135 lncRNAs were specifically expressed in different developmental stages, among which three lncRNAs overlapped or were located adjacent to the metamorphosis-associated genes. These lncRNAs were either strongly or weakly co-expressed with their overlapping or neighboring mRNA genes. In summary, we identified thousands of lncRNAs and presented evidence that lncRNAs might have key roles in conferring insecticide resistance and regulating the metamorphosis development in P. xylostella.

AB  - Background: Previous studies demonstrated that prognosis of germline deficiency in mismatch repair protein (dMMR) was different from that of sporadic dMMR. The underlying mechanism has not been studied. Methods: From a prospectively maintained database, we collected dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) patients identified by postoperative immunohistochemistry screening. According to genetic test, patients were grouped as Lynch-associated or sporadic dMMR. We compared the clinical-pathological features, prognosis, and immunoreactive differences between the two groups. By whole-exome sequencing and neoantigen detection pipeline, mutational frequencies and neoantigen burdens were also compared. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Sixty-seven sporadic dMMR and 85 Lynch-associated CRC patients were included in the study. Sporadic dMMR patients were older (P < .001) and their tumors were poorly differentiated (P - .03). The survival was better in the Lynch-associated group (P - .001). After adjustment, the difference still remained statistically significant (hazard ratio = 0.29, 95% confidence interval = 0.09 to 0.95, P = .04). The scores of Crohn's-like reaction (CRO; P < .001), immunoreactions in the invasive margin (IM; P = .01), tumor stroma (TS; P = .009), and cancer nest (CN; P = .02) of the Lynch-associated group were statistically significantly higher. The numbers of CD3+, CD8 t , Poxp31 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in IM; CD3 , CD41 TILs in TS; and CD31 , CD4 t , CD81 TILs in CN were statistically significantly higher in Lynch-associated dMMR patients. Based on the 16 patients who under went whole-exome sequencing, there were also more somatic mutations and neoantigen burdens in the Lynch-associated group compared with the sporadic dMMR group (439/pt vs 68/pt, P = .006; 628/pt vs 97/pt, P = .009). Conclusions: There are heterogeneities in dMMR CRCs. Lynch-associated dMMR patients present with more somatic mutations and neoantigens compared with sporadic dMMR, which probably results in stronger immunoreactions and survival improvement.

AB  - Background: Recent advances in genomics methodologies, in particular the availability of next-generation sequencing approaches have made it possible to identify risk loci throughout the genome, in particular the exome. In the current study, we present findings from an exome study conducted in five affected individuals of a multiplex family with cleft palate only. Methods: The GEnome MINIng (GEMINI) pipeline was used to functionally annotate the single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions. Filtering methods were applied to identify variants that are clinically relevant and present in affected individuals at minor allele frequencies (<1%) in the 1000 Genomes Project single nucleotide polymorphism database, Exome Aggregation Consortium, and Exome Variant Server databases. The bioinformatics tool Systems Tool for Craniofacial Expression-Based Gene Discovery was used to prioritize cleft candidates in our list of variants, and Sanger sequencing was used to validate the presence of identified variants in affected and unaffected relatives. Results: Our analyses approach narrowed the candidates down to the novel missense variant in ARHGAP29 (GenBank: NM_004815.3, NP_004806.3; c.1654T>C [p.Ser552Pro]. A functional assay in zebrafish embryos showed that the encoded protein lacks the activity possessed by its wild-type counterpart, and migration assays revealed that keratinocytes transfected with wild-type ARHGAP29 migrated faster than counterparts transfected with the p. Ser552Pro ARHGAP29 variant or empty vector (control). Conclusion: These findings reveal ARHGAP29 to be a regulatory protein essential for proper development of the face, identifies an amino acid that is key for this, and provides a potential new diagnostic tool.

AB  - It is of urgency to effectively identify differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. In this paper, we proposed a novel method, joint-L-2,L-1-norm-constraint-based semi-supervised feature extraction (L21SFE), to analyze RNA-Seq data. Our scheme was shown as follows. Firstly, we constructed a graph Laplacian matrix and refined it by using the labeled samples. Our graph construction method can make full use of a large number of unlabelled samples. Secondly, we found semi-supervised optimal maps by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. Thirdly, we solved an optimal problem via the joint-L2,1-norm constraint to obtain a projection matrix. It can diminish the impact of noises and outliers by using the L-2,L-1-norm constraint and produce more precise results. Finally, we identified differentially expressed genes based on the projection matrix. The results on simulation and real RNA-Seq data sets demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our method.

AB  - Background: Endometrial cancers (ECs) are one of the most common types of malignant tumor in females. Substantial efforts had been made to identify significantly mutated genes (SMGs) in ECs and use them as biomarkers for the classification of histological subtypes and the prediction of clinical outcomes. However, the impact of non-significantly mutated genes (non-SMGs), which may also play important roles in the prognosis of EC patients, has not been extensively studied. Therefore, it is essential for the discovery of biomarkers in ECs to further investigate the non-SMGs that were highly associated with clinical outcomes. Results: For the 9681 non-SMGs reported by the mutation annotation pipeline, there were 1053, 1273 and 395 non-SMGs differentially expressed between the patient groups divided by the clinical endpoints of histological grade, histological type as well as the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage of ECs, respectively. In the gene set enrichment analysis, the cancer-related pathways, namely neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway, were significantly enriched with the differentially expressed non-SMGs for all the three endpoints. We further identified 23, 19 and 24 non-SMGs, which were highly associated with histological grade, histological type and FIGO stage, respectively, from the differentially expressed non-SMGs by using the variable combination population analysis (VCPA) approach and found that 69.6% (16/23), 78.9% (15/19) and 66.7% (16/24) of the identified non-SMGs had been previously reported to be correlated with cancers. In addition, the averaged areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) achieved by the predictive models with identified non-SMGs as predictors in predicting histological type, histological grade, and FIGO stage were 0.993, 0.961 and 0.832, respectively, which were superior to those achieved by the models with SMGs as features (averaged AUCs = 0.928, 0.864 and 0.535, resp.). Conclusions: Besides the SMGs, the non-SMGs reported in the mutation annotation analysis may also involve the crucial genes that were highly associated with clinical outcomes. Combining the mutation status with the gene expression profiles can efficiently identify the cancer-related non-SMGs as predictors for cancer prognostic prediction and provide more supplemental candidates for the discovery of biomarkers.

AB  - Background: Transcriptomic profiling of ex vivo cultured human limbal epithelial stem cells (hLESCs) will foster better understanding of corneal physiology and novel treatment paradigms to limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). However, currently such profiling studies are hampered due to difficulties with producing sufficient amounts of intact mRNA for deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from subpopulations sorted on the basis of co-expression of membrane and intracellular antigens by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Methods: To address this problem, we systematically analyzed the critical steps, and found that ethanol fixation together with optimized downstream procedures provided a pipeline that yielded high quality total RNA in amounts to readily support the RNA-seq procedure, while still preserving good discrimination between the individual hLESC immunophenotypes. Results: The average RNA integrity number (RIN) was 7.7 +/- 0.4, and the average yield was 4.6 +/- 1.7 pg of RNA per cell. The sequencing analysis of the isolated RNA produced high quality data with more than 70% of read pairs mapping uniformly to the reference genome and 80% of bases with a Phred score of at least 30. Conclusion: In this study, we developed a reliable FACS-based procedure using ethanol as a fixative that would support accurate isolation of limbal epithelial progenitor subpopulations along with RNA yield and quality sufficient to enable deep transcriptomic profiling.

AB  - Growth and replication of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii within host cell entail the production of several effector proteins, which the parasite exploits for counteracting the host's immune response. Despite considerable research to define the host signaling pathways manipulated by T. gondii and their effectors, there has been limited progress into understanding how individual members of the dense granule proteins (GRAs) modulate gene expression within host cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether T. gondii GRA15 protein plays any role in regulating host gene expression. Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) were transfected with plasmids encoding GRA15 genes of either type I GT1 strain (GRA15(I)) or type II PRU strain (GRA15(II)). Gene expression patterns of transfected and nontransfected BHK-21 cells were investigated using RNA-sequencing analysis. GRA15(I) and GRA15(II) induced both known and novel transcriptional changes in the transfected BHK-21 cells compared with nontransfected cells. Pathway analysis revealed that GRA15(II) was mainly involved in the regulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), NF-kappa B, HTLV-I infection, and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. GRA15(I) preferentially influenced the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in host cells. Our findings support the hypothesis that certain functions of GRA15 protein are strain dependent and that GRA15 modulates the expression of signaling pathways and genes with important roles in T. gondii pathophysiology. A greater understanding of host signaling pathways influenced by T. gondii effectors would allow the development of more efficient anti-T. gondii therapeutic schemes, capitalizing on disrupting parasite virulence factors to advance the treatment of toxoplasmosis.

AB  - Background: PD-1 plays a critical part in control of immune response to malignancy. Anti-PD-1 treatment is a hopeful strategy to improve the dismal prognosis of gliomas. To characterize the role of PD-1 in diffuse gliomas, we investigated its related biological process at transcriptome level and its clinical prognostic value. Method and patients: Through Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas and TCGA datasets, we systematically reviewed a total of 994 cases with RNA-seq data and analyzed the functional annotation of PD-1 by Gene ontology (GO) analysis. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis were performed in 907 patients with survival data. Results: We found PD-1 was significantly upregulated in glioblastoma and isocitrate dehydrogenase wild type tumors. According to TCGA transcriptional classification scheme, PD-1 expression was higher in tumors of mesenchymal subtype than other subtypes, and shown good predictive value to mesenchymal subtype. GO analysis revealed that genes significantly correlated with PD-1 were involved in essential functions associated with anti-tumor immune process. Through screening transcriptomic data, we found a strong correlation between PD-1 and immune cell populations especially for T cells. In addition, we investigated the association between PD-1 and genes related to its function, and found that PD-1 was significantly correlated with genes including TGFB1, IDO1, CD40, ICOS and SATB1, and other immune checkpoint molecules including CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3 and CD276. Survival analysis suggested that higher PD-1 expression was independently associated with worse prognosis of patients with diffuse gliomas. Conclusion: Our results indicated that PD-1 was involved in key steps of anti-tumor immune process and independently predicted worse prognosis in diffuse gliomas. These findings may expend our understanding of potential anti-PD-1 treatments.

AB  - Translation is a key regulatory step, linking transcriptome and proteome. Two major methods of translatome investigations are RNC-seq (sequencing of translating mRNA) and Ribo-seq (ribosome profiling). To facilitate the investigation of translation, we built a comprehensive database TranslatomeDB (http://www.translatomedb.net/) which provides collection and integrated analysis of published and user-generated translatome sequencing data. The current version includes 2453 Ribo-seq, 10 RNC-seq and their 1394 corresponding mRNA-seq datasets in 13 species. The database emphasizes the analysis functions in addition to the dataset collections. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis can be performed between any two datasets of same species and type, both on transcriptome and translatome levels. The translation indices translation ratios, elongation velocity index and translational efficiency can be calculated to quantitatively evaluate translational initiation efficiency and elongation velocity, respectively. All datasets were analyzed using a unified, robust, accurate and experimentally-verifiable pipeline based on the FANSe3 mapping algorithm and edgeR for DGE analyzes. TranslatomeDB also allows users to upload their own datasets and utilize the identical unified pipeline to analyze their data. We believe that our TranslatomeDB is a comprehensive platform and knowledgebase on translatome and proteome research, releasing the biologists from complex searching, analyzing and comparing huge sequencing data without needing local computational power.

AB  - Bacterial regulatory RNAs have been extensively studied for over a decade, and are progressively being integrated into the complex genetic regulatory network. Transcriptomic arrays, recent deep-sequencing data and bioinformatics suggest that bacterial genomes produce hundreds of regulatory RNAs. However, while some have been authenticated, the existence of the others varies according to strains and growth conditions, and their detection fluctuates with the methodologies used for data acquisition and interpretation. For example, several small RNA (sRNA) candidates are now known to be parts of UTR transcripts. Accurate annotation of regulatory RNAs is a complex task essential for molecular and functional studies. We defined bona fide sRNAs as those that (i) likely act in trans and (ii) are not expressed from the opposite strand of a coding gene. Using published data and our own RNA-seq data, we reviewed hundreds of Staphylococcus aureus putative regulatory RNAs using the DETRPROK computational pipeline and visual inspection of expression data, addressing the question of which transcriptional signals correspond to sRNAs. We conclude that the model strain HG003, a NCTC8325 derivative commonly used for S. aureus genetic regulation studies, has only about 50 bona fide sRNAs, indicating that these RNAs are less numerous than commonly stated. Among them, about half are associated to the S. aureus sp. core genome and a quarter are possibly expressed in other Staphylococci. We hypothesize on their features and regulation using bioinformatic approaches.

AB  - Alternative splicing (AS) is a major source of transcript and proteome diversity, but examining AS in species without well-annotated reference genomes remains difficult. Research on both human and mouse has demonstrated the advantages of using Iso-Seq data for isoform-level transcriptome analysis, including the study of AS and gene fusion. We applied Iso-Seq to investigate AS in Amborella trichopoda, a phylogenetically pivotal species that is sister to all other living angiosperms. Our data show that, compared with RNA-Seq data, the Iso-Seq platform provides better recovery on large transcripts, new gene locus identification and gene model correction. Reference-based AS detection with Iso-Seq data identifies AS within a higher fraction of multi-exonic genes than observed for published RNA-Seq analysis (45.8% vs. 37.5%). These data demonstrate that the Iso-Seq approach is useful for detecting AS events. Using the Iso-Seq-defined transcript collection in Amborella as a reference, we further describe a pipeline for detection of AS isoforms from PacBio Iso-Seq without using a reference sequence (de novo). Results using this pipeline show a 66%-76% overall success rate in identifying AS events. This de novoAS detection pipeline provides a method to accurately characterize and identify bona fide alternatively spliced transcripts in any nonmodel system that lacks a reference genome sequence. Hence, our pipeline has huge potential applications and benefits to the broader biology community.

AB  - Analysis of de novo mutations (DNMs) from sequencing data of nuclear families has identified risk genes for many complex diseases, including multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Most of these efforts have focused on mutations in protein-coding sequences. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) strongly suggests that variants important to human diseases often lie in non-coding regions. Extending DNM-based approaches to non-coding sequences is challenging, however, because the functional significance of non-coding mutations is difficult to predict. We propose a statistical framework for analyzing DNMs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This method, TADA-Annotations (TADA-A), is a major advance of the TADA method we developed earlier for DNM analysis in coding regions. TADA-A is able to incorporate many functional annotations such as conservation and enhancer marks, to learn from data which annotations are informative of pathogenic mutations, and to combine both coding and non-coding mutations at the gene level to detect risk genes. It also supports meta-analysis of multiple DNM studies, while adjusting for study-specific technical effects. We applied TADA-A to WGS data of similar to 300 autism-affected family trios across five studies and discovered several autism risk genes. The software is freely available for all research uses.

AB  - Rapid advancements in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, coupled with the dramatic decrease in cost, have made NGS one of the leading approaches applied in cancer research. In addition, it is increasingly used in clinical practice for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Somatic (cancer-only) single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions (indels) are the simplest classes of mutation, however, their identification in whole exome sequencing data is complicated by germline polymorphisms, tumor heterogeneity and errors in sequencing and analysis. An increasing number of software and methodological guidelines are being published for the analysis of sequencing data. Usually, the algorithms of MuTect, VarScan and Genome Analysis Toolkit are applied to identify the variants. However, one of these algorithms alone results in incomplete genomic information. To address this issue, the present study developed a systematic pipeline for analyzing the whole exome sequencing data of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a combination of the three algorithms, named the three-caller pipeline. Application of the three-caller pipeline to the whole exome data of HCC, improved the detection of true positive mutations and a total of 75 tumor-specific somatic variants were identified. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the mutations in the genes encoding cell adhesion and regulation of Ras GTPase activity. This pipeline provides an effective approach to identify variants from NGS data for subsequent functional analyses.

AB  - Holm oak (Quercus ilex) is the most important and representative species of the Mediterranean forest and of the Spanish agrosilvo-pastoral "dehesa" ecosystem. Despite its environmental and economic interest, Holm oak is an orphan species whose biology is very little known, especially at the molecular level. In order to increase the knowledge on the chemical composition and metabolism of this tree species, the employment of a holistic and multi-omics approach, in the Systems Biology direction would be necessary. However, for orphan and recalcitrant plant species, specific analytical and bioinformatics tools have to be developed in order to obtain adequate quality and data-density before to coping with the study of its biology. By using a plant sample consisting of a pool generated by mixing equal amounts of homogenized tissue from acorn embryo, leaves, and roots, protocols for transcriptome (NGS-Illumina), proteome (shotgun LC-MS/MS), and metabolome (GC-MS) studies have been optimized. These analyses resulted in the identification of around 62629 transcripts, 2380 protein species, and 62 metabolites. Data are compared with those reported for model plant species, whose genome has been sequenced and is well annotated, including Arabidopsis, japonica rice, poplar, and eucalyptus. RNA and protein sequencing favored each other, increasing the number and confidence of the proteins identified and correcting erroneous RNA sequences. The integration of the large amount of data reported using bioinformatics tools allows the Holm oak metabolic network to be partially reconstructed: from the 127 metabolic pathways reported in KEGG pathway database, 123 metabolic pathways can be visualized when using the described methodology. They included: carbohydrate and energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The TCA cycle was the pathway most represented with 5 out of 10 metabolites, 6 out of 8 protein enzymes, and 8 out of 8 enzyme transcripts. On the other hand, gaps, missed pathways, included metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides and lipid metabolism. The multi-omics resource generated in this work will set the basis for ongoing and future studies, bringing the Holm oak closer to model species, to obtain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypes of interest (productive, tolerant to environmental cues, nutraceutical value) and to select elite genotypes to be used in restoration and reforestation programs, especially in a future climate change scenario.

AB  - BackgroundLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important component of mammalian genomes, where their numbers are even larger than that of protein-coding genes. For example, human (Homo sapiens) (96,308 vs. 20,376) and mouse (Mus musculus) (87,774 vs. 22,630) have more lncRNA genes than protein-coding genes in the NONCODEv5 database. Recently, mammalian lncRNAs were reported to play critical roles in immune response to influenza A virus infections. Such observation inspired us to identify lncRNAs related to immune response to influenza A virus in duck, which is the most important natural host of influenza A viruses.ResultsWe explored features of 62,447 lncRNAs from human, mouse, chicken, zebrafish and elegans, and developed a pipeline to identify lncRNAs using the identified features with transcriptomic data. We then collected 151,970 assembled transcripts from RNA-Seq data of 21 individuals from three tissues and annotated 4094 duck lncRNAs. Comparing to duck protein-coding transcripts, we found that 4094 lncRNAs had smaller number of exons (2.4 vs. 10.2) and longer length of transcripts (1903.0bp vs. 1686.9bp) on average. Among them, 3586 (87.6%) lncRNAs located in intergenic regions and 619 lncRNAs showed differential expression in ducks infected by H5N1 virus when compared to control individuals. 58 lncRNAs were involved into two co-expressional modules related to anti-influenza A virus immune response. Moreover, we confirmed that eight lncRNAs showed remarkably differential expression both in vivo (duck individuals) and in vitro (duck embryo fibroblast cells, DEF cells) after infected with H5N1 viruses, implying they might play important roles in response to influenza A virus infection.ConclusionsThis study presented an example to annotate lncRNA in new species based on model species using transcriptome data. These data and analysis provide information for duck lncRNAs' function in immune response to influenza A virus.

AB  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is widely used to study gene expression changes associated with treatments or biological conditions. Many popular methods for detecting differential expression (DE) from RNA-seq data use generalized linear models (GLMs) fitted to the read counts across independent replicate samples for each gene. This article shows that the standard formula for the residual degrees of freedom (d.f.) in a linear model is overstated when the model contains fitted values that are exactly zero. Such fitted values occur whenever all the counts in a treatment group are zero as well as in more complex models such as those involving paired comparisons. This misspecification results in underestimation of the genewise variances and loss of type I error control. This article proposes a formula for the reduced residual d.f. that restores error control in simulated RNA-seq data and improves detection of DE genes in a real data analysis. The new approach is implemented in the quasi-likelihood framework of the edgeR software package. The results of this article also apply to RNA-seq analyses that apply linear models to log-transformed counts, such as those in the limma software package, and more generally to any count-based GLM where exactly zero fitted values are possible.

AB  - BackgroundAs an important biomass raw material, the lignocellulose in bamboo is of significant value in energy conversion. The conversion of bamboo lignocellulose into fermentable reducing sugar, i.e. the degradation of bamboo lignocellulose, is an important step in lignocellulose conversion. However, little research has focussed on excavating the enzymes and microbes that are related to the degradation of bamboo lignocellulose, which is important for its utilisation. This study used Cyrtotrachelus buqueti (bamboo snout beetle) to evaluate the efficiency of bamboo lignocellulose degradation.ResultsRNA sequencing was conducted to sequence the transcriptome of the insect before and after feeding on bamboo shoots. The expression levels of genes encoding several carbohydrate-active enzymes, such as endoglucanase (evgtrinloc27093t1 and evgtrinloc16407t0) and laccase (evgtrinloc15173t0 and evgtrinloc11252t0), were found to be upregulated after feeding. Faecal component analysis showed that the degradation efficiencies of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were 61.82%, 87.65% and 69.05%, respectively. After 6days of co-culture with crude enzymes in vitro, the degradation efficiencies of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in bamboo shoot particles (BSPs) were 24.98%, 37.52% and 26.67%, respectively. These results indicated that lignocellulosic enzymes and related enzymes within the insect itself co-degraded bamboo lignocellulose. These finding can potentially be used for the pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of bamboo lignocellulose.ConclusionOur results showed that intestinal digestive enzymes from C. buqueti degraded bamboo shoot lignocellulose both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the expression levels of many carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes were upregulated in the transcriptome, including those for cellulase, xylanase and ligninase genes. Therefore, we proposed a scheme for applying the lignocellulolytic enzymes from C. buqueti to degrade bamboo lignocellulose using genetic, enzymatic and fermentation engineering techniques to overexpress the lignocellulolytic enzymes genes in vitro and obtain large quantities of enzymes that could efficiently degrade bamboo lignocellulose and be used for lignocellulose bioconversion.

AB  - BackgroundA statistical pipeline was developed and used for determining candidate genes and candidate gene coexpression networks involved in 2 alcohol (i.e., ethanol [EtOH]) metabolism phenotypes, namely alcohol clearance and acetate area under the curve in a recombinant inbred (RI) (HXB/BXH) rat panel. The approach was also used to provide an indication of how EtOH metabolism can impact the normal function of the identified networks. MethodsRNA was extracted from alcohol-naive liver tissue of 30 strains of HXB/BXH RI rats. The reconstructed transcripts were quantitated, and data were used to construct gene coexpression modules and networks. A separate group of rats, comprising the same 30 strains, were injected with EtOH (2g/kg) for measurement of blood EtOH and acetate levels. These data were used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of the rate of EtOH disappearance and circulating acetate levels. The analysis pipeline required calculation of the module eigengene values, the correction of these values with EtOH metabolism rates and acetate levels across the rat strains, and the determination of the eigengene QTLs. For a module to be considered a candidate for determining phenotype, the module eigengene values had to have significant correlation with the strain phenotypic values and the module eigengene QTLs had to overlap the phenotypic QTLs. ResultsOf the 658 transcript coexpression modules generated from liver RNA sequencing data, a single module satisfied all criteria for being a candidate for determining the alcohol clearance trait. This module contained 2 alcohol dehydrogenase genes, including the gene whose product was previously shown to be responsible for the majority of alcohol elimination in the rat. This module was also the only module identified as a candidate for influencing circulating acetate levels. This module was also linked to the process of generation and utilization of retinoic acid as related to the autonomous immune response. ConclusionsWe propose that our analytical pipeline can successfully identify genetic regions and transcripts which predispose a particular phenotype and our analysis provides functional context for coexpression module components.

AB  - Background3' RNA sequencing provides an alternative to whole transcript analysis. However, we do not know a priori the relative advantage of each method. Thus, a comprehensive comparison between the whole transcript and the 3 method is needed to determine their relative merits. To this end, we used two commercially available library preparation kits, the KAPA Stranded mRNA-Seq kit (traditional method) and the Lexogen QuantSeq 3' mRNA-Seq kit (3 method), to prepare libraries from mouse liver RNA. We then sequenced and analyzed the libraries to determine the advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches.ResultsWe found that the traditional whole transcript method and the 3' RNA-Seq method had similar levels of reproducibility. As expected, the whole transcript method assigned more reads to longer transcripts, while the 3 method assigned roughly equal numbers of reads to transcripts regardless of their lengths. We found that the 3' RNA-Seq method detected more short transcripts than the whole transcript method. With regard to differential expression analysis, we found that the whole transcript method detected more differentially expressed genes, regardless of the level of sequencing depth.ConclusionsThe 3' RNA-Seq method was better able to detect short transcripts, while the whole transcript RNA-Seq was able to detect more differentially expressed genes. Thus, both approaches have relative advantages and should be selected based on the goals of the experiment.

AB  - Proteogenomics methods have identified many non-annotated protein-coding genes in the human genome. Many of the newly discovered protein-coding genes encode peptides and small proteins, referred to collectively as microproteins. Microproteins are produced through ribosome translation of small open reading frames (smORFs). The discovery of many smORFs reveals a blind spot in traditional gene-finding algorithms for these genes. Biological studies have found roles for microproteins in cell biology and physiology, and the potential that there exists additional bioactive microproteins drives the interest in detection and discovery of these molecules. A key step in any proteogenomics workflow is the assembly of RNA-Seq data into likely mRNA transcripts that are then used to create a searchable protein database. Here we demonstrate that specific features of the assembled transcriptome impact microprotein detection by shotgun proteomics. By tailoring transcript assembly for downstream mass spectrometry searching, we show that we can detect more than double the number of high-quality microprotein candidates and introduce a novel open-source mRNA assembler for proteogenomics (MAPS) that incorporates all of these features. By integrating our specialized assembler, MAPS, and a popular generalized assembler into our proteogenomics pipeline, we detect 45 novel human microproteins from a high quality proteogenomics dataset of a human cell line. We then characterize the features of the novel microproteins, identifying two classes of microproteins. Our work highlights the importance of specialized transcriptome assembly upstream of proteomics validation when searching for short and potentially rare and poorly conserved proteins.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs, are key regulators of gene expression at post transcriptional level and play essential roles in biological processes such as development. MiRNAs silence target mRNAs by binding to complementary sequences in the 3 ' untranslated regions (3 ' UTRs). The parasitic helminths of the genus Echinococcus are the causative agents of echinococcosis, a zoonotic neglected disease. In previous work, we performed a comprehensive identification and characterization of Echinococcus miRNAs. However, current knowledge about their targets is limited. Since target prediction algorithms rely on complementarity between 3 ' UTRs and miRNA sequences, a major limitation is the lack of accurate sequence information of 3 ' UTR for most species including parasitic helminths. We performed RNA-seq and developed a pipeline that integrates the transcriptomic data with available genomic data of this parasite in order to identify 3 ' UTRs of Echinococcus canadensis. The high confidence set of 3 ' UTRs obtained allowed the prediction of miRNA targets in Echinococcus through a bioinformatic approach. We performed for the first time a comparative analysis of miRNA targets in Echinococcus and Taenia. We found that many evolutionarily conserved target sites in Echinococcus and Taenia may be functional and under selective pressure. Signaling pathways such as MAPK and Wnt were among the most represented pathways indicating miRNA roles in parasite growth and development. Genome-wide identification and characterization of miRNA target genes in Echinococcus provide valuable information to guide experimental studies in order to understand miRNA functions in the parasites biology. miRNAs involved in essential functions, especially those being absent in the host or showing sequence divergence with respect to host orthologs, might be considered as novel therapeutic targets for echinococcosis control.

AB  - Here, we describe a mother and son with a lifelong bleeding tendency and posttraumatic bleeding who were recruited to the UK Genotyping and Phenotyping of Platelets (GAPP) study with a suspected platelet function disorder. However, despite a clinically significant bleeding score, both had normal platelet counts and normal platelet function. The patients' blood was analyzed by light transmission aggregometry and genotyping by whole exome sequencing, as outlined by the GAPP study. Approximately 25 000 genetic variants were found for each patient as a result of sequencing and were filtered using a specialized bioinformatics pipeline. A heterozygous variant displaying autosomal dominant inheritance (c.1611 C>A) was found in the gene THBD which encodes the glycoprotein thrombomodulin. This sequence change results in a stop codon (p.Cys537Stop) and truncation of the protein and has been previously described in two other families with bleeding events which suggests it may be a recurrent mutation. In summary, this study shows that patients with a suspected platelet disorder but who present with a normal pattern of platelet aggregation should be investigated for defects in nonplatelet genes.

AB  - The advent of next-generation sequencing has resulted in transcriptome-based approaches to investigate functionally significant biological components in a variety of non-model organism. This has resulted in the area of "venomics": a rapidly growing field using combined transcriptomic and proteomic datasets to characterize toxin diversity in a variety of venomous taxa. Ultimately, the transcriptomic portion of these analyses follows very similar pathways after transcriptome assembly often including candidate toxin identification using BLAST, expression level screening, protein sequence alignment, gene tree reconstruction, and characterization of potential toxin function. Here we describe the Python package Venomix, which streamlines these processes using common bioinformatic tools along with ToxProt, a publicly available annotated database comprised of characterized venom proteins. In this study, we use the Venomix pipeline to characterize candidate venom diversity in four phylogenetically distinct organisms, a cone snail (Conidae; Conus sponsalis), a snake (Viperidae; Echis coloratus), an ant (Formicidae; Tetramorium bicarinatum), and a scorpion (Scorpionidae; Urodacus yaschenkoi). Data on these organisms were sampled from public databases, with each original analysis using different approaches for transcriptome assembly, toxin identification, or gene expression quantification, Venomix recovered numerically more candidate toxin transcripts for three of the four transcriptomes than the original analyses and identified new toxin candidates. In summary, we show that the Venomix package is a useful tool to identify and characterize the diversity of toxin-like transcripts derived from transcriptomic datasets. Venomix is available at: https://bitbucket.org/jasonMacrander/Venomix/.

AB  - We introduce the CDRP (Concatenated Diagnostic-Relapse Prognostic) architecture for multi-task deep learning that incorporates a clinical algorithm, e.g., a risk stratification schema to improve prognostic profiling. We present the first application to survival prediction in High-Risk (HR) Neuroblastoma from transcriptomics data, a task that studies from the MAQC consortium have shown to remain the hardest among multiple diagnostic and prognostic endpoints predictable from the same dataset. To obtain a more accurate risk stratification needed for appropriate treatment strategies, CDRP combines a first component (CDRP-A) synthesizing a diagnostic task and a second component (CDRP-N) dedicated to one or more prognostic tasks. The approach leverages the advent of semi-supervised deep learning structures that can flexibly integrate multimodal data or internally create multiple processing paths. CDRP-A is an autoencoder trained on gene expression on the HR/non-HR risk stratification by the Children's Oncology Group, obtaining a 64-node representation in the bottleneck layer. CDRP-N is a multi-task classifier for two prognostic endpoints, i.e., Event-Free Survival (EFS) and Overall Survival (OS). CDRP-A provides the HR embedding input to the CDRP-N shared layer, from which two branches depart to model EFS and OS, respectively. To control for selection bias, CDRP is trained and evaluated using a Data Analysis Protocol (DAP) developed within the MAQC initiative. CDRP was applied on Illumina RNA-Seq of 498 Neuroblastoma patients (HR: 176) from the SEQC study (12,464 Entrez genes) and on Affymetrix Human Exon Array expression profiles (17,450 genes) of 247 primary diagnostic Neuroblastoma of the TARGET NBL cohort. On the SEQC HR patients, CDRP achieves Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) 0.38 for EFS and MCC = 0.19 for OS in external validation, improving over published SEQC models. We show that a CDRP-N embedding is indeed parametrically associated to increasing severity and the embedding can be used to better stratify patients' survival.

AB  - Lynch syndrome (LS) is a cancer predisposition disorder wherein patients have a 70-80% lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancers (CRC). Finding germline mutations in predisposing genes allows for risk assessment of CRC development. Here we report a germline heterozygous frame-shift mutation in the mismatch repair MLH1 gene which was identified in members of two unrelated LS families. Since defects in DNA mismatch repair genes generate frame-shift mutations giving rise to highly immunogenic neoepitopes, we postulated that vaccination with these mutant peptide antigens could offer promising treatment options to LS patients. To this end we performed whole-exome and RNA seq analysis on the blood and tumour samples from an LS-CRC patient, and used our proprietary neoepitope prioritization pipeline OncoPeptVAC to select peptides, and confirm their immunogenicity in an ex vivo CD8(+) T cell activation assay. Three neoepitopes derived from the tumour of this patient elicited a potent CD8(+) T cell response. Furthermore, analysis of the tumour-associated immune infiltrate revealed CD8(+) T cells expressing low levels of activation markers, suggesting mechanisms of immune suppression at play in this relapsed tumour. Taken together, our study paves the way towards development of a cancer vaccine to treat or delay the onset/relapse of LS-CRC.

AB  - Functional RNAs can fold into intricate structures using a number of different secondary and tertiary structural motifs. Many factors contribute to the overall free energy of the target fold. This study aims at quantifying the entropic costs coming from the loss of conformational freedom when the sugar-phosphate backbone is subjected to constraints imposed by secondary and tertiary contacts. Motivated by insights from topology theory, we design a diagrammatic scheme to represent different types of RNA structures so that constraints associated with a folded structure may be segregated into mutually independent subsets, enabling the total conformational entropy loss to be easily calculated as a sum of independent terms. We used high-throughput Monte Carlo simulations to simulate large ensembles of single-stranded RNA sequences in solution to validate the assumptions behind our diagrammatic scheme, examining the entropic costs for hairpin initiation and formation of many multiway junctions. Our diagrammatic scheme aids in the factorization of secondary/tertiary constraints into distinct topological classes and facilitates the discovery of interrelationships among multiple constraints on RNA folds. This perspective, which to our knowledge is novel, leads to useful insights into the inner workings of some functional RNA sequences, demonstrating how they might operate by transforming their structures among different topological classes.

AB  - Sequencing of total RNA enables the study of the whole plant transcriptome resulting from the simultaneous expression of the three genomes of plant cells (located in the nucleus, mitochondrion and chloroplast). While commonly used for the quantification of the nuclear gene expression, this method remains complex and challenging when applied to organellar genomes and/ or when used to quantify posttranscriptional RNA maturations. Here we propose a complete bioinformatical and statistical pipeline to fully characterize the differences in the chloroplast transcriptome between two conditions. Experimental design as well as bioinformatics and statistical analyses are described in order to quantify both gene expression and RNA posttranscriptional maturations, i.e., RNA splicing, editing, and processing, and identify statistically significant differences.

AB  - Motivation: De novo transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq offers a promising means to study gene expression in non-model organisms. Yet, the difficulty of transcriptome assembly means that the contigs provided by the assembler often represent a fractured and incomplete view of the transcriptome, complicating downstream analysis. We introduce Grouper, a new method for clustering contigs from de novo assemblies that are likely to belong to the same transcripts and genes; these groups can subsequently be analyzed more robustly. When provided with access to the genome of a related organism, Grouper can transfer annotations to the de novo assembly, further improving the clustering. Results: On de novo assemblies from four different species, we show that Grouper is able to accurately cluster a larger number of contigs than the existing state-of-the-art method. The Grouper pipeline is able to map greater than 10% more reads against the contigs, leading to accurate downstream differential expression analyses. The labeling module, in the presence of a closely related annotated genome, can efficiently transfer annotations to the contigs and use this information to further improve clustering. Overall, Grouper provides a complete and efficient pipeline for processing de novo transcriptomic assemblies. Availability and implementation: The Grouper software is freely available at https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/grouper under the 2-clause BSD license.

AB  - BackgroundGene signatures are important to represent the molecular changes in the disease genomes or the cells in specific conditions, and have been often used to separate samples into different groups for better research or clinical treatment. While many methods and applications have been available in literature, there still lack powerful ones that can take account of the complex data and detect the most informative signatures.MethodsIn this article, we present a new framework for identifying gene signatures using Pareto-optimal cluster size identification for RNA-seq data. We first performed pre-filtering steps and normalization, then utilized the empirical Bayes test in Limma package to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Next, we used a multi-objective optimization technique, Multi-objective optimization for collecting cluster alternatives (MOCCA in R package) on these DEGs to find Pareto-optimal cluster size, and then applied k-means clustering to the RNA-seq data based on the optimal cluster size. The best cluster was obtained through computing the average Spearman's Correlation Score among all the genes in pair-wise manner belonging to the module. The best cluster is treated as the signature for the respective disease or cellular condition.ResultsWe applied our framework to a cervical cancer RNA-seq dataset, which included 253 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples and 22 adenocarcinoma (ADENO) samples. We identified a total of 582 DEGs by Limma analysis of SCC versus ADENO samples. Among them, 260 are up-regulated genes and 322 are down-regulated genes. Using MOCCA, we obtained seven Pareto-optimal clusters. The best cluster has a total of 35 DEGs consisting of all-upregulated genes. For validation, we ran PAMR (prediction analysis for microarrays) classifier on the selected best cluster, and assessed the classification performance. Our evaluation, measured by sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy, showed high confidence.ConclusionsOur framework identified a multi-objective based cluster that is treated as a signature that can classify the disease and control group of samples with higher classification performance (accuracy 0.935) for the corresponding disease. Our method is useful to find signature for any RNA-seq or microarray data.

AB  - Intensive breeding of Brassica napus has resulted in relatively low diversity, such that B. napus would benefit from germplasm improvement schemes that sustain diversity. As such, samples representative of global germplasm pools need to be assessed for existing population structure, diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Complexity reduction genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) methods, including GBS-transcriptomics (GBS-t), enable cost-effective screening of a large number of samples, while whole genome re-sequencing (WGR) delivers the ability to generate large numbers of unbiased genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and identify structural variants (SVs). Furthermore, the development of genomic tools based on whole genomes representative of global oilseed diversity and orientated by the reference genome has substantial industry relevance and will be highly beneficial for canola breeding. As recent studies have focused on European and Chinese varieties, a global diversity panel as well as a substantial number of Australian spring types were included in this study. Focusing on industry relevance, 633 varieties were initially genotyped using GBS-t to examine population structure using 61,037 SNPs. Subsequently, 149 samples representative of global diversity were selected for WGR and both data sets used for a side-by-side evaluation of diversity and LD. The WGR data was further used to develop genomic resources consisting of a list of 4,029,750 high-confidence SNPs annotated using SnpEff, and SVs in the form of 10,976 deletions and 2,556 insertions. These resources form the basis of a reliable and repeatable system allowing greater integration between canola genomics studies, with a strong focus on breeding germplasm and industry applicability.

AB  - Mosaicism due to somatic mutations can cause multiple diseases including cancer, developmental and overgrowth syndromes, neurodevelopmental disorders, autoinflammatory diseases, and atrial fibrillation. With the increased use of next generation sequencing technology, multiple tools have been developed to identify low-frequency variants, specifically from matched tumor-normal tissues in cancer studies. To investigate whether mosaic variants are implicated in congenital heart disease (CHD), we developed a pipeline using the cancer somatic variant caller MuTect to identify mosaic variants in whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from a cohort of parent/affected child trios (n = 715) and a cohort of healthy individuals (n = 416). This is a novel application of the somatic variant caller designed for cancer to WES trio data. We identified two cases with mosaic KMT2D mutations that are likely pathogenic for CHD, but conclude that, overall, mosaicism detectable in peripheral blood or saliva does not account for a significant portion of CHD etiology.

AB  - The systematics of the genera and subgenera within the soft tick family Argasidae is not adequately resolved. Different classification schemes, reflecting diverse schools of scientific thought that elevated or downgraded groups to genera or subgenera, have been proposed. In the most recent classification scheme, Argas and Ornithodoros are paraphyletic and the placement of various subgenera remains uncertain because molecular data are lacking. Thus, reclassification of the Argasidae is required. This will enable an understanding of soft tick systematics within an evolutionary context. This study addressed that knowledge gap using mitochondrial genome and nuclear (18S and 28S ribosomal RNA) sequence data for representatives of the subgenera Alectorobius, Argas, Chiropterargas, Ogadenus, Ornamentum, Ornithodoros, Navis (subgen. nov.), Pavlovskyella, Persicargas, Proknekalia, Reticulinasus and Secretargas, from the Afrotropical, Nearctic and Palearctic regions. Hard tick species (Ixodidae) and a new representative of Nuttalliella namaqua (Nuttalliellidae), were also sequenced with a total of 83 whole mitochondrial genomes, 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA genes generated. The study confirmed the utility of next-generation sequencing to retrieve systematic markers. Paraphyly of Argas and Ornithodoros was resolved by systematic analysis and a new species list is proposed. This corresponds broadly with the morphological cladistic analysis of Klompen and Oliver (1993). Estimation of divergence times using molecular dating allowed dissection of phylogeographic patterns for argasid evolution. The discovery of cryptic species in the subgenera Chiropterargas, Ogadenus and Ornithodoros, suggests that cryptic speciation is common within the Argasidae. Cryptic speciation has implications for past biological studies of soft ticks. These are discussed in particular for the Ornithodoros (Ornithodoros) moubata and Ornithodoros (Ornithodoros) savignyi groups.

AB  - Background: Transcriptome interpretation relies on a good-quality reference transcriptome for accurate quantification of gene expression as well as functional analysis of genetic variants. The current annotation of the horse genome lacks the specificity and sensitivity necessary to assess gene expression especially at the isoform level, and suffers from insufficient annotation of untranslated regions (UTR) usage. We built an annotation pipeline for horse and used it to integrate 1.9 billion reads from multiple RNA-seq data sets into a new refined transcriptome. Results: This equine transcriptome integrates eight different tissues from 59 individuals and improves gene structure and isoform resolution, while providing considerable tissue-specific information. We utilized four levels of transcript filtration in our pipeline, aimed at producing several transcriptome versions that are suitable for different downstream analyses. Our most refined transcriptome includes 36,876 genes and 76,125 isoforms, with 6474 candidate transcriptional loci novel to the equine transcriptome. Conclusions: We have employed a variety of descriptive statistics and figures that demonstrate the quality and content of the transcriptome. The equine transcriptomes that are provided by this pipeline show the best tissue-specific resolution of any equine transcriptome to date and are flexible for several downstream analyses. We encourage the integration of further equine transcriptomes with our annotation pipeline to continue and improve the equine transcriptome.

AB  - Most of the research studies developed applying microarray technology to the characterization of different pathological states of any disease may fail in reaching statistically significant results. This is largely due to the small repertoire of analysed samples, and to the limitation in the number of states or pathologies usually addressed. Moreover, the influence of potential deviations on the gene expression quantification is usually disregarded. In spite of the continuous changes in omic sciences, reflected for instance in the emergence of new Next-Generation Sequencing-related technologies, the existing availability of a vast amount of gene expression microarray datasets should be properly exploited. Therefore, this work proposes a novel methodological approach involving the integration of several heterogeneous skin cancer series, and a later multiclass classifier design. This approach is thus a way to provide the clinicians with an intelligent diagnosis support tool based on the use of a robust set of selected biomarkers, which simultaneously distinguishes among different cancerrelated skin states. To achieve this, a multi-platform combination of microarray datasets from Affymetrix and Illumina manufacturers was carried out. This integration is expected to strengthen the statistical robustness of the study as well as the finding of highly-reliable skin cancer biomarkers. Specifically, the designed operation pipeline has allowed the identification of a small subset of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from which to distinguish among 7 involved skin states. These genes were obtained from the assessment of a number of potential batch effects on the gene expression data. The biological interpretation of these genes was inspected in the specific literature to understand their underlying information in relation to skin cancer. Finally, in order to assess their possible effectiveness in cancer diagnosis, a cross-validation Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based classification including feature ranking was performed. The accuracy attained exceeded the 92% in overall recognition of the 7 different cancer-related skin states. The proposed integration scheme is expected to allow the co-integration with other state-of-the-art technologies such as RNA-seq.

AB  - Metagenomics is a powerful tool for assessing the functional and taxonomic contents in biological samples as it makes feasible to study, simultaneously, the whole living community related to a host organism or medium: all the microbes, including virus, bacteria, archaea, fungi, and protists. New DNA and RNA sequencing technologies are dramatically decreasing the cost per sequenced base, so metagenomic sequencing is becoming more and more widespread in biomedical and environmental research. This is opening the possibility of complete longitudinal metagenomic studies, which could unravel the dynamics of microbial communities including intra-microbiome and host-microbiome interactions through in-depth analysis of time series. For viruses, this is particularly interesting because it allows broad interaction studies of viruses and hosts in different time scales, as in bacteria-phages coevolution studies. This chapter presents computational methods for an automatic and robust analysis of metagenomic time series in virome metagenomics (RATSVM). The same theoretical frame and computational protocol is also suitable for longitudinal studies of spatial series to uncover the dynamics of a microbial community with viruses along a selected dimension in the space. In order to conveniently illustrate the procedure, real data from a published virome study is used. The computational protocol presented here requires only basic computational knowledge. Several scripts have been prepared to ease and automate the most complicate steps, they are available in the RATSVM public repository. For some of the methods a mid-range computing server is advisable, and for some others, it is required. A fat-node with large memory and fast I/O would be the best choice for optimum results.

AB  - Intron retention, one of the most prevalent alternative splicing events in plants, can lead to introns retained in mature mRNAs. However, in comparison with constitutively spliced introns (CSIs), the relevantly distinguishable features for retained introns (RIs) are still poorly understood. This work proposes a computational pipeline to discover novel RIs from multiple next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets of Arabidopsis thaliana. Using this pipeline, we detected 3,472 novel RIs from 18 RNA-Seq datasets and re-confirmed 1,384 RIs which are currently annotated in the TAIR10 database. We also use the expression of intron-containing isoforms as a new feature in addition to the conventional features. Based on these features, RIs are highly distinguishable from CSIs by machine learning methods, especially when the expressional odds of retention (i.e., the expression ratio of the RI-containing isoforms relative to the isoforms without RIs for the same gene) reaches to or larger than 50/50. In this case, the RIs and CSIs can be clearly separated by the Random Forest with an outstanding performance of 0.95 on AUC (the area under a receiver operating characteristics curve). The closely related characteristics to the RIs include the low strength of splice sites, high similarity with the flanking exon sequences, low occurrence percentage of YTRAY near the acceptor site, existence of putative intronic splicing silencers (ISSs, i.e., AG/GA-rich motifs) and intronic splicing enhancers (ISEs, i.e., TTTT-containing motifs), and enrichment of Serine/Arginine-Rich (SR) proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle proteins (hnRNPs).

AB  - Rubus glaucus Benth (known as "mora de castilla") is a Colombian agricultural product, with probably, the major potential. This fruit combines features Idaeobatus and Rubus subgenera. Despite its recognized importance in the economy of small producers, this crop has received little technological development; as a result, sowing procedures of this specie is done by using local cultivars asexually propagated by producers. Associated Rubus producers in Colombia has noticed the necessity to formalize the offer of planting material, starting with plant breeding programs tending to the obtention of more productive varieties with morphological features that facilitates cultural activities. This study presents the results of the evaluation of SSR and SNPs markers obtained in previous experimental works from a RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis. It was evaluated 15 promissory R. glaucus cultivars, which could be potential progenitors in future breeding schemes. Genetic characterization was accomplished by testing 22 SSR microsatellite and 78 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers. From evaluated SSR markers, 15 yielded positive PCR amplification generating 29 loci and 58 alleles. From evaluated SNPs markers, 36 yielded positive PCR amplification. Obtained sequences from amplified products with SNPs showed high homology with species belonging to Rosaceae family. Selection criteria of progenitors were based on the results of molecular characterizations and useful morphological features in the culture management. This research demonstrates the utility of molecular markers to assess genetic diversity of potential progenitors susceptible to plant breeding processes. This process, highly known as development of parental populations, determines in a great manner the success of plant breeding processes. Index terms: Plant breeding, andean blackberry, genetic diversity.

AB  - Escherichia coli is one of the most widely used expression hosts for membrane proteins. However, establishing conditions for its recombinant production of membrane proteins remains difficult. Attempts to produce membrane proteins frequently result in either no expression or expression as misfolded aggregates. We developed an efficient pipeline for improving membrane protein overexpression in E. coli that is based on two approaches. The first involves transcriptional fusions, small additional RNA sequences upstream of the target open reading frame, to overcome no or poor overall expression levels. The other is based on a tunable promoter in combination with a fusion to green fluorescent protein serving as a reporter for the folding state of the target membrane protein. The latter combination allows adjusting the membrane protein expression rate to the downstream folding capacity, in order to decrease the formation of protein aggregates. This pipeline has proven successful for the efficient and parallel optimization of a diverse set of membrane proteins.

AB  - The advances in genomic sequencing during the past few years have motivated the development of fast and reliable software for DNA/RNA sequencing on current high performance architectures. Most of these efforts target multicore processors, only a few can also exploit graphics processing units, and a much smaller set will run in clusters equipped with any of these multi-threaded architecture technologies. Furthermore, the examples that can be used on clusters today are all strongly coupled with a particular aligner. In this paper we introduce an alignment framework that can be leveraged to coordinately run any single-node aligner, taking advantage of the resources of a cluster without having to modify any portion of the original software. The key to our transparent migration lies in hiding the complexity associated with the multi-node execution (such as coordinating the processes running in the cluster nodes) inside the generic-aligner framework. Moreover, following the design and operation in our Message Passing Interface (MPI) version of HPG Aligner RNA BWT, we organize the framework into two stages in order to be able to execute different aligners in each one of them. With this configuration, for example, the first stage can ideally apply a fast aligner to accelerate the process, while the second one can be tuned to act as a refinement stage that further improves the global alignment process with little cost.

AB  - The vascular plant pathogen Verticillium nonalfalfae causes Verticillium wilt in several important crops. VnaSSP4.2 was recently discovered as a V. nonalfalfae virulence effector protein in the xylem sap of infected hop. Here, we expanded our search for candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) in the V. nonalfalfae predicted secretome using a bioinformatic pipeline built on V. nonalfalfae genome data, RNA-Seq and proteomic studies of the interaction with hop. The secretome, rich in carbohydrate active enzymes, proteases, redox proteins and proteins involved in secondary metabolism, cellular processing and signaling, includes 263 CSEPs. Several homologs of known fungal effectors (LysM, NLPs, Hce2, Cerato-platanins, Cyanovirin-N lectins, hydrophobins and CFEM domain containing proteins) and avirulence determinants in the PHI database (Avr-Pita1 and MgSM1) were found. The majority of CSEPs were non-annotated and were narrowed down to 44 top priority candidates based on their likelihood of being effectors. These were examined by spatiotemporal gene expression profiling of infected hop. Among the highest in planta expressed CSEPs, five deletion mutants were tested in pathogenicity assays. A deletion mutant of VnaUn.279, a lethal pathotype specific gene with sequence similarity to SAM-dependent methyltransferase (LaeA), had lower infectivity and showed highly reduced virulence, but no changes in morphology, fungal growth or conidiation were observed. Several putative secreted effector proteins that probably contribute to V. nonalfalfae colonization of hop were identified in this study. Among them, LaeA gene homolog was found to act as a potential novel virulence effector of V. nonalfalfae. The combined results will serve for future characterization of V. nonalfalfae effectors, which will advance our understanding of Verticillium wilt disease.

AB  - Background: Thanks to specific adaptations developed over millions of years, the efficiency of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition of higher termite symbiotic system exceeds that of many other lignocellulose utilizing environments. Especially, the examination of its symbiotic microbes should reveal interesting carbohydrate-active enzymes, which are of primary interest for the industry. Previous metatranscriptomic reports (high-throughput mRNA sequencing) highlight the high representation and overexpression of cellulose and hemicelluloses degrading genes in the termite hindgut digestomes, indicating the potential of this technology in search for new enzymes. Nevertheless, several factors associated with the material sampling and library preparation steps make the metatranscriptomic studies of termite gut prokaryotic symbionts challenging. Methods: In this study, we first examined the influence of the sampling strategy, including the whole termite gut and luminal fluid, on the diversity and the metatranscriptomic profiles of the higher termite gut symbiotic bacteria. Secondly, we evaluated different commercially available kits combined in two library preparative pipelines for the best bacterial mRNA enrichment strategy. Results: We showed that the sampling strategy did not significantly impact the generated results, both in terms of the representation of the microbes and their transcriptomic profiles. Nevertheless collecting luminal fluid reduces the co-amplification of unwanted RNA species of host origin. Furthermore, for the four studied higher termite species, the library preparative pipeline employing Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit "Epidemiology" in combination with Poly(A) Purist MAG kit resulted in a more efficient rRNA and poly-A-mRNAdepletion (up to 98.44% rRNA removed) than the pipeline utilizing MICROBExpress and MICROBEnrich kits. High correlation of both Ribo-Zero and MICROBExpresse depleted gene expression profiles with total non-depleted RNA-seq data has been shown for all studied samples, indicating no systematic skewing of the studied pipelines. Conclusions: We have extensively evaluated the impact of the sampling strategy and library preparation steps on the metatranscriptomic profiles of the higher termite gut symbiotic bacteria. The presented methodological approach has great potential to enhance metatranscriptomic studies of the higher termite intestinal flora and to unravel novel carbohydrate-active enzymes.

AB  - Preparation of high-quality sequencing libraries is a costly and time-consuming component of metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). While the overall cost of sequencing has dropped significantly over recent years, the reagents needed to prepare sequencing samples are likely to become the dominant expense in the process. Furthermore, libraries prepared by hand are subject to human variability and needless waste due to limitations of manual pipetting volumes. Reduction of reaction volumes, combined with sub-microliter automated dispensing of reagents without consumable pipette tips, has the potential to provide significant advantages. Here, we describe the integration of several instruments, including the Labcyte Echo 525 acoustic liquid handler and the iSeq and NovaSeq Illumina sequencing platforms, to miniaturize and automate mNGS library preparation, significantly reducing the cost and the time required to prepare samples. Through the use of External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) spike-in RNAs, we demonstrated the fidelity of the miniaturized preparation to be equivalent to full volume reactions. Furthermore, detection of viral and microbial species from cell culture and patient samples was also maintained in the mini-aturized libraries. For 384-well mNGS library preparations, we achieved cost savings of over 80% in materials and reagents alone, and reduced preparation time by 90% compared to manual approaches, without compromising quality or representation within the library.

AB  - The development of haploid mammalian cell lines, coupled to next-generation sequencing, has recently facilitated forward genetic screenings in mammals. For mutagenesis, retrovirus- or transposon-based gene traps are frequently used. Current methods to map gene-trap insertions are based on inverse or splinkerette PCR, which despite their efficacy are prone to artifacts and do not provide information on expression of the targeted gene. Here, we describe a new RNA sequencing-based method (Trap(seq)) to map gene-trap insertions. By recognizing chimeric mRNAs containing gene-trap sequences spliced to an exon, our method identifies insertions that lead to productive trapping. When applied to individual mutant clones, our method provides a fast and cost-effective way that not only identifies the insertion site but also reveals its impact on the expression of the trapped gene. As proof of principle, we conducted two independent screenings for resistance against 6-thioguanine and an ATR inhibitor, which identified mutations known to provide resistance to these reagents and revealed ECT2 as a novel determinant for the sensitivity to ATR inhibition.

AB  - Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the causal agent of white stem rot, is responsible for significant losses in crop yields around the globe. While our understanding of S. sclerotiorum infection is becoming clearer, genetic control of the pathogen has been elusive and effective control of pathogen colonization using traditional broad-spectrum agro-chemical protocols are less effective than desired. In the current study, we developed species-specific RNA interference-based control treatments capable of reducing fungal infection. Development of a target identification pipeline using global RNA sequencing data for selection and application of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules identified single gene targets of the fungus. Using this approach, we demonstrate the utility of this technology through foliar applications of dsRNAs to the leaf surface that significantly decreased fungal infection and S. sclerotiorum disease symptoms. Select target gene homologs were also tested in the closely related species, Botrytis cinerea, reducing lesion size and providing compelling evidence of the adaptability and flexibility of this technology in protecting plants against devastating fungal pathogens.

AB  - Proteogenomics is a research area that combines areas as proteomics and genomics in a multi-omics setup using both mass spectrometry and high-throughput sequencing technologies. Currently, the main goals of the field are to aid genome annotation or to unravel the proteome complexity. Mass spectrometry based identifications of matching or homologues peptides can further refine gene models. Also, the identification of novel proteoforms is also made possible based on detection of novel translation initiation sites (cognate or near-cognate), novel transcript isoforms, sequence variation or novel (small) open reading frames in intergenic or un-translated genic regions by analyzing high-throughput sequencing data from RNAseq or ribosome profiling experiments. Other proteogenomics studies using a combination of proteomics and genomics techniques focus on antibody sequencing, the identification of immunogenic peptides or venom peptides. Over the years, a growing amount of bioinformatics tools and databases became available to help streamlining these cross-omics studies. Some of these solutions only help in specific steps of the proteogenomics studies, e.g. building custom sequence databases (based on next generation sequencing output) for mass spectrometry fragmentation spectrum matching. Over the last few years a handful integrative tools also became available that can execute complete proteogenomics analyses. Some of these are presented as stand-alone solutions, whereas others are implemented in a web-based framework such as Galaxy. In this review we aimed at sketching a comprehensive overview of all the bioinformatics solutions that are available for this growing research area. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background Familial Ebstein anomaly is a rare form of congenital heart disease. We report 7 individuals among 2 generations of 1 family with Ebstein anomaly. This family was first reported in 1991 by Balaji et al in which family members were also reported to have a mild skeletal phenotype. The most likely mechanism of inheritance was concluded to be autosomal dominant. We sought to identify the genetic pathogenesis in this family using a next generation sequencing approach. Methods and Results Whole exome sequencing was performed in 2 cousins in this family using the Agilent SureSelect Human all Exon 51 Mb version 5 capture kit. Data were processed through an analytic in-house pipeline. Whole exome sequencing identified a missense mutation in FLNA (Filamin A), an actin-binding protein located at Xq28, mutations in which are associated with the skeletal phenotypes Frontometaphyseal dysplasia, Otopalatodigital, and Melnick-Needles syndrome, with X-linked periventricular nodular heterotopia and FG syndrome (Omim, 305450). Review of the phenotypes of those with the mutation in this family shows increased severity of the cardiac phenotype and associated skeletal features in affected males, consistent with X-linked inheritance. Conclusions Although congenital heart disease is reported in families with mutations in FLNA, this is the first report of individuals being affected by Ebstein anomaly because of a mutation in this gene and details the concurrent skeletal phenotype observed in this family.

AB  - Over the last few years, RNA-seq has been used to study alterations in alternative splicing related to several diseases. Bioinformatics workflows used to perform these studies can be divided into two groups, those finding changes in the absolute isoform expression and those studying differential splicing. Many computational methods for transcriptomics analysis have been developed, evaluated and compared; however, there are not enough reports of systematic and objective assessment of processing pipelines as a whole. Moreover, comparative studies have been performed considering separately the changes in absolute or relative isoform expression levels. Consequently, no consensus exists about the best practices and appropriate workflows to analyse alternative and differential splicing. To assist the adequate pipeline choice, we present here a benchmarking of nine commonly used workflows to detect differential isoform expression and splicing. We evaluated the workflows performance over different experimental scenarios where changes in absolute and relative isoform expression occurred simultaneously. In addition, the effect of the number of isoforms per gene, and the magnitude of the expression change over pipeline performances were also evaluated. Our results suggest that workflow performance is influenced by the number of replicates per condition and the conditions heterogeneity. In general, workflows based on DESeq2, DEXSeq, Limma and NOISeq performed well over a wide range of transcriptomics experiments. In particular, we suggest the use of workflows based on Limma when high precision is required, and DESeq2 and DEXseq pipelines to prioritize sensitivity. When several replicates per condition are available, NOISeq and Limma pipelines are indicated.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) belong to a recently re-discovered species of RNA that emerge during RNA maturation through a process called back-splicing. A downstream 5' splice site is linked to an upstream 3' splice site to form a circular transcript instead of a canonical linear transcript. Recent advances in next -generation sequencing (NGS) have brought circRNAs back into the focus of many scientists. Since then, several studies reported that circRNAs are differentially expressed across tissue types and developmental stages, implying that they are actively regulated and not merely a by-product of splicing. Though functional studies have shown that some circRNAs could act as miRNA-sponges, the function of most circRNAs remains unknown. To expand our understanding of possible roles of circular RNAs, we propose a new pipeline that could fully characterizes candidate circRNA structure from RNAseq data FUCHS: FUll CHaracterization of circular RNA using RNA -Sequencing. Currently, most computational prediction pipelines use back -spliced reads to identify circular RNAs. FUCHS extends this concept by considering all RNA-seq information from long reads (typically >150 bp) to learn more about the exon coverage, the number of double break point fragments, the different circular isoforms arising from one host -gene, and the alternatively spliced exons within the same circRNA boundaries. This new knowledge will enable the user to carry out differential motif enrichment and miRNA seed analysis to determine potential regulators during circRNA biogenesis. FUCHS is an easy-to-use Python based pipeline that contributes a new aspect to the circRNA research.

AB  - Since its first use in plants in 2007, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has generated a vast amount of data for both model and nonmodel species. Organellar transcriptomes, however, are virtually always overlooked at the data analysis step. We therefore developed ChloroSeq, a bioinformatic pipeline aimed at facilitating the systematic analysis of chloroplast RNA metabolism, and we provide here a step-by--step user's manual. Following the alignment of quality-controlled data to the genome of interest, ChloroSeq measures genome expression level along with splicing and RNA editing efficiencies. When used in combination with the Tuxedo suite (TopHat and Cufflinks), ChloroSeq allows the simultaneous analysis of organellar and nuclear transcriptomes, opening the way to a better understanding of nucleus-organelle cross talk. We also describe the use of R commands to produce publication-quality figures based on ChloroSeq outputs. The effectiveness of the pipeline is illustrated through analysis of an RNA-Seq dataset covering the transition from growth to maturation to senescence of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves.

AB  - Background: The plastid acquisition by secondary endosymbiosis is a driving force for the algal evolution, and the comparative genomics was required to examine the genomic change of symbiont. Therefore, we established a pipeline of a de novo assembly of middle-sized genomes at a low cost and with high quality using long and short reads. Results: We sequenced symbiotic algae Chlorella variabilis using Oxfofrd Nanopore MinION as the long-read sequencer and Illumina HiSeq 4000 as the short-read sequencer and then assembled the genomes under various conditions. Subsequently, we evaluated these assemblies by the gene model quality and RNA-seq mapping rate. We found that long-read only assembly could not be suitable for the comparative genomics studies, but with short reads, we could obtain the acceptable assembly. On the basis of this result, we established the pipeline of de novo assembly for middle-sized algal genome using MinION. Conclusions: The genomic change during the early stages of plastid acquisition can now be revealed by sequencing and comparing many algal genomes. Moreover, this pipeline offers a solution for the assembly of various middle-sized eukaryotic genomes with high-quality and ease.

AB  - Background: Gene-fusion or chimeric transcripts have been implicated in the onset and progression of a variety of cancers. Massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the cellular transcriptome is a promising approach for the identification of chimeric transcripts of potential functional significance. We report here the development and use of an integrated computational pipeline for the de novo assembly and characterization of chimeric transcripts in 55 primary breast cancer and normal tissue samples. Methods: An integrated computational pipeline was employed to screen the transcriptome of breast cancer and control tissues for high-quality RNA-sequencing reads. Reads were de novo assembled into contigs followed by reference genome mapping. Chimeric transcripts were detected, filtered and characterized using our R-SAP algorithm. The relative abundance of reads was used to estimate levels of gene expression. Results: De novo assembly allowed for the accurate detection of 1959 chimeric transcripts to nucleotide level resolution and facilitated detailed molecular characterization and quantitative analysis. A number of the chimeric transcripts are of potential functional significance including 79 novel fusion-protein transcripts and many chimeric transcripts with alterations in their un-translated leader regions. A number of chimeric transcripts in the cancer samples mapped to genomic regions devoid of any known genes. Several 'pro-neoplastic' fusions comprised of genes previously implicated in cancer are expressed at low levels in normal tissues but at high levels in cancer tissues. Conclusions: Collectively, our results underscore the utility of deep sequencing technologies and improved bioinformatics workflows to uncover novel and potentially significant chimeric transcripts in cancer and normal somatic tissues.

AB  - Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and chromosome conformation capture (3C) analysis have led to the development of Hi-C, a genome-wide version of the 3C method. Hi-C has identified new levels of chromosome organization such as A/B compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs) as well as large megadomains on the inactive X chromosome, while allowing the identification of chromatin loops at the genome scale. Despite its powerfulness, Hi-C data analysis is much more involved compared to conventional NGS applications such as RNA-seq or ChIP-seq and requires many more steps. This presents a significant hurdle for those who wish to implement Hi-C technology into their laboratory. On the other hand, genomics data repository sites sometimes contain processed Hi-C data sets, allowing researchers to perform further analysis without the need for high-spec workstations and servers. In this chapter, we provide a detailed description on how to calculate A/B compartment profiles from processed Hi-C data on the autosomes and the active/inactive X chromosomes.

AB  - Central nervous system tumors are the leading cause of cancer related death in children. Despite much progress in the field of pediatric neurooncology, modern combination treatment regimens often result in significant late effects, such as neurocognitive deficits, endocrine dysfunction, secondary malignancies, and a host of other chronic health problems. Precision medicine strategies applied to pediatric neurooncology target specific characteristics of individual patients' tumors to achieve maximal killing of neoplastic cells while minimizing unwanted adverse effects. Here, we review emerging trends and the current literature that have guided the development of new molecularly based classification schemas, promising diagnostic techniques, targeted therapies, and delivery platforms for the treatment of pediatric central nervous system tumors.

AB  - Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL) is a lethal, and the most common, neoplastic complication of celiac disease. Here, we defined the genetic landscape of EATL through whole-exome sequencing of 69 EATL tumors. SETD2 was the most frequently silenced gene in EATL (32% of cases). The JAK-STAT pathway was the most frequently mutated pathway, with frequent mutations in STAT5B as well as JAK1, JAK3, STAT3, and SOCS1. We also identified mutations in KRAS, TP53, and TERT. Type I EATL and type II EATL (monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T cell lymphoma) had highly overlapping genetic alterations indicating shared mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis. We modeled the effects of SETD2 loss in vivo by developing a T cell-specific knockout mouse. These mice manifested an expansion of gamma delta T cells, indicating novel roles for SETD2 in T cell development and lymphomagenesis. Our data render the most comprehensive genetic portrait yet of this uncommon but lethal disease and may inform future classification schemes.

AB  - Next-Generation Sequencing has made available substantial amounts of large-scale Omics data, providing unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological systems. Specifically, the value of RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data has been confirmed in inferring how gene regulatory systems will respond under various conditions (bulk data) or cell types (single-cell data). RNA-Seq can generate genome-scale gene expression profiles that can be further analyzed using correlation analysis, co-expression analysis, clustering, differential gene expression (DGE), among many other studies. While these analyses can provide invaluable information related to gene expression, integration and interpretation of the results can prove challenging. Here we present a tool called IRIS-EDA, which is a Shiny web server for expression data analysis. It provides a straightforward and user-friendly platform for performing numerous computational analyses on user-provided RNA-Seq or Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. Specifically, three commonly used R packages (edgeR, DESeq2, and limma) are implemented in the DGE analysis with seven unique experimental design functionalities, including a user-specified design matrix option. Seven discovery-driven methods and tools (correlation analysis, heatmap, clustering, biclustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)) are provided for gene expression exploration which is useful for designing experimental hypotheses and determining key factors for comprehensive DGE analysis. Furthermore, this platform integrates seven visualization tools in a highly interactive manner, for improved interpretation of the analyses. It is noteworthy that, for the first time, IRIS-EDA provides a framework to expedite submission of data and results to NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) Data Principles. IRIS-EDA is freely available at http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/IRIS/.

AB  - Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a very valuable resource to understand the evolutionary history of poorly known species. However, in organisms with large genomes, as most amphibians, WGS is still excessively challenging and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) represents a cost-effective tool to explore genome-wide variability. Non-model organisms do not usually have a reference genome and the transcriptome must be assembled de-novo. Weused RNA-seq to obtain the transcriptomic profile for Oreobates cruralis, a poorly known South American direct-developing frog. In total, 550,871 transcripts were assembled, corresponding to 422,999 putative genes. Of those, we identified 23,500, 37,349, 38,120 and 45,885 genes present in the Pfam, EggNOG, KEGG and GO databases, respectively. Interestingly, our results suggested that genes related to immune system and defense mechanisms are abundant in the transcriptome of O. cruralis. We also present a pipeline to assist with pre-processing, assembling, evaluating and functionally annotating a de-novo transcriptome from RNA-seq data of non-model organisms. Our pipeline guides the inexperienced user in an intuitive way through all the necessary steps to build de-novo transcriptome assemblies using readily available software and is freely available at: https://github. com/biomendi/TRANSCRIPTOMEASSEMBLY- PIPELINE/wiki.

AB  - Communication and nutrition are major drivers of fitness in ants. While communication is paramount to colony cohesion, nutrition is decisive in regulating reproductive division of labor among colony members. However, neither of these has been studied from a molecular perspective in developing individuals. Here, we report the availability of the first transcriptome resources for larvae of the ant Formica fusca, a species with excellent discrimination abilities and thus the potential to become a model system for studying molecular mechanisms of communication. We generated a comprehensive, high-coverage RNA-seq data set using Illumina RNA-seq technology by sequencing 24 individual 1st - 2nd instar larvae collected from four experimental groups (6 samples per treatment, 49 million mean reads per sample, coverage between 194-253x). A total of 24,765 unigenes were generated using a combination of genome-guided and de novo transcriptome assembly. A comprehensive assembly pipeline and annotation lists are provided. This dataset adds valuable transcriptomic resources for further study of developmental gene expression, transcriptional regulation and functional gene activity in ant larvae.

AB  - In female mammals, one X chromosome is transcriptionally inactivated (XCI), leading to dosage compensation between sexes, fundamental for embryo viability. A previous study using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data proposed that female human preimplantation embryos achieve dosage compensation by downregulating both Xs, a phenomenon named dampening of X expression. Using a novel pipeline on those data, we identified a decrease in the proportion of biallelically expressed X-linked genes during development, consistent with XCI. Moreover, we show that while the expression sum of biallelically expressed X-linked genes decreases with embryonic development, their median expression remains constant, rejecting the hypothesis of X dampening. In addition, analyses of a different dataset of scRNA-seq suggest the appearance of X-linked monoallelic expression by the late blastocyst stage in females, another hallmark of initiation of XCI. Finally, we addressed the issue of dosage compensation between the single active X and autosomes in males and females for the first time during human preimplantation development, showing emergence of X to autosome dosage compensation by the upregulation of the active X chromosome in both male and female embryonic stem cells. Our results show compelling evidence of an early process of X chromosome inactivation during human preimplantation development.

AB  - Microbiota plays an important role in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tract. Understanding the variations of the commensal microbiota composition is crucial for a more efficient control of enteric infectious diseases and for the reduction of the use of antibiotics in animal production, which are the main points of interest for improved animal healthcare and welfare and for consumer health protection. Even though the intestinal microbiota has been extensively studied, little is known about the gastric microbiota. This pilot study was aimed at a descriptive analysis of the gastric microbiota in healthy pigs and at the identification of any differences among four potentially distinct microbial niches in the stomach. Gastric mucosal samples from the oxyntic area, the pylorus and the gastric groove, and a sample of gastric contents were collected from four healthy weaned pigs. Bacterial DNA was isolated and extracted from each sample and amplicons from the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced using Ion Torrent PGM. The data were analysed by an "unsupervised" and a "supervised" approach in the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) pipeline. Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all the samples. Differences in bacterial community composition were found between mucosal and content samples (one-way ANOSIM pairwise post hoc test, p < 0.05); instead, the different mucosal regions did not show differences between them. The mucosal samples were characterised by Herbiconiux and Brevundimonas, two genera which include cellulolytic and xylanolytic strains. Nevertheless, additional larger trials are needed to support the data presented in this pilot study and to increase the knowledge regarding the resident microbiota of the stomach.

AB  - Background: Transcriptomic approaches (microarray and RNA-seq) have been a tremendous advance for molecular science in all disciplines, but they have made interpretation of hypothesis testing more difficult because of the large number of comparisons that are done within an experiment. The result has been a proliferation of techniques aimed at solving the multiple comparisons problem, techniques that have focused primarily on minimizing Type I error with little or no concern about concomitant increases in Type II errors. We have previously proposed a novel approach for setting statistical thresholds with applications for high throughput omics-data, optimal alpha, which minimizes the probability of making either error (i.e. Type I or II) and eliminates the need for post-hoc adjustments. Results: A meta-analysis of 242 microarray studies extracted from the peer-reviewed literature found that current practices for setting statistical thresholds led to very high Type II error rates. Further, we demonstrate that applying the optimal alpha approach results in error rates as low or lower than error rates obtained when using (i) no post-hoc adjustment, (ii) a Bonferroni adjustment and (iii) a false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment which is widely used in transcriptome studies. Conclusions: We conclude that optimal alpha can reduce error rates associated with transcripts in both microarray and RNA-seq experiments, but point out that improved statistical techniques alone cannot solve the problems associated with high throughput datasets - these approaches need to be coupled with improved experimental design that considers larger sample sizes and/or greater study replication.

AB  - Discordant phenotypes and diseases in Monozygotic twins (MZ) are always intriguing and genetics is the exclusive reason. Down syndrome is one such disorder, which shows heterogeneity, with occurrences of incidental diseases discordant between cases. When such disease discordance is noted in Down syndromic MZ twins, it becomes a true genetic case and the necessity to uncover the pathogenic variants becomes imperative. One such case of MZ twins reported by an earlier study failed to identify the pathogenic variants behind the discordance between Congenital Heart Defect (CHD) and Epilepsy. In the current study, using the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) datasets of the original investigators along with our custom variant identification pipeline, we investigated the consequences of damaging novel and rare discordant mutations in TGFBR2, for CHD; ITPR1 and RYR2 for Epilepsy. TGFBR2 was identified with a frameshift deletion resulting in a stop gain mutation and appeared to be dominant in function causing Ventricular Septal Defect in the older Down syndrome twin, while nonsynonymous heterozygous substitutions was identified in ITPR1 and RYR2, causing epileptic seizures in the younger twin. Pathway analysis on mutant genes revealed disruption of several processes such as vascular septal formation for TGFBR2, and calcium signalling for ITPR1 and RYR2. The present investigation identified novel discordant mutations relevant to the discordant disease presented, using appropriate analysis and pipelines.

AB  - BackgroundTargeted resequencing has become the most used and cost-effective approach for identifying causative mutations of Mendelian diseases both for diagnostics and research purposes. Due to very rapid technological progress, NGS laboratories are expanding their capabilities to address the increasing number of analyses. Several open source tools are available to build a generic variant calling pipeline, but a tool able to simultaneously execute multiple analyses, organize, and categorize the samples is still missing.ResultsHere we describe VarGenius, a Linux based command line software able to execute customizable pipelines for the analysis of multiple targeted resequencing data using parallel computing. VarGenius provides a database to store the output of the analysis (calling quality statistics, variant annotations, internal allelic variant frequencies) and sample information (personal data, genotypes, phenotypes). VarGenius can also perform the joint analysis of hundreds of samples with a single command, drastically reducing the time for the configuration and execution of the analysis.VarGenius executes the standard pipeline of the Genome Analysis Tool-Kit (GATK) best practices (GBP) for germinal variant calling, annotates the variants using Annovar, and generates a user-friendly output displaying the results through a web page.VarGenius has been tested on a parallel computing cluster with 52 machines with 120GB of RAM each. Under this configuration, a 50M whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis for a family was executed in about 7h (trio or quartet); a joint analysis of 30 WES in about 24h and the parallel analysis of 34 single samples from a 1M panel in about 2h.ConclusionsWe developed VarGenius, a master tool that faces the increasing demand of heterogeneous NGS analyses and allows maximum flexibility for downstream analyses. It paves the way to a different kind of analysis, centered on cohorts rather than on singleton. Patient and variant information are stored into the database and any output file can be accessed programmatically. VarGenius can be used for routine analyses by biomedical researchers with basic Linux skills providing additional flexibility for computational biologists to develop their own algorithms for the comparison and analysis of data.The software is freely available at: https://github.com/frankMusacchia/VarGenius

AB  - Purpose: Congenital anomalies and intellectual disability (CA/ID) are a major diagnostic challenge in medical genetics-50% of patients still have no molecular diagnosis after a long and stressful diagnostic "odyssey." Solo clinical whole-exome sequencing (WES) was applied in our genetics center to improve diagnosis in patients with CA/ID. Methods: This retrospective study examined 416 consecutive tests performed over 3 years to demonstrate the effectiveness of periodically reanalyzing WES data. The raw data from each nonpositive test was reanalyzed at 12 months with the most recent pipeline and in the light of new data in the literature. The results of the reanalysis for patients enrolled in the third year are not yet available. Results: Of the 416 patients included, data for 156 without a diagnosis were reanalyzed. We obtained 24 (15.4%) additional diagnoses: 12 through the usual diagnostic process (7 new publications, 4 initially misclassified, and 1 copy-number variant), and 12 through translational research by international data sharing. The final yield of positive results was 27.9% through a strict diagnostic approach, and 2.9% through an additional research strategy. Conclusion: This article highlights the effectiveness of periodically combining diagnostic reinterpretation of clinical WES data with translational research involving data sharing for candidate genes.

AB  - Tree species of the genus Eucalyptus are the most valuable and widely planted hardwoods in the world. Given the economic importance of Eucalyptus trees, much effort has been made towards the generation of specimens with superior forestry properties that can deliver high-quality feedstocks, customized to the industrys needs for both cellulosic (paper) and lignocellulosic biomass production. In line with these efforts, large sets of molecular data have been generated by several scientific groups, providing invaluable information that can be applied in the development of improved specimens. In order to fully explore the potential of available datasets, the development of a public database that provides integrated access to genomic and transcriptomic data from Eucalyptus is needed. EUCANEXT is a database that analyses and integrates publicly available Eucalyptus molecular data, such as the E. grandis genome assembly and predicted genes, ESTs from several species and digital gene expression from 26 RNA-Seq libraries. The database has been implemented in a Fedora Linux machine running MySQL and Apache, while Perl CGI was used for the web interfaces. EUCANEXT provides a user-friendly web interface for easy access and analysis of publicly available molecular data from Eucalyptus species. This integrated database allows for complex searches by gene name, keyword or sequence similarity and is publicly accessible at http://www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/eucalyptusdb. Through EUCANEXT, users can perform complex analysis to identify genes related traits of interest using RNA-Seq libraries and tools for differential expression analysis. Moreover, all the bioinformatics pipeline here described, including the database schema and PERL scripts, are readily available and can be applied to any genomic and transcriptomic project, regardless of the organism.

AB  - Transcription factor programming of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has emerged as an approach to generate human neurons for disease modeling. However, programming schemes produce a variety of cell types, and those neurons that are made often retain an immature phenotype, which limits their utility in modeling neuronal processes, including synaptic transmission. We report that combining NGN2 programming with SMAD and WNT inhibition generates human patterned induced neurons (hpiNs). Single-cell analyses showed that hpiN cultures contained cells along a developmental continuum, ranging from poorly differentiated neuronal progenitors to well-differentiated, excitatory glutamatergic neurons. The most differentiated neurons could be identified using a CAMK2A::GFP reporter gene and exhibited greater functionality, including NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission. We conclude that utilizing single-cell and reporter gene approaches for selecting successfully programmed cells for study will greatly enhance the utility of hpiNs and other programmed neuronal populations in the modeling of nervous system disorders.

AB  - Background: Advances in next-generation DNA sequencing technologies are now enabling detailed characterization of sequence variations in cancer genomes. With whole-genome sequencing, variations in coding and non-coding sequences can be discovered. But the cost associated with it is currently limiting its general use in research. Whole-exome sequencing is used to characterize sequence variations in coding regions, but the cost associated with capture reagents and biases in capture rate limit its full use in research. Additional limitations include uncertainty in assigning the functional significance of the mutations when these mutations are observed in the non-coding region or in genes that are not expressed in cancer tissue. Results: We investigated the feasibility of uncovering mutations from expressed genes using RNA sequencing datasets with a method called Variant Detection in RNA(VaDiR) that integrates 3 variant callers, namely: SNPiR, RVBoost, and MuTect2. The combination of all 3 methods, which we called Tier 1 variants, produced the highest precision with true positive mutations from RNA-seq that could be validated at the DNA level. We also found that the integration of Tier 1 variants with those called by MuTect2 and SNPiR produced the highest recall with acceptable precision. Finally, we observed a higher rate of mutation discovery in genes that are expressed at higher levels. Conclusions: Our method, VaDiR, provides a possibility of uncovering mutations from RNA sequencing datasets that could be useful in further functional analysis. In addition, our approach allows orthogonal validation of DNA-based mutation discovery by providing complementary sequence variation analysis from paired RNA/DNA sequencing datasets.

AB  - The advent of next generation sequencing and bioinformatics tools have greatly advanced our knowledge about the phylogenetic diversity and ecological role of microbes inhabiting the mammalian gut. However, there is a lack of information on the evaluation of these computational tools in the context of the rumen microbiome as these programs have mostly been benchmarked on real or simulated datasets generated from human studies. In this study, we compared the outcomes of two methods, Kraken (mRNA based) and a pipeline developed in-house based on Mothur (16S rRNA based), to assess the taxonomic profiles (bacteria and archaea) of rumen microbial communities using total RNA sequencing of rumen fluid collected from 12 cattle with differing feed conversion ratios (FCR). Both approaches revealed a similar phyla distribution of the most abundant taxa, with Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria accounting for approximately 80% of total bacterial abundance. For bacterial taxa, although 69 genera were commonly detected by both methods, an additional 159 genera were exclusively identified by Kraken. Kraken detected 423 species, while Mothur was not able to assign bacterial sequences to the species level. For archaea, both methods generated similar results only for the abundance of Methanomassiliicoccaceae (previously referred as RCC), which comprised more than 65% of the total archaeal families. Taxon R4-41B was exclusively identified by Mothur in the rumen of feed efficient bulls, whereas Kraken uniquely identified Methanococcaceae in inefficient bulls. Although Kraken enhanced the microbial classification at the species level, identification of bacteria or archaea in the rumen is limited due to a lack of reference genomes for the rumen microbiome. The findings from this study suggest that the development of the combined pipelines using Mothur and Kraken is needed for a more inclusive and representative classification of microbiomes.

AB  - Background: Integrating rare variation from trio family and case-control studies has successfully implicated specific genes contributing to risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), developmental disorders (DDs), and epilepsy (EPI). For schizophrenia (SCZ), however, while sets of genes have been implicated through the study of rare variation, only two risk genes have been identified. Methods: We used hierarchical Bayesian modeling of rare-variant genetic architecture to estimate mean effect sizes and risk-gene proportions, analyzing the largest available collection of whole exome sequence data for SCZ (1,077 trios, 6,699 cases, and 13,028 controls), and data for four NDDs (ASD, ID, DD, and EPI; total 10,792 trios, and 4,058 cases and controls). Results: For SCZ, we estimate there are 1,551 risk genes. There are more risk genes and they have weaker effects than for NDDs. We provide power analyses to predict the number of risk-gene discoveries as more data become available. We confirm and augment prior risk gene and gene set enrichment results for SCZ and NDDs. In particular, we detected 98 new DD risk genes at FDR < 0.05. Correlations of risk-gene posterior probabilities are high across four NDDs (rho > 0.55), but low between SCZ and the NDDs (rho < 0.3). An in-depth analysis of 288 NDD genes shows there is highly significant protein-protein interaction (PPI) network connectivity, and functionally distinct PPI subnetworks based on pathway enrichment, single-cell RNA-seq cell types, and multi-region developmental brain RNA-seq. Conclusions: We have extended a pipeline used in ASD studies and applied it to infer rare genetic parameters for SCZ and four NDDs (https://github.com/hoangtn/extTADA). We find many new DD risk genes, supported by gene set enrichment and PPI network connectivity analyses. We find greater similarity among NDDs than between NDDs and SCZ. NDD gene subnetworks are implicated in postnatally expressed presynaptic and postsynaptic genes, and for transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation in prenatal neural progenitor and stem cells.

AB  - Motivation: A key component in many RNA-Seq-based studies is contrasting multiple replicates from different experimental conditions. In this setup, replicates play a key role as they allow to capture underlying biological variability inherent to the compared conditions, as well as experimental variability. However, what constitutes a 'bad' replicate is not necessarily well defined. Consequently, researchers might discard valuable data or downstream analysis may be hampered by failed experiments. Results: Here we develop a probability model to weigh a given RNA-Seq sample as a representative of an experimental condition when performing alternative splicing analysis. We demonstrate that this model detects outlier samples which are consistently and significantly different compared with other samples from the same condition. Moreover, we show that instead of discarding such samples the proposed weighting scheme can be used to downweight samples and specific splicing variations suspected as outliers, gaining statistical power. These weights can then be used for differential splicing (DS) analysis, where the resulting algorithm offers a generalization of the MAJIQ algorithm. Using both synthetic and real-life data, we perform an extensive evaluation of the improved MAJIQ algorithm in different scenarios involving perturbed samples, mislabeled samples, same condition groups, and different levels of coverage, showing it compares favorably to other tools. Overall, this work offers an outlier detection algorithm that can be combined with any splicing pipeline, a generalized and improved version of MAJIQ for DS detection, and evaluation metrics with matching code and data for DS algorithms.

AB  - Paternal contributions to the zygote are thought to extend beyond delivery of the genome and paternal RNAs have been linked to epigenetic transgenerational inheritance in different species. In addition, sperm-egg fusion activates several downstream processes that contribute to zygote formation, including PLC zeta-mediated egg activation and maternal RNA clearance. Since a third of the preimplantation developmental period in the mouse occurs prior to the first cleavage stage, there is ample time for paternal RNAs or their encoded proteins potentially to interact and participate in early zygotic activities. To investigate this possibility, a bespoke next-generation RNA sequencing pipeline was employed for the first time to characterise and compare transcripts obtained from isolated murine sperm, MII eggs and pre-cleavage stage zygotes. Gene network analysis was then employed to identify potential interactions between paternally and maternally derived factors during the murine egg-to-zygote transition involving RNA clearance, protein clearance and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Our in silico approach looked for factors in sperm, eggs and zygotes that could potentially interact co-operatively and synergistically during zygote formation. At least five sperm RNAs (Hdac11, Fbxo2, Map1lc3a, Pcbp4 and Zfp821) met these requirements for a paternal contribution, which with complementary maternal co-factors suggest a wider potential for extra-genomic paternal involvement in the developing zygote.

AB  - In gene expression profile, data analysis pipeline is categorized into four levels, major downstream tasks, i.e., (1) identification of differential expression; (2) clustering co-expression patterns; (3) classification of subtypes of samples; and (4) detection of genetic regulatory networks, are performed posterior to preprocessing procedure such as normalization techniques. To be more specific, temporal dynamic gene expression data has its inherent feature, namely, two neighboring time points (previous and current state) are highly correlated with each other, compared to static expression data which samples are assumed as independent individuals. In this chapter, we demonstrate how HMMs and hierarchical Bayesian modeling methods capture the horizontal time dependency structures in time series expression profiles by focusing on the identification of differential expression. In addition, those differential expression genes and transcript variant isoforms over time detected in core prerequisite steps can be generally further applied in detection of genetic regulatory networks to comprehensively uncover dynamic repertoires in the aspects of system biology as the coupled framework.

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) are transcripts generally longer than 200 nucleotides with no or poor protein coding potential, and most of their functions are also poorly characterized. Recently, an increasing number of studies have shown that IncRNAs can be involved in various critical biological processes such as organism development or cancer progression. Little, however, is known about their effects in helminths parasites, such as Schistosoma mansoni. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify and characterize IncRNAs from RNA-seq data with high confidence from S. mansoni adult worms. Through the utilization of different criteria such as genome localization, exon number, gene length, and stability, we identified 170 new putative IncRNAs. All novel S. mansoni IncRNAs have no conserved synteny including human and mouse, These closest protein coding genes were enriched in 10 significant Gene Ontology terms related to metabolism, transport, and biosynthesis. Fifteen putative IncRNAs showed differential expression, and three displayed sex-specific differential expressions in praziquantel sensitive and resistant adult worm couples. Together, our method can predict a set of novel IncRNAs from the RNA-seq data. Some IncRNAs are shown to be differentially expressed suggesting that those novel IncRNAs can be given high priority in further functional studies focused on praziquantel resistance.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been proposed as a suitable tool for liquid biopsy in colorectal cancer (CRC), although most studies to date have focused almost exclusively on sequencing of panels of potential clinically actionable genes. We evaluated the clinical value of whole-exome sequencing (WES) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in plasma, with the goal of identifying differential clinical profiles in patients with CRC. To this end, we applied an original concept, "differential presence of exons" (DPE). We determined differences in levels of 379 exons in plasma cfDNA and used DPE analysis to cluster and classify patients with disseminated and localized disease. The resultant bioinformatics analysis pipeline allowed us to design a predictive DPE algorithm in a small subset of patients that could not be initially classified based on the selection criteria. This DPE suggests that these nucleic acids could be actively released by both tumor and nontumor cells as a means of intercellular communication and might thus play a role in the process of malignant transformation. DPE is a new technique for the study of plasma cfDNA by WES that might have predictive and prognostic value in patients with CRC.

AB  - Cis- and trans-regulatory mutations are important contributors to transcriptome evolution. Quantifying their relative contributions to intraspecific variation in gene expression is essential for understanding the population genetic processes that underlie evolutionary changes in gene expression. Here, we have examined this issue by quantifying genome-wide, allele-specific expression (ASE) variation using a crossing scheme that produces F-1 hybrids between 18 different Drosophila melanogaster strains sampled from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel and a reference strain from another population. Head and body samples from F1 adult females were subjected to RNA sequencing and the subsequent ASE quantification. Cis- and trans-regulatory effects on expression variation were estimated from these data. A higher proportion of genes showed significant cis-regulatory variation (similar to 28%) than those that showed significant trans-regulatory variation (similar to 9%). The sizes of cis-regulatory effects on expression variation were 1.98 and 1.88 times larger than trans-regulatory effects in heads and bodies, respectively. A generalized linear model analysis revealed that both cis- and trans-regulated expression variation was strongly associated with nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity and tissue specificity. Interestingly, trans-regulated variation showed a negative correlation with local recombination rate. Also, our analysis on proximal transposable element (TE) insertions suggested that they affect transcription levels of ovary-expressed genes more pronouncedly than genes not expressed in the ovary, possibly due to defense mechanisms against TE mobility in the germline. Collectively, our detailed quantification of ASE variations from a natural population has revealed a number of new relationships between genomic factors and the effects of cis- and trans-regulatory factors on expression variation.

AB  - Recent technological advances have increased the throughput of proteomics, facilitating the characterization of molecular phenotypes on the population level, thus bearing the potential to complement transcriptomic analyses. Reference protein databases are crucial for the analysis and quantification, because only peptides in the protein database can be identified. Any peptide carrying an amino acid variant cannot be identified. Because most proteomic studies, even of natural populations, do not account for polymorphisms, we analysed the influence of variant peptides on quantitative proteomic analyses. We used transcriptomic and proteomic data of two Drosophila melanogaster genotypes and identified genotype-specific variants from RNA-seq data. We introduce a simple pipeline to include these variants in a polymorphism-aware protein database and compared the results to an unmodified reference database. The polymorphism-aware database not only identifies more peptides, but the quantitative values also changed when peptide variants were included. We conclude that proteomic quantification is likely to be biased, in particular for small genes, when polymorphisms are being ignored. Polymorphism-aware databases may be therefore a key step towards improved proteomic data analyses, especially for the analysis of pooled individuals and the comparison of population samples.

AB  - BackgroundResistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been linked to local immunosuppression independent of major ICI targets (e.g., PD-1). Clinical experience with response prediction based on PD-L1 expression suggests that other factors influence sensitivity to ICIs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.MethodsTumor specimens from 120 NSCLC patients from 10 institutions were evaluated for PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, and global proliferative profile by targeted RNA-seq.ResultsCell proliferation, derived from the mean expression of 10 proliferation-associated genes (namely BUB1, CCNB2, CDK1, CDKN3, FOXM1, KIAA0101, MAD2L1, MELK, MKI67, and TOP2A), was identified as a marker of response to ICIs in NSCLC. Poorly, moderately, and highly proliferative tumors were somewhat equally represented in NSCLC, with tumors with the highest PD-L1 expression being more frequently moderately proliferative as compared to lesser levels of PD-L1 expression. Proliferation status had an impact on survival in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. There was a significant survival advantage for moderately proliferative tumors compared to their combined highly/poorly counterparts (p=0.021). Moderately proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors had a median survival of 14.6months that was almost twice that of PD-L1 negative highly/poorly proliferative at 7.6months (p=0.028). Median survival in moderately proliferative PD-L1 negative tumors at 12.6months was comparable to that of highly/poorly proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors at 11.5months, but in both instances less than that of moderately proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors. Similar to survival, proliferation status has impact on disease control (DC) in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. Patients with moderately versus those with poorly or highly proliferative tumors have a superior DC rate when combined with any classification schema used to score PD-L1 as a positive result (i.e., TPS50% or1%), and best displayed by a DC rate for moderately proliferative tumors of no less than 40% for any classification of PD-L1 as a negative result. While there is an over representation of moderately proliferative tumors as PD-L1 expression increases this does not account for the improved survival or higher disease control rates seen in PD-L1 negative tumors.ConclusionsCell proliferation is potentially a new biomarker of response to ICIs in NSCLC and is applicable to PD-L1 negative tumors.

In particular gene fusion detection and comprehension have been deeply enhanced by these methods. However, state of the art algorithms for gene fusion identification are still challenging. Indeed, they identify huge amounts of poorly overlapping candidates and all the reported fusions should be considered for in lab validation clearly overwhelming wet lab capabilities. Results: In this work we propose a novel methodological approach and tool named FuGePrior for the prioritization of gene fusions from paired-end RNA-Seq data. The proposed pipeline combines state of the art tools for chimeric transcript discovery and prioritization, a series of filtering and processing steps designed by considering modern literature on gene fusions and an analysis on functional reliability of gene fusion structure. Conclusions: FuGePrior performance has been assessed on two publicly available paired-end RNA-Seq datasets: The first by Edgren and colleagues includes four breast cancer cell lines and a normal breast sample, whereas the second by Ren and colleagues comprises fourteen primary prostate cancer samples and their paired normal counterparts. FuGePrior results accounted for a reduction in the number of fusions output of chimeric transcript discovery tools that ranges from 65 to 75% depending on the considered breast cancer cell line and from 37 to 65% according to the prostate cancer sample under examination. Furthermore, since both datasets come with a partial validation we were able to assess the performance of FuGePrior in correctly prioritizing real gene fusions. Specifically, 25 out of 26 validated fusions in breast cancer dataset have been correctly labelled as reliable and biologically significant. Similarly, 2 out of 5 validated fusions in prostate dataset have been recognized as priority by FuGePrior tool.

AB  - Background: Transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) related applications allow for rapid explorations due to their high-throughput and relatively fast experimental capabilities, providing unprecedented progress in gene functional annotation, gene regulation analysis, and environmental factor verification. However, with increasing amounts of sequenced reads and reference model species, the selection of appropriate reference species for gene annotation has become a new challenge. Methods: We proposed a novel approach for finding the most effective reference model species through taxonomic associations and ultra-conserved orthologous (UCO) gene comparisons among species. An online system for multiple species selection (MSS) for RNA-seq differential expression analysis was developed, and comprehensive genomic annotations from 291 reference model eukaryotic species were retrieved from the RefSeq, KEGG, and UniProt databases. Results: Using the proposed MSS pipeline, gene ontology and biological pathway enrichment analysis can be efficiently achieved, especially in the case of transcriptomic analysis of non-model organisms. The results showed that the proposed method solved problems related to limitations in annotation information and provided a roughly twenty-fold reduction in computational time, resulting in more accurate results than those of traditional approaches of using a single model reference species or the large non-redundant reference database. Conclusions: Selection of appropriate reference model species helps to reduce missing annotation information, allowing for more comprehensive results than those obtained with a single model reference species. In addition, adequate model species selection reduces the computational time significantly while retaining the same order of accuracy. The proposed system indeed provides superior performance by selecting appropriate multiple species for transcriptomic analysis compared to traditional approaches.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in human cancers. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that both 5p-arm and 3p-arm of mature miRNAs could be expressed from the same precursor and we further interrogated the 5p-arm and 3p-arm miRNA expression with a comprehensive arm feature annotation list. To assist biologists to visualize the differential 5p-arm and 3p-arm miRNA expression patterns, we utilized a user-friendly mobile App to display. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) miRNA-Seq expression information. We have collected over 4,500 miRNA-Seq datasets from 15 TCGA cancer types and further processed them with the 5p-arm and 3p-arm annotation analysis pipeline. In order to be displayed with the RNA-Seq Viewer App, annotated 5p-arm and 3p-arm miRNA expression information and miRNA gene loci information were converted into SQLite tables. In this distinct application, for any given miRNA gene, 5p-arm miRNA is illustrated on the top of chromosome ideogram and 3p-arm miRNA is illustrated on the bottom of chromosome ideogram. Users can then easily interrogate the differentially 5p-arm/3p-arm expressed miRNAs with their mobile devices. This study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of RNA-Seq Viewer App in addition to mRNA-Seq data visualization.

AB  - Asthma is a common, under-diagnosed disease affecting all ages. We sought to identify a nasal brush-based classifier of mild/moderate asthma. 190 subjects with mild/moderate asthma and controls underwent nasal brushing and RNA sequencing of nasal samples. A machine learning-based pipeline identified an asthma classifier consisting of 90 genes interpreted via an L2-regularized logistic regression classification model. This classifier performed with strong predictive value and sensitivity across eight test sets, including (1) a test set of independent asthmatic and control subjects profiled by RNA sequencing (positive and negative predictive values of 1.00 and 0.96, respectively; AUC of 0.994), (2) two independent case-control cohorts of asthma profiled by microarray, and (3) five cohorts with other respiratory conditions (allergic rhinitis, upper respiratory infection, cystic fibrosis, smoking), where the classifier had a low to zero misclassification rate. Following validation in large, prospective cohorts, this classifier could be developed into a nasal biomarker of asthma.

AB  - The interest in investigating the biological roles of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) is increasing, due to the pleiotropic effects of these molecules exert in many biological contexts. While several methods and tools are available to study microRNAs (miRNAs), only few focus on novel classes of sncRNAs, in particular PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). To overcome these limitations, we implemented iSmaRT (integrative Small RNA Tool-kit), an automated pipeline to analyze smallRNA-Seq data.

AB  - Tench, Tinca tinca is a freshwater species which receives increasing attention as marine resources are over-exploited and alternative feed components must be implemented to enable sustainable development of aquaculture. The aim of the study was to provide scientists and fish farmers with first high quality annotated tench transcriptome and open a new chapter in tench research, especially when practical diets are tested. Therefore, the second aim was to identify differentially expressed contigs (DECs) in tench gut after 86-day trial where adult tench females were fed with 0% and 100% replacement of fish meal (FM) with poultry by-product meal (PBM). De novo assembling using de novo RNA-Seq Assembly Pipeline (DRAP) produced 64070 contigs where these exceeding 1 kbp were mostly annotated. Microsatellite search identified 23668 SSRs and SNPs were distributed in 118002 transitions and 83577 transversions. High quality of the assembly and annotation completeness of the tench transcriptome was confirmed using BUSCO and by mapping contigs against common carp, Cyprinus carpio and zebrafish, Danio rerio data sets. Analysis of gene expression differences between gut samples tench fed with FM and PBM diets revealed 721 and 69 DECs using edgeR and DESeq2, respectively. Venn diagram for these results filtered out 57 DECs which were common for both analysis. Due to a low number of annotated DECs enrichment analysis provided a low number of useful contigs for pathway or functional analysis. Nevertheless, each contig in the set was analysed through BLASTn and BLASTx and eighteen DECs were characterised and identified as mainly involved in response to different immune stimuli and disease states (e.g. cluster of differentiation 48, F-type lectin), cell adhesion (e.g. paracingulin), digestion (e.g. serine proteases) and signal transduction (e.g. neurexophilin 3, complexin 2). Moreover, study has shown that most of the identified in our study DECs (70.2%) were down regulated in gut samples of tench fed with PBM comparing to these with FM-based feed. This observation might indicate on disorganization of inter-epithelial junctions in ongoing inflammation process. Our de novo tench gut transcriptome assembly (online NGS Pipeline) provide a guide for further diverse studies because, understanding feed-gut interactions and intestinal homeostasis in farmed tench is important to maximise performance of this species and to ensure that freshwater aquaculture continues to be a sustainable source of food for a growing world population.

AB  - Recent advances in molecular biology allow the quantification of the transcriptome and scoring transcripts as differentially or equally expressed between two biological conditions. Although these two tasks are closely linked, the available inference methods treat them separately: a primary model is used to estimate expression and its output is post processed by using a differential expression model. In the paper, both issues are simultaneously addressed by proposing the joint estimation of expression levels and differential expression: the unknown relative abundance of each transcript can either be equal or not between two conditions. A hierarchical Bayesian model builds on the BitSeq framework and the posterior distribution of transcript expression and differential expression is inferred by using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. It is shown that the model proposed enjoys conjugacy for fixed dimension variables; thus the full conditional distributions are analytically derived. Two samplers are constructed, a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler and a collapsed Gibbs sampler, and the latter is found to perform better. A cluster representation of the aligned reads to the transcriptome is introduced, allowing parallel estimation of the marginal posterior distribution of subsets of transcripts under reasonable computing time. Under a fixed prior probability of differential expression the clusterwise sampler has the same marginal posterior distributions as the raw sampler, but a more general prior structure is also employed. The algorithm proposed is benchmarked against alternative methods by using synthetic data sets and applied to real RNA sequencing data. Source code is available on line from https://github.com/mqbssppe/cjBitSeq.

AB  - Background: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments typically analyze hundreds or thousands of cells after amplification of the cDNA. The high throughput is made possible by the early introduction of sample-specific bar codes (BCs), and the amplification bias is alleviated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Thus, the ideal analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data needs to efficiently tabulate reads according to both BC and UMI. Findings: zUMIs is a pipeline that can handle both known and random BCs and also efficiently collapse UMIs, either just for exon mapping reads or for both exon and intron mapping reads. If BC annotation is missing, zUMIs can accurately detect intact cells from the distribution of sequencing reads. Another unique feature of zUMIs is the adaptive downsampling function that facilitates dealing with hugely varying library sizes but also allows the user to evaluate whether the library has been sequenced to saturation. To illustrate the utility of zUMIs, we analyzed a single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset and show that more than 35% of all reads map to introns. Also, we show that these intronic reads are informative about expression levels, significantly increasing the number of detected genes and improving the cluster resolution. Conclusions: zUMIs flexibility makes if possible to accommodate data generated with any of the major scRNA-seq protocols that use BCs and UMIs and is the most feature-rich, fast, and user-friendly pipeline to process such scRNA-seq data.

AB  - IntroductionThe accurate prediction and annotation of gene structures from the genome sequence of an organism enable genome-wide functional analyses to obtain insight into the biological properties of an organism.ObjectivesWe recently developed a highly accurate filamentous fungal gene prediction pipeline and web platform called TaF. TaF is a homology-based gene predictor employing large-scale taxonomic profiling to search for close relatives in genome queries.MethodsTaF pipeline consists of four processing steps; (1) taxonomic profiling to search for close relatives to query, (2) generation of hints for determining exon-intron boundaries from orthologous protein sequence data of the profiled species, (3) gene prediction by combination of ab inito and evidence-based prediction methods, and (4) homology search for gene models.ResultsTaF generates extrinsic evidence that suggests possible exon-intron boundaries based on orthologous protein sequence data, thus reducing false-positive predictions of gene structure based on distantly related orthologs data. In particular, the gene prediction method using taxonomic profiling shows very high accuracy, including high sensitivity and specificity for gene models, suggesting a new approach for homology-based gene prediction from newly sequenced or uncharacterized fungal genomes, with the potential to improve the quality of gene prediction.ConclusionTaF will be a useful tool for fungal genome-wide analyses, including the identification of targeted genes associated with a trait, transcriptome profiling, comparative genomics, and evolutionary analysis.

AB  - Background Tobacco is smoked in different form including cigarettes and water pipes. One popular form of water pipe smoking especially in Middle Eastern countries is shisha smoking. Shisha has been associated with various diseases including oral cancer. However, genomic alterations and gene expression changes associated with chronic shisha exposure have not been previously investigated. Objectives Whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling of immortalized human oral keratinocytes (OKF6/TERT1) cells chronically treated with 0.5% shisha extract for a period of 8 months was undertaken to characterize molecular alterations associated with shisha exposure. Methods Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and preprocessed as per manufacturer's instruction and subjected to whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. Exome was analyzed using GATK pipeline whereas RNA-Seq data was analyzed using HiSat2 and HTSeq along with DESeq to elucidate differentially expressed genes. Results Whole-exome sequence analysis led to identification of 521 somatic missense variants corresponding to 389 genes RNA-Seq data revealed 247 differentially expressed genes (>= 2-fold, P-value<0.01) in shisha treated cells compared to parental cells. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that interferon-signaling pathway was significantly affected. We predict activation of MAPK1 pathway which is known to play a key role in oral cancer. We also observed allele specific expression of mutant LIMA1 based on RNA-Seq dataset. Conclusion Our findings provide insights into genomic alterations and gene expression pattern associated with oral keratinocytes chronically exposed to shisha.

AB  - Background: Although ultrahigh-throughput RNA-Sequencing has become the dominant technology for genomewide transcriptional profiling, the vast majority of RNA-Seq studies typically profile only tens of samples, and most analytical pipelines are optimized for these smaller studies. However, projects are generating ever-larger data sets comprising RNA-Seq data from hundreds or thousands of samples, often collected at multiple centers and from diverse tissues. These complex data sets present significant analytical challenges due to batch and tissue effects, but provide the opportunity to revisit the assumptions and methods that we use to preprocess, normalize, and filter RNA-Seq data -critical first steps for any subsequent analysis. Results: We find that analysis of large RNA-Seq data sets requires both careful quality control and the need to account for sparsity due to the heterogeneity intrinsic in multi-group studies. We developed Yet Another RNA Normalization software pipeline (YARN), that includes quality control and preprocessing, gene filtering, and normalization steps designed to facilitate downstream analysis of large, heterogeneous RNA-Seq data sets and we demonstrate its use with data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Conclusions: An R package instantiating YARN is available at http://bioconductor. org/packages/yarn.

AB  - Background: The usual analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads is based on an existing reference genome and annotated gene models. However, when a reference for the sequenced species is not available, alternatives include using a reference genome from a related species or reconstructing transcript sequences with de novo assembly. In addition, researchers are faced with many options for RNA-seq data processing and limited information on how their decisions will impact the final outcome. Using both a diploid and polyploid species with a distant reference genome, we have tested the influence of different tools at various steps of a typical RNA-seq analysis workflow on the recovery of useful processed data available for downstream analysis. Findings: At the preprocessing step, we found error correction has a strong influence on de novo assembly but not on mapping results. After trimming, a greater percentage of reads could be used in downstream analysis by selecting gentle quality trimming performed with Skewer instead of strict quality trimming with Trimmomatic. This availability of reads correlated with size, quality, and completeness of de novo assemblies and with number of mapped reads. When selecting a reference genome from a related species to map reads, outcome was significantly improved when using mapping software tolerant of greater sequence divergence, such as Stampy or GSNAP. Conclusions: The selection of bioinformatic software tools for RNA-seq data analysis can maximize quality parameters on de novo assemblies and availability of reads in downstream analysis.

AB  - Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that can be classified into multiple subtypes based on the tumor transcriptome. Most of the subtyping schemes used in clinics today are derived from analyses of microarray data from thousands of different tumors together with clinical data for the patients from which the tumors were isolated. However, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is gradually replacing microarrays as the preferred transcriptomics platform, and although transcript abundances measured by the two different technologies are largely compatible, subtyping methods developed for probe-based microarray data are incompatible with RNA-Seq as input data. Here, we present an RNA-Seq data processing pipeline, which relies on the mapping of sequencing reads to the probe set target sequences instead of the human reference genome, thereby enabling probe-based subtyping of breast cancer tumor tissue using sequencing-based transcriptomics. By analyzing 66 breast cancer tumors for which gene expression was measured using both microarrays and RNA-Seq, we show that RNA-Seq data can be directly compared to microarray data using our pipeline. Additionally, we demonstrate that the established subtyping method CITBCMST (Guedj et al., ), which relies on a 375 probe set-signature to classify samples into the six subtypes basL, lumA, lumB, lumC, mApo, and normL, can be applied without further modifications. This pipeline enables a seamless transition to sequencing-based transcriptomics for future clinical purposes.

AB  - Background: Salinity is a major abiotic stress that limits upland cotton growth and reduces fibre production worldwide. To reveal genetic regulation via transcript and protein levels after salt stress, we comprehensively analysed the global chancres in mRNA, miRNA, and protein profiles in response to salt stress in two contrasting salt-tolerant cotton genotypes. Results: In the current study, proteomic and mRNA-seq data were combined to reveal that some genes are differentially expressed at both the proteomic and mRNA levels. However, we observed no significant change in mRNA corresponding to most of the strongly differentially abundant proteins. This finding may have resulted from global changes in alternative splicing events and miRNA levels under salt stress conditions. Evidence was provided indicating that several salt stress-responsive proteins can alter miRNAs and modulate alternative splicing events in upland cotton. The results of the stringent screening of the mRNA-seq and proteomic data between the salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive genotypes identified 63 and 85 candidate genes/proteins related to salt tolerance after 4 and 24 h of salt stress, respectively, between the tolerant and sensitive genotype. Finally, we predicted an interaction network comprising 158 genes/proteins and then discovered that two main clusters in the network were composed of ATP synthase (CotAD_74681) and cytochrome oxidase (CotAD_46197) in mitochondria. The results revealed that mitochondria, as important organelles involved in energy metabolism, play an essential role in the synthesis of resistance proteins during the process of salt exposure. Conclusion: We provided a plausible schematic for the systematic salt tolerance model; this schematic reveals multiple levels of gene regulation in response to salt stress in cotton and provides a list of salt tolerance-related genes/proteins. The information here will facilitate candidate gene discovery and molecular marker development for salt tolerance breeding in cotton.

AB  - A major goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the role of adaptive processes on sensory systems. Visual capabilities are strongly influenced by environmental and ecological conditions, and the evolutionary advantages of vision are manifest by its complexity and ubiquity throughout Metazoa. Crustaceans occupy a vast array of habitats and ecological niches, and are thus ideal taxa to investigate the evolution of visual systems. A comparative approach is taken here for efficient identification and classification of opsin genes, photoreceptive pigment proteins involved in color vision, focusing on two crustacean model organisms:Hyalella azteca and Daphnia pulex. Transcriptomes of both species were assembled de novo to elucidate the diversity and function of expressed opsins within a robust phylogenetic context. For this purpose, we developed a modified version of the Phylogenetically Informed Annotation tool's pipeline to filter and identify visual genes from transcriptomes in a scalable and efficient manner. In addition, reference genomes of these species were used to validate our pipeline while characterizing the genomic architecture of the opsin genes. Next-generation sequencing and phylogenetics provide future venues for the study of sensory systems, adaptation, and evolution in model and nonmodel organisms.

AB  - The current classification of melanocytic tumors includes clinical, pathological, and molecular data. A subset of lesions remains difficult to classify according to these complex multilayer schemes. We report two cases of deeply infiltrating melanomas with a sclerosing background. The first case occurred on the back of a middle-aged man appearing clinically as a dermatofibroma. The architectural and cytological aspects resembled those of a desmoplastic melanoma but the strong expression of both melanA and HMB45, two stainings usually reported as negative in this entity, raised the question of an alternate diagnosis. The second case was a large, slowly growing, perivulvar tumor in a middle-aged woman. The morphology was complex with a central junctional spitzoid pattern associating an epidermal hyperplasia with large nests of large spindled melanocytes. The dermal component was made of deeply invasive strands and nests of nevoid unpigmented melanocytes surrounded by fibrosis; a perineural invasion was present at the periphery of the lesion. In both cases, aCGH found, among many other anomalies, a chromosomal breakpoint at the BRAF locus. RNA sequencing identified in both an AKAP9-BRAF gene fusion. A complementary resection was performed and no relapses have been observed in the respectively 15 and 6 months of follow-up. Both of these melanomas remained unclassified. We further review the variety of melanocytic tumors associated with such BRAF fusions.

AB  - Background: Orthology characterizes genes of different organisms that arose from a single ancestral gene via speciation, in contrast to paralogy, which is assigned to genes that arose via gene duplication. An accurate orthology assignment is a crucial step for comparative genomic studies. Orthologous genes in two organisms can be identified by applying a so-called reciprocal search strategy, given that complete information of the organisms' gene repertoire is available. In many investigations, however, only a fraction of the gene content of the organisms under study is examined (e.g., RNA sequencing). Here, identification of orthologous nucleotide or amino acid sequences can be achieved using a graph-based approach that maps nucleotide sequences to genes of known orthology. Existing implementations of this approach, however, suffer from algorithmic issues that may cause problems in downstream analyses. Results: We present a new software pipeline, Orthograph, that addresses and solves the above problems and implements useful features for a wide range of comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses. Orthograph applies a best reciprocal hit search strategy using profile hidden Markov models and maps nucleotide sequences to the globally best matching cluster of orthologous genes, thus enabling researchers to conveniently and reliably delineate orthologs and paralogs from transcriptomic and genomic sequence data. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on de novo-sequenced and assembled transcript libraries of 24 species of apoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) as well as on published genomic datasets. Conclusion: With Orthograph, we implemented a best reciprocal hit approach to reference-based orthology prediction for coding nucleotide sequences such as RNAseq data. Orthograph is flexible, easy to use, open source and freely available at https://mptrsen. github. io/Orthograph. Additionally, we release 24 de novo-sequenced and assembled transcript libraries of apoid wasp species.

AB  - RNA viruses are abundant infectious agents and present in all domains of life. Arthropods, including ticks, are well known as vectors of many viruses of concern for human and animal health. Despite their obvious importance, the extent and structure of viral diversity in ticks is still poorly understood, particularly in Europe. Using a bulk RNA-sequencing approach that captures the complete transcriptome, we analysed the virome of the most common tick in Europe - Ixodes ricinus. In total, RNA sequencing was performed on six libraries consisting of 33 I. ricinus nymphs and adults sampled in Norway. Despite the small number of animals surveyed, our virus identification pipeline revealed nine diverse and novel viral species, phylogenetically positioned within four different viral groups bunyaviruses, luteoviruses, mononegavirales and partitiviruses - and sometimes characterized by extensive genetic diversity including a potentially novel genus of bunyaviruses. This work sheds new light on the virus diversity in I. ricinus, expands our knowledge of potential host/vector-associations and tick-transmitted viruses within several viral groups, and pushes the latitudinal limit where it is likely to find tick-associated viruses. Notably, our phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of tick-specific virus clades that span multiple continents, highlighting the role of ticks as important virus reservoirs.

AB  - Recent single-cell RNA-seq protocols based on droplet microfluidics use massively multiplexed barcoding to enable simultaneous measurements of transcriptomes for thousands of individual cells. The increasing complexity of such data creates challenges for subsequent computational processing and troubleshooting of these experiments, with few software options currently available. Here, we describe a flexible pipeline for processing droplet-based transcriptome data that implements barcode corrections, classification of cell quality, and diagnostic information about the droplet libraries. We introduce advanced methods for correcting composition bias and sequencing errors affecting cellular and molecular barcodes to provide more accurate estimates of molecular counts in individual cells.

AB  - Background. O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status is a predictive biomarker in glioblastoma patients. Glioblastoma without hypermethylated MGMT promoter is largely resistant to treatment with temozolomide. These patients are in particular need of new treatment approaches, which are offered by biomarker-driven clinical trials with targeted drugs based on molecular characterization of individual tumors. Methods. In preparation for an upcoming clinical study, a comprehensive molecular profiling approach was undertaken on tissues from 43 glioblastoma patients harboring an unmethylated MGMT promoter at diagnosis. The diagnostic pipeline covered various levels of molecular characteristics, including whole-exome sequencing, low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, as well as microarray-based gene expression profiling and DNA methylation arrays. Results. Complex multilayer molecular diagnostics were feasible in this setting with a median turnaround time of 4-5 weeks from surgery to the molecular tumor board. In 35% of cases, potentially relevant therapeutic decisions were derived from the data. Alterations were most frequently found in receptor tyrosine kinases, members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway as well as cell cycle control and p53 regulation cascades. Individual tumors harbored clonal alterations such as oncogenic fusions of tyrosine kinases which constitute promising targets for targeted therapies. A prioritization algorithm is proposed to allocate patients with multiple targets to the potentially best treatment option. Conclusion. With this feasibility study, a comprehensive molecular profiling approach for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma harboring an unmethylated MGMT promoter is presented. Analyses in this pilot cohort serve as a basis for trials based on targetable alterations and on the question of allocation of patients to the best treatment arm.

AB  - The classification of neurons into distinct types is an ongoing effort aimed at revealing and understanding the diversity of the components of the nervous system. Recently available methods allow us to determine the gene expression pattern of individual neurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex to generate powerful categorization schemes. For a thorough understanding of neuronal diversity such genetic categorization schemes need to be combined with traditional classification parameters like position, axonal projection or response properties to sensory stimulation. Here we describe a method to link the gene expression of individual neurons with their position, axonal projection, or sensory response properties. Neurons are labeled in vivo based on their anatomical or functional properties and, using patch clamp pipettes, their RNA individually harvested in vitro for RNAseq. We validate the methodology using multiple established molecularly and anatomically distinct cell populations and explore molecular differences between uncharacterized neurons in mouse visual cortex. Gene expression patterns between L5 neurons projecting to frontal or contralateral cortex are distinct while L2 neurons differing in position, projection, or function are molecularly similar. With this method we can determine the genetic expression pattern of functionally and anatomically identified individual neurons.

We describe an experimental protocol and bioinformatics pipeline for functional identification of EBV true late genes, the last step of transcription prior to virion packaging and egress. All data have been uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession code GSE96689.

AB  - The identification of reproducible signals from the results of replicate high-throughput experiments is an important part of modern biological research. Often little is known about the dependence structure and the marginal distribution of the data, motivating the development of a nonparametric approach to assess reproducibility. The procedure, which we call the maximum rank reproducibility (MaRR) procedure, uses a maximum rank statistic to parse reproducible signals from noise without making assumptions about the distribution of reproducible signals. Because it uses the rank scale this procedure can be easily applied to a variety of data types. One application is to assess the reproducibility of RNA-seq technology using data produced by the sequencing quality control (SEQC) consortium, which coordinated a multi-laboratory effort to assess reproducibility across three RNA-seq platforms. Our results on simulations and SEQC data show that the MaRR procedure effectively controls false discovery rates, has desirable power properties, and compares well to existing methods. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB  - TAL1/SCL is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). TAL1 and its regulatory partners (GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB) positively regulate each other and coordinately regulate the expression of their downstream target genes in T-ALL cells. However, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulated by these factors are largely unknown. Here we established a bioinformatics pipeline and analyzed RNA-seq datasets with deep coverage to identify lncRNAs regulated by TAL1 in T-ALL cells. Our analysis predicted 57 putative lncRNAs that are activated by TAL1. Many of these transcripts were regulated by GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB in a coordinated manner. We identified two novel transcripts that were activated in multiple T-ALL cell samples but were downregulated in normal thymocytes. One transcript near the ARID5B gene locus was specifically expressed in TAL1 -positive T-ALL cases. The other transcript located between the FAM49A and MYCN gene locus was also expressed in normal hematopoietic stem cells and T-cell progenitor cells. In addition, we identified a subset of lncRNAs that were negatively regulated by TAL1 and positively regulated by E-proteins in T-ALL cells. This included a known lncRNA (lnc-OAZ3-2:7) located near the RORC gene, which was expressed in normal thymocytes but repressed in TAL1 -positive T-ALL cells.

AB  - Background: RNA editing is a co-transcriptional modification that increases the molecular diversity, alters secondary structure and protein coding sequences by changing the sequence of transcripts. The most common RNA editing modification is the single base substitution (A -> I) that is catalyzed by the members of the Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) family. Typically, editing sites are identified as RNA-DNA-differences (RDDs) in a comparison of genome and transcriptome data from next-generation sequencing experiments. However, a method for robust detection of site-specific editing events from replicate RNA-seq data has not been published so far. Even more surprising, condition-specific editing events, which would show up as differences in RNA-RNA comparisons (RRDs) and depend on particular cellular states, are rarely discussed in the literature. Results: We present JACUSA, a versatile one-stop solution to detect single nucleotide variant positions from comparing RNA-DNA and/or RNA-RNA sequencing samples. The performance of JACUSA has been carefully evaluated and compared to other variant callers in an in silico benchmark. JACUSA outperforms other algorithms in terms of the F measure, which combines precision and recall, in all benchmark scenarios. This performance margin is highest for the RNA-RNA comparison scenario. We further validated JACUSA's performance by testing its ability to detect A -> I events using sequencing data from a human cell culture experiment and publicly available RNA-seq data from Drosophila melanogaster heads. To this end, we performed whole genome and RNA sequencing of HEK-293 cells on samples with lowered activity of candidate RNA editing enzymes. JACUSA has a higher recall and comparable precision for detecting true editing sites in RDD comparisons of HEK-293 data. Intriguingly, JACUSA captures most A -> I events from RRD comparisons of RNA sequencing data derived from Drosophila and HEK-293 data sets. Conclusion: Our software JACUSA detects single nucleotide variants by comparing data from next-generation sequencing experiments (RNA-DNA or RNA-RNA). In practice, JACUSA shows higher recall and comparable precision in detecting A -> I sites from RNA-DNA comparisons, while showing higher precision and recall in RNA-RNA comparisons.

AB  - Purpose Patients with cancer who graciously consent for autopsy represent an invaluable resource for the study of cancer biology. To advance the study of tumor evolution, metastases, and resistance to treatment, we developed a next-generation rapid autopsy program integrated within a broader precision medicine clinical trial that interrogates pre- and postmortem tissue samples for patients of all ages and cancer types. Materials and Methods One hundred twenty-three (22%) of 554 patients who consented to the clinical trial also consented for rapid autopsy. This report comprises the first 15 autopsies, including patients with metastatic carcinoma (n = 10), melanoma (n = 1), and glioma (n = 4). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on frozen autopsy tumor samples from multiple anatomic sites and on non-neoplastic tissue. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on a subset of frozen samples. Tissue was also used for the development of preclinical models, including tumor organoids and patient-derived xenografts. Results Three hundred forty-six frozen samples were procured in total. WES was performed on 113 samples and RNA-Seq on 72 samples. Successful cell strain, tumor organoid, and/or patient-derived xenograft development was achieved in four samples, including an inoperable pediatric glioma. WES data were used to assess clonal evolution and molecular heterogeneity of tumors in individual patients. Mutational profiles of primary tumors and metastases yielded candidate mediators of metastatic spread and organotropism including CUL9 and PIGM in metastatic ependymoma and ANKRD52 in metastatic melanomato the lung. RNA-Seqdata identified novel gene fusion candidates. Conclusion A next-generation sequencing-based autopsy program in conjunction with a pre-mortem precision medicine pipeline for diverse tumors affords a valuable window into clonal evolution, metastasis, and alterations underlying treatment. Moreover, such an autopsy program yields robust preclinical models of disease. (C) 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

AB  - Background: The field of small RNA is one of the most investigated research areas since they were shown to regulate transposable elements and gene expression and play essential roles in fundamental biological processes. Small RNA deep sequencing (sRNA-seq) is now routinely used for large-scale analyses of small RNA. Such high-throughput sequencing typically produces several millions reads. Results: Here we present a computational pipeline (sRNAPipe: small RNA pipeline) based on the Galaxy framework that takes as input a fastq file of small RNA-seq reads and performs successive steps of mapping to categories of genomic sequences: transposable elements, gene transcripts, microRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs. It also provides individual mapping and counting for chromosomes, transposable elements and gene transcripts, normalization, small RNA length analysis and plotting of the data along genomic coordinates to build publication-quality graphs and figures. sRNAPipe evaluates 10-nucleotide 5'-overlaps of reads on opposite strands to test ping-pong amplification for putative PIWI-interacting RNAs, providing counts of overlaps and corresponding z-scores. Conclusions: sRNAPipe is easy to use and does not require command-line or coding knowledge. This pipeline gives quick visual and quantitative results, which are usable for publications. sRNAPipe is freely available as a Galaxy tool and via GitHub.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Dual anti-HER2 blockade increased the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in the Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimisation (NeoALTTO) trial, and high immune gene expression was associated with pCR in all treatment arms. So far, no marker has been identified that is specifically associated with the benefit from dual HER2 blockade. OBJECTIVE To examine if use of the T-cell beta chain variable genes adds to the potential association of immune gene signatures with response to dual HER2 blockade. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In the NeoALTTO trial, HER2-positive patients recruited between January 5, 2008, and May 27, 2010, were treated with paclitaxel plus either lapatinib or trastuzumab or both as neoadjuvant therapy. In this study, RNA sequencing data from baseline tumor specimens of 245 patients in the NeoALTTO trial were analyzed and reads were aligned to TRBV gene reference sequences using a previously published Basic Local Alignment Search Tool T-cell receptor mapping pipeline. Total TRBV gene use, Shannon entropy, and gene richness were calculated for each tumor, and nonnegative matrix factorization was used to define TRBV co-use metagenes (TMGs). The association between TRBV metrics, tumor genomic metrics, and response was assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Statistical analysis was performed from January 23 to December 2, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The association between TRBV use metrics and pCR. RESULTS Among the 245 women with available data (mean [SD] age, 49 [11] years), total TRBV use correlated positively with a gene expression signature for immune activity (Spearman rho = 0.93; P < .001). High use of TRBV11-3 and TMG2, characterized by high use of TRBV4.3, TRBV6.3, and TRBV7.2, was associated with a higher rate of pCR to dual HER2-targeted therapy (TRBV11-3 interaction: odds ratio, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.22-6.47]; P = .02; TMG2 interaction: odds ratio, 3.39 [95% CI, 1.57-8.27]; P = .004). Immune-rich cancers with high TMG2 levels (n = 92) had significantly better response to dual HER2-targeted treatment compared with the single therapy arms (rate of pCR, 68% [95% CI, 52%-83%] vs 21% [95% CI, 10%-31%]; P < .001), whereas those with low TMG2 levels did not benefit from dual therapy. High TMG2 levels were also associated with a higher rate of pCR to the combined therapy in immune-poor tumors (n = 30; pCR, 50% [95% CI, 22%-78%) vs 6% [95% CI, 0%-16%]; P = .009). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use patterns of TRBV genes potentially provide information about the association with response to dual HER2 blockade beyond immune gene signatures. High use of TRBV11.3 or TRBV4.3. TRB V6.3, and TRBV7.2 identifies patients who have a better response to dual HER2 targeted therapy.

AB  - Complementing genome sequence with deep transcriptome and proteome data could enable more accurate assembly and annotation of newly sequenced genomes. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept of an integrated approach for analysis of the genome and proteome of Anopheles stephensi, which is one of the most important vectors of the malaria parasite. To achieve broad coverage of genes, we carried out transcriptome sequencing and deep proteome profiling of multiple anatomically distinct sites. Based on transcriptomic data alone, we identified and corrected 535 events of incomplete genome assembly involving 1196 scaffolds and 868 protein-coding gene models. This proteogenomic approach enabled us to add 365 genes that were missed during genome annotation and identify 917 gene correction events through discovery of 151 novel exons, 297 protein extensions, 231 exon extensions,192 novel protein start sites,19 novel translational frames, 28 events of joining of exons, and 76 events of joining of adjacent genes as a single gene. Incorporation of proteomic evidence allowed us to change the designation of more than 87 predicted "noncoding RNAs" to conventional mRNAs coded by protein-coding genes. Importantly, extension of the newly corrected genome assemblies and gene models to 15 other newly assembled Anopheline genomes led to the discovery of a large number of apparent discrepancies in assembly and annotation of these genomes. Our data provide a framework for how future genome sequencing efforts should incorporate transcriptomic and proteomic analysis in combination with simultaneous manual curation to achieve near complete assembly and accurate annotation of genomes.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation is a cardiac disease driven by numerous idiopathic etiologies. NUP155 is a nuclear pore complex protein that has been identified as a clinical driver of atrial fibrillation, yet the precise mechanism is unknown. The present study employs a systems biology algorithm to identify effects of NUP155 disruption on cardiogenicity in a model of stem cell-derived differentiation. Methods: Embryonic stem (ES) cell lines (n = 5) with truncated NUP155 were cultured in parallel with wild type (WT) ES cells (n = 5), and then harvested for RNAseq. Samples were run on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Reads were analyzed using Strand NGS, Cytoscape, DAVID and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to deconvolute the NUP155-disrupted transcriptome. Network topological analysis identified key features that controlled framework architecture and functional enrichment. Results: In NUP155 truncated ES cells, significant expression changes were detected in 326 genes compared to WT. These genes segregated into clusters that enriched for specific gene ontologies. Deconvolution of the collective framework into discrete sub-networks identified a module with the highest score that enriched for Cardiovascular System Development, and revealed NTRK1/TRKA and SRSF2/SC35 as critical hubs within this cardiogenic module. Conclusions: The strategy of pluripotent transcriptome deconvolution used in the current study identified a novel association of NUP155 with potential drivers of arrhythmogenic AF. Here, NUP155 regulates cardioplasticity of a sub-network embedded within a larger framework of genome integrity, and exemplifies how transcriptome cardiogenicity in an embryonic stem cell genome is recalibrated by nucleoporin dysfunction.

AB  - BackgroundExisting tools for the aggregation and visualization of differential expression data have discrete functionality and require that end-users rely on multiple software packages with complex dependencies or manually manipulate data for analysis and interpretation. Furthermore, at present, data aggregation and visualization are laborious, time consuming, and subject to human error. This is a serious limitation on the current state of differential transcriptomic analysis, which makes it necessary to expend extensive time and resources to reach the point where biological meaning can be interpreted. Such an approach for analysis also leads to scattered and non-standardized code, unsystematic project management and non-reproducible result sets.ResultsHere, we present a differential expression analysis toolkit, DEvis, that provides a powerful, integrated solution for the analysis of differential expression data with a rapid turnaround time. DEvis has simple installation requirements and provides a convenient, user-friendly R package that addresses the issues inherent to complex multi-factor experiments, such as multiple contrast aggregation and integration, result sorting and selection, visualization, project management, and reproducibility. This tool increases the capabilities of differential expression analysis while reducing workload and the potential for manual error. Furthermore, it provides a much-needed encapsulation of scattered functionality, making large and complex analysis more efficient and reproducible.ConclusionDEvis provides a wide range of powerful visualization, data aggregation, and project management tools that provide flexibility and speed in analysis. The functionality provided by DEVis increases efficiency of analysis and supplies researchers with new and relevant means for the analysis of large and complicated transcriptomic experiments. DEvis furthermore incorporates automatic project management capabilities, which standardizes analysis and ensures the reproducibility of results. After the establishment of statistical frameworks that identify differentially expressed genes, this package is the next logical step for differential transcriptomic analysis, establishing the critical framework necessary to manipulate, explore, and extract biologically relevant meaning from differential expression data.

AB  - Background: RNA-seq is the most commonly used sequencing application. Not only does it measure gene expression but it is also an excellent media to detect important structural variants such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion (Indels) or fusion transcripts. However, detection of these variants is challenging and complex from RNA-seq. Here we describe a sensitive and accurate analytical pipeline which detects various mutations at once for translational precision medicine. Methods: The pipeline incorporates most sensitive aligners for Indels in RNA-Seq, the best practice for data preprocessing and variant calling, and STAR-fusion is for chimeric transcripts. Variants/mutations are annotated, and key genes can be extracted for further investigation and clinical actions. Three datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the pipeline for SNVs, indels and fusion transcripts. Results: For the well-defined variants from NA12878 by GIAB project, about 95% and 80% of sensitivities were obtained for SNVs and indels, respectively, in matching RNA-seq. Comparison with other variant specific tools showed good performance of the pipeline. For the lung cancer dataset with 41 known and oncogenic mutations, 39 were detected by the pipeline with STAR aligner and all by the GSNAP aligner. An actionable EML4 and ALK fusion was also detected in one of the tumors, which also demonstrated outlier ALK expression. For 9 fusions spiked-into RNA-seq libraries with different concentrations, the pipeline was able to detect all in unfiltered results although some at very low concentrations may be missed when filtering was applied. Conclusions: The new RNA-seq workflow is an accurate and comprehensive mutation profiler from RNA-seq. Key or actionable mutations are reliably detected from RNA-seq, which makes it a practical alternative source for personalized medicine.

AB  - Background: Since experimental elucidation of gene function is often laborious, various in silico methods have been developed to predict gene function of uncharacterized genes. Since functionally related genes are often expressed in the same tissues, conditions and developmental stages (co-expressed), functional annotation of characterized genes can be transferred to co-expressed genes lacking annotation. With genome-wide expression data available, the construction of co-expression networks, where genes are nodes and edges connect significantly co-expressed genes, provides unprecedented opportunities to predict gene function. However, the construction of such networks requires large volumes of high-quality data, multiple processing steps and a considerable amount of computation power. While efficient tools exist to process RNA-Seq data, pipelines which combine them to construct co-expression networks efficiently are currently lacking. Results: LSTrAP (Large-Scale Transcriptome Analysis Pipeline), presented here, combines all essential tools to construct co-expression networks based on RNA-Seq data into a single, efficient workflow. By supporting parallel computing on computer cluster infrastructure, processing hundreds of samples becomes feasible as shown here for Arabidopsis thaliana and Sorghum bicolor, which comprised 876 and 215 samples respectively. The former was used here to show how the quality control, included in LSTrAP, can detect spurious or low-quality samples. The latter was used to show how co-expression networks are able to group known photosynthesis genes and imply a role in this process of several, currently uncharacterized, genes. Conclusions: LSTrAP combines the most popular and performant methods to construct co-expression networks from RNA-Seq data into a single workflow. This allows large amounts of expression data, required to construct co-expression networks, to be processed efficiently and consistently across hundreds of samples. LSTrAP is implemented in Python 3.4 (or higher) and available under MIT license from https://github.molgen.mpg.de/proost/LSTrAP

AB  - A major aim of cancer genomics is to pinpoint which somatically mutated genes are involved in tumor initiation and progression. We introduce a new framework for uncovering cancer genes, differential mutation analysis, which compares the mutational profiles of genes across cancer genomes with their natural germline variation across healthy individuals. We present DiffMut, a fast and simple approach for differential mutational analysis, and demonstrate that it is more effective in discovering cancer genes than considerably more sophisticated approaches. We conclude that germline variation across healthy human genomes provides a powerful means for characterizing somatic mutation frequency and identifying cancer driver genes. DiffMut is available at https://github.com/Singh-Lab/Differential-Mutation-Analysis.

AB  - Background: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder affecting the ocular, skeletal and cardiovascular systems. Previous studies of MFS have demonstrated the association between genetic defects and clinical manifestations. Our purpose was to investigate the role of novel genetic variants in determining MFS clinical phenotypes. Methods: We sequenced the whole exome of 19 individuals derived from three Han Chinese families. The sequencing data were analyzed by a standard pipeline. Variants were further filtered against the public database and an in-house database. Then, we performed pedigree analysis under different inheritance patterns according to American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. Results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Two novel loss-of-function indels (c.5027_5028insTGTCCTCC, p.D1677Vfs*8; c.5856delG, p.S1953Lfs*27) and one nonsense variant (c.8034C>A, p.Y2678*) of FBN1 were identified in Family 1, Family 2 and Family 3, respectively. All affected members carried pathogenic mutations, whereas other unaffected family members or control individuals did not. These different kinds of loss of function (LOF) variants of FBN1 were located in the cbEGF region and a conserved domain across species and were not reported previously. Conclusions: Our study extended and strengthened the vital role of FBN1 LOF mutations in the pathogenesis of MFS with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. We confirm that genetic testing by next-generation sequencing of blood DNA can be fundamental in helping clinicians conduct mutation-based pre- and postnatal screening, genetic diagnosis and clinical management for MFS.

AB  - As a revolutionary technology for life sciences, RNA-seq has many applications and the computation pipeline has also many variations. Here, we describe a protocol to perform RNA-seq data analysis where the aim is to identify differentially expressed genes in comparisons of two conditions. The protocol follows the recently published RNA-seq data analysis best practice and applies quality checkpoints throughout the analysis to ensure reliable data interpretation. It is written to help new RNA-seq users to understand the basic steps necessary to analyze an RNA-seq dataset properly. An extension of the protocol has been implemented as automated workflows in the R package ezRun, available also in the data analysis framework SUSHI, for reliable, repeatable, and easily interpretable analysis results.

AB  - Elucidating the mechanistic underpinnings of genetic associations with complex traits requires formally characterizing and testing associated cell and tissue-specific expression profiles. New opportunities exist to bolster this investigation with the growing numbers of large publicly available omics level data resources. Herein, we describe a fully likelihood-based strategy to leveraging external resources in the setting that expression profiles are partially or fully unobserved in a genetic association study. A general framework is presented to accommodate multiple data types, and strategies for implementation using existing software packages are described. The method is applied to an investigation of the genetics of evoked inflammatory response in cardiovascular disease research. Simulation studies suggest appropriate type-1 error control and power gains compared to single regression imputation, the most commonly applied practice in this setting.

AB  - Alternative first exons diversify the transcriptomes of eukaryotes by producing variants of the 5' Untranslated Regions (5 UTRs) and N-terminal coding sequences. Accurate transcriptome-wide detection of alternative first exons typically requires specialized experimental approaches that are designed to identify the 5' ends of transcripts. We developed a computational pipeline SEASTAR that identifies first exons from RNA-seq data alone then quantifies and compares alternative first exon usage across multiple biological conditions. The exons inferred by SEASTAR coincide with transcription start sites identified directly by CAGE experiments and bear epigenetic hallmarks of active promoters. To determine if differential usage of alternative first exons can yield insights into the mechanism controlling gene expression, we applied SEASTAR to an RNA-seq dataset that tracked the reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells. We observed dynamic temporal changes in the usage of alternative first exons, along with correlated changes in transcription factor expression. Using a combined sequence motif and gene set enrichment analysis we identified N-Myc as a regulator of alternative first exon usage in the pluripotent state. Our results demonstrate that SEASTAR can leverage the available RNA-seq data to gain insights into the control of gene expression and alternative transcript variation in eukaryotic transcriptomes.

AB  - Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a lack of estrogen and progesterone receptor expression (ESR and PGR, respectively) and an absence of human epithelial growth factor receptor (ERBB2) amplification. Approximately 15-20% of breast malignancies are TNBC. Patients with TNBC often have an unfavorable prognosis. In addition, TNBC represents an important clinical challenge since it does not respond to hormone therapy. Methods: In this work, we integrated high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from normal and tumor tissues (obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA) and cell lines obtained through in-house sequencing or available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to generate a unified list of differentially expressed (DE) genes. Methylome and proteomic data were integrated to our analysis to give further support to our findings. Genes that were overexpressed in TNBC were then curated to retain new potentially druggable targets based on in silico analysis. Knocking-down was used to assess gene importance for TNBC cell proliferation. Results: Our pipeline analysis generated a list of 243 potential new targets for treating TNBC. We finally demonstrated that knock-down of Guanylate-Binding Protein 1 (GBP1), one of the candidate genes, selectively affected the growth of TNBC cell lines. Moreover, we showed that GBP1 expression was controlled by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in breast cancer cell lines. Conclusions: We propose that GBP1 is a new potential druggable therapeutic target for treating TNBC with enhanced EGFR expression.

AB  - Background: Sessile serrated adenomas/polyps are distinguished from hyperplastic colonic polyps subjectively by their endoscopic appearance and histological morphology. However, hyperplastic and sessile serrated polyps can have overlapping morphological features resulting in sessile serrated polyps diagnosed as hyperplastic. While sessile serrated polyps can progress into colon cancer, hyperplastic polyps have virtually no risk for colon cancer. Objective measures, differentiating these types of polyps would improve cancer prevention and treatment outcome. Methods: RNA-seq training data set and Affimetrix, Illumina testing data sets were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). RNA-seq single-end reads were filtered with FastX toolkit. Read mapping to the human genome, gene abundance estimation, and differential expression analysis were performed with Tophat-Cufflinks pipeline. Background correction, normalization, and probe summarization steps for Affimetrix arrays were performed using the robust multi-array method (RMA). For Illumina arrays, log(2)-scale expression data was obtained from GEO. Pathway analysis was implemented using Bioconductor package GSAR. To build a platform-independent molecular classifier that accurately differentiates sessile serrated and hyperplastic polyps we developed a new feature selection step. We also developed a simple procedure to classify new samples as either sessile serrated or hyperplastic with a class probability assigned to the decision, estimated using Cantelli's inequality. Results: The classifier trained on RNA-seq data and tested on two independent microarray data sets resulted in zero and three errors. The classifier was further tested using quantitative real-time PCR expression levels of 45 blinded independent formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens and was highly accurate. Pathway analyses have shown that sessile serrated polyps are distinguished from hyperplastic polyps and normal controls by: up-regulation of pathways implicated in proliferation, inflammation, cell-cell adhesion and down-regulation of serine threonine kinase signaling pathway; differential co-expression of pathways regulating cell division, protein trafficking and kinase activities. Conclusions: Most of the differentially expressed pathways are known as hallmarks of cancer and likely to explain why sessile serrated polyps are more prone to neoplastic transformation than hyperplastic. The new molecular classifier includes 13 genes and may facilitate objective differentiation between two polyps.

AB  - Polygonum minus is an herbal plant that grows in Southeast Asian countries andtraditionally used as medicine. This plant produces diverse secondary metabolitessuch as phenolic compounds and their derivatives, which are known to have roles inplant abiotic and biotic stress responses. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is a plant signalingmolecule that triggers transcriptional reprogramming in secondary metabolism andactivation of defense responses against many biotic and abiotic stresses. However, theeffect of MeJA elicitation on the genome-wide expression profile in the leaf tissue ofP. minus has not been well-studied due to the limited genetic information. Hence, weperformed Illumina paired-end RNA-seq for de novo reconstruction of P. minus leaftranscriptome to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to MeJAelicitation. A total of 182,111 unique transcripts (UTs) were obtained by de novo assemblyof 191.57 million paired-end clean reads using Trinity analysis pipeline. A total of 2374 UTswere identified to be significantly up-/down-regulated 24 h after MeJA treatment. TheseUTs comprising many genes related to plant secondary metabolite biosynthesis, defenseand stress responses. To validate our sequencing results, we analyzed the expression of21 selected DEGs by quantitative real-time PCR and found a good correlation betweenthe two analyses. The single time-point analysis in this work not only provides a usefulgenomic resource for P. minus but also gives insights on molecular mechanisms of stressresponses in P. minus.

AB  - Cork oak (Quercus suber) is native to southwest Europe and northwest Africa where it plays a crucial environmental and economical role. To tackle the cork oak production and industrial challenges, advanced research is imperative but dependent on the availability of a sequenced genome. To address this, we produced the first draft version of the cork oak genome. We followed a de novo assembly strategy based on high-throughput sequence data, which generated a draft genome comprising 23,347 scaffolds and 953.3 Mb in size. A total of 79,752 genes and 83,814 transcripts were predicted, including 33,658 high-confidence genes. An InterPro signature assignment was detected for 69,218 transcripts, which represented 82.6% of the total. Validation studies demonstrated the genome assembly and annotation completeness and highlighted the usefulness of the draft genome for read mapping of high-throughput sequence data generated using different protocols. All data generated is available through the public databases where it was deposited, being therefore ready to use by the academic and industry communities working on cork oak and/or related species.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing approaches, in particular RNA-seq, provide a genome-wide expression profiling allowing the identification of novel and rare transcripts such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA). Many RNA-seq studies have now been performed aimed at the characterization of lncRNAs and their possible involvement in cell development and differentiation in different organisms, cell types, and tissues. The adaptive immune system is an extraordinary context for the study of the role of lncRNAs in differentiation. Indeed lncRNAs seem to be key drivers in governing flexibility and plasticity of both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell, together with lineage-specific transcription factors and cytokines, acting as fine-tuners of fate choices in T cell differentiation. We describe here a pipeline for the identification of lncRNAs starting from RNA-Seq raw data.

AB  - Osteosarcomas are characterized by highly disrupted genomes. Although osteosarcomas lack common fusions, we find evidence of many tumour specific gene-gene fusion transcripts, likely due to chromosomal rearrangements and expression of transcription-induced chimeras. Most of the fusions result in out-of-frame transcripts, potentially capable of producing long novel protein sequences and a plethora of neoantigens. To identify fusions, we explored RNA-sequencing data to obtain detailed knowledge of transcribed fusions, by creating a novel program to compare fusions identified by deFuse to de novo transcripts generated by Trinity. This allowed us to confirm the deFuse results and identify unusual splicing patterns associated with fusion events. Using various existing tools combined with this custom program, we developed a pipeline for the identification of fusion transcripts applicable as targets for immunotherapy. In addition to identifying candidate neoantigens associated with fusions, we were able to use the pipeline to establish a method for measuring the frequency of fusion events, which correlated to patient outcome, as well as highlight some similarities between canine and human osteosarcomas. The results of this study of osteosarcomas underscores the numerous benefits associated with conducting a thorough analysis of fusion events within cancer samples.

AB  - Although a large number of clustering algorithms have been proposed to identify groups of co-expressed genes from microarray data, the question of if and how such methods may be applied to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data remains unaddressed. In this work, we investigate the use of data transformations in conjunction with Gaussian mixture models for RNA-seq co-expression analyses, as well as a penalized model selection criterion to select both an appropriate transformation and number of clusters present in the data. This approach has the advantage of accounting for per-cluster correlation structures among samples, which can be strong in RNA-seq data. In addition, it provides a rigorous statistical framework for parameter estimation, an objective assessment of data transformations and number of clusters and the possibility of performing diagnostic checks on the quality and homogeneity of the identified clusters. We analyze four varied RNA-seq data sets to illustrate the use of transformations and model selection in conjunction with Gaussian mixture models. Finally, we propose a Bioconductor package coseq (co-expression of RNA-seq data) to facilitate implementation and visualization of the recommended RNA-seq co-expression analyses.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorders encompassing wide classification of intellectual disabilities (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In the present study, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in three unrelated patients with developmental delay, hypotonia and ID. We found novel heterozygous mutations in two ID and ASD associated genes namely POGZ and KMT2D (c.1918C > CT (p.R640RC) in the POGZ, c.14531 delG (p.G4844Vfs*13) and c.13818C > CG (p.Y4606YX) in the KMT2D genes). Segregation analysis showed all three mutations are de novo mutations. Our data add information to the available literature and enlightens a new era of genotype-phenotype correlation. Molecular genetic testing will accelerate and simplify genetic counseling and promote accurate and immediate prognostic information allowing patients to benefit from precise diagnosis and risk assessment schemes for further conception.

AB  - With the increasing number of studies focusing on PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNAs), it is now pertinent to develop efficient tools dedicated towards piRNA analysis. We have developed a novel cluster prediction tool called PILFER (Plrna cLuster FindER), which can accurately predict piRNA clusters from small RNA sequencing data. PILFER is an open source, easy to use tool, and can be executed even on a personal computer with minimum resources. It uses a sliding-window mechanism by integrating the expression of the reads along with the spatial information to predict the piRNA clusters. We have additionally defined a piRNA analysis pipeline incorporating PILFER to detect and annotate piRNAs and their clusters from raw small RNA sequencing data and implemented it on publicly available data from healthy germline and somatic tissues. We compared PILFER with other existing piRNA cluster prediction tools and found it to be statistically more accurate and superior in many aspects such as the robustness of PILFER clusters is higher and memory efficiency is more. Overall, PILFER provides a fast and accurate solution to piRNA cluster prediction.

AB  - The Xenopus community has embraced recent advances in sequencing technology, resulting in the accumulation of numerous RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq datasets. However, easily accessing and comparing datasets generated by multiple laboratories is challenging. Thus, we have created a central space to view, search and analyze data, providing essential information on gene expression changes and regulatory elements present in the genome. XenMine (www.xenmine.org) is a user-friendly website containing published genomic datasets from both Xenopus tropicalis and Xenopus laevis. We have established an analysis pipeline where all published datasets are uniformly processed with the latest genome releases. Information from these datasets can be extracted and compared using an array of pre-built or custom templates. With these search tools, users can easily extract sequences for all putative regulatory domains surrounding a gene of interest, identify the expression values of a gene of interest over developmental time, and analyze lists of genes for gene ontology terms and publications. Additionally, XenMine hosts an in-house genome browser that allows users to visualize all available ChIP-Seq data, extract specifically marked sequences, and aid in identifying important regulatory elements within the genome. Altogether, XenMine is an excellent tool for visualizing, accessing and querying analyzed datasets rapidly and efficiently. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Global disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) incidence highlight the urgent need to identify genomic abnormalities in prostate tumors in different ethnic populations including Asian men. Objective: To systematically explore the genomic complexity and define disease-driven genetic alterations in PCa. Design, setting, and participants: The study sequenced whole-genome and transcriptome of tumor-benign paired tissues from 65 treatment-naive Chinese PCa patients. Subsequent targeted deep sequencing of 293 PCa-relevant genes was performed in another cohort of 145 prostate tumors. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The genomic alteration landscape in PCa was analyzed using an integrated computational pipeline. Relationships with PCa progression and survival were analyzed using nonparametric test, log-rank, and multivariable Cox regression analyses. Results and limitations: We demonstrated an association of high frequency of CHD1 deletion with a low rate of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and relatively high percentage of mutations in androgen receptor upstream activator genes in Chinese patients. We identified five putative clustered deleted tumor suppressor genes and provided experimental and clinical evidence that PCDH9, deleted/loss in approximately 23% of tumors, functions as a novel tumor suppressor gene with prognostic potential in PCa. Furthermore, axon guidance pathway genes were frequently deregulated, including gain/amplification of PLXNA1 gene in approximately 17% of tumors. Functional and clinical data analyses showed that increased expression of PLXNA1 promoted prostate tumor growth and independently predicted prostate tumor biochemical recurrence, metastasis, and poor survival in multi-institutional cohorts of patients with PCa. A limitation of this study is that other genetic alterations were not experimentally investigated. Conclusions: There are shared and salient genetic characteristics of PCa in Chinese and Caucasian men. Novel genetic alterations in PCDH9 and PLXNA1 were associated with disease progression.

AB  - Background: In gene set analysis, the researchers are interested in determining the gene sets that are significantly correlated with an outcome, e.g. disease status or treatment. With the rapid development of high throughput sequencing technologies, Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an important alternative to traditional expression arrays in gene expression studies. Challenges exist in adopting the existent algorithms to RNA-seq data given the intrinsic difference of the technologies and data. In RNA-seq experiments, the measure of gene expression is correlated with gene length. This inherent correlation may cause bias in gene set analysis. Results: We develop SeqGSA, a new method for gene set analysis with length bias adjustment for RNA-seq data. It extends from the R package GSA designed for microarrays. Our method compares the gene set maxmean statistic against permutations, while also taking into account of the statistics of the other gene sets. To adjust for the gene length bias, we implement a flexible weighted sampling scheme in the restandardization step of our algorithm. We show our method improves the power of identifying significant gene sets that are affected by the length bias. We also show that our method maintains the type I error comparing with another representative method for gene set enrichment test. Conclusions: SeqGSA is a promising tool for testing significant gene pathways with RNA-seq data while adjusting for inherent gene length effect. It enhances the power to detect gene sets affected by the bias and maintains type I error under various situations.

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important worldwide crops. The genome has been available for over 10 years and has undergone several rounds of annotation. We created a comprehensive database of transcripts from 29 public RNA sequencing data sets, officially predicted genes from Ensembl plants, and common contaminants in which to search for protein-level evidence. We re-analyzed nine publicly accessible rice proteomics data sets. In total, we identified 420K peptide spectrum matches from 47K peptides and 8,187 protein groups. 4168 peptides were initially classed as putative novel peptides (not matching official genes). Following a strict filtration scheme to rule out other possible explanations, we discovered 1,584 high confidence novel peptides. The novel peptides were clustered into 692 genomic loci where our results suggest annotation improvements. 80% of the novel peptides had an ortholog match in the curated protein sequence set from at least one other plant species. For the peptides clustering in intergenic regions (and thus potentially new genes), 101 loci were identified, for which 43 had a high-confidence hit for a protein domain. Our results can be displayed as tracks on the Ensembl genome or other browsers supporting Track Hubs, to support re-annotation of the rice genome.

AB  - Background: The identification of disease-causing variants in autosomal dominant diseases using exome-sequencing data remains a difficult task in small pedigrees. We combined several strategies to improve filtering and prioritizing of heterozygous variants using exome-sequencing datasets in familial Meniere disease: an in-house Pathogenic Variant (PAVAR) score, the Variant Annotation Analysis and Search Tool (VAAST-Phevor), Exomiser-v2, CADD, and FATHMM. We also validated the method by a benchmarking procedure including causal mutations in synthetic exome datasets. Results: PAVAR and VAAST were able to select the same sets of candidate variants independently of the studied disease. In contrast, Exomiser V2 and VAAST-Phevor had a variable correlation depending on the phenotypic information available for the disease on each family. Nevertheless, all the selected diseases ranked a limited number of concordant variants in the top 10 ranking, using the three systems or other combined algorithm such as CADD or FATHMM. Benchmarking analyses confirmed that the combination of systems with different approaches improves the prediction of candidate variants compared with the use of a single method. The overall efficiency of combined tools ranges between 68 and 71% in the top 10 ranked variants. Conclusions: Our pipeline prioritizes a short list of heterozygous variants in exome datasets based on the top 10 concordant variants combining multiple systems.

AB  - Background: Cane toads (Rhinella marina) are an iconic invasive species introduced to 4 continents and well utilized for studies of rapid evolution in introduced environments. Despite the long introduction history of this species, its profound ecological impacts, and its utility for demonstrating evolutionary principles, genetic information is sparse. Here we produce a de novo transcriptome spanning multiple tissues and life stages to enable investigation of the genetic basis of previously identified rapid phenotypic change over the introduced range. Findings: Using approximately 1.9 billion reads from developing tadpoles and 6 adult tissue-specific cDNA libraries, as well as a transcriptome assembly pipeline encompassing 100 separate de novo assemblies, we constructed 62 202 transcripts, of which we functionally annotated similar to 50%. Our transcriptome assembly exhibits 90% full-length completeness of the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs data set. Robust assembly metrics and comparisons with several available anuran transcriptomes and genomes indicate that our cane toad assembly is one of the most complete anuran genomic resources available. Conclusions: This comprehensive anuran transcriptome will provide a valuable resource for investigation of genes under selection during invasion in cane toads, but will also greatly expand our general knowledge of anuran genomes, which are underrepresented in the literature. The data set is publically available in NCBI and GigaDB to serve as a resource for other researchers.

AB  - Numerous statistical pipelines are now available for the differential analysis of gene expression measured with RNA-sequencing technology. Most of them are based on similar statistical frameworks after normalization, differing primarily in the choice of data distribution, mean and variance estimation strategy and data filtering. We propose an evaluation of the impact of these choices when few biological replicates are available through the use of synthetic data sets. This framework is based on real data sets and allows the exploration of various scenarios differing in the proportion of non-differentially expressed genes. Hence, it provides an evaluation of the key ingredients of the differential analysis, free of the biases associated with the simulation of data using parametric models. Our results show the relevance of a proper modeling of the mean by using linear or generalized linear modeling. Once the mean is properly modeled, the impact of the other parameters on the performance of the test is much less important. Finally, we propose to use the simple visualization of the raw P-value histogram as a practical evaluation criterion of the performance of differential analysis methods on real data sets.

AB  - Clustering of genes and/or samples is a common task in gene expression analysis. The goals in clustering can vary, but an important scenario is that of finding biologically meaningful subtypes within the samples. This is an application that is particularly appropriate when there are large numbers of samples, as in many human disease studies. With the increasing popularity of single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), many more controlled experiments on model organisms are similarly creating large gene expression datasets with the goal of detecting previously unknown heterogeneity within cells. It is common in the detection of novel subtypes to run many clustering algorithms, as well as rely on subsampling and ensemble methods to improve robustness. We introduce a Bioconductor R package, clusterExperiment, that implements a general and flexible strategy we entitle Resampling-based Sequential Ensemble Clustering (RSEC). RSEC enables the user to easily create multiple, competing clusterings of the data based on different techniques and associated tuning parameters, including easy integration of resampling and sequential clustering, and then provides methods for consolidating the multiple clusterings into a final consensus clustering. The package is modular and allows the user to separately apply the individual components of the RSEC procedure, i.e., apply multiple clustering algorithms, create a consensus clustering or choose tuning parameters, and merge clusters. Additionally, clusterExperiment provides a variety of visualization tools for the clustering process, as well as methods for the identification of possible cluster signatures or biomarkers. The R package clusterExperiment is publicly available through the Bioconductor Project, with a detailed manual (vignette) as well as well documented help pages for each function.

AB  - The practice of data sharing in the proteomics field took off and quickly spread in recent years as a result of collective effort. Nowadays, most journal editors mandate the submission of the original raw mass spectra to one of the data-bases of the ProteomeXchange consortium. With the exception of large institutional initiatives such as PeptideAtlas or the GPMDB, few new studies are however based on the reanalysis of mass spectrometry data. A wealth of information is thus left unexploited in public databases and repositories. Here, we present the large-scale reanalysis of 41 publicly available data sets corresponding to experiments carried out on the HeLa cancer cell line using a custom workflow. In addition to the search of new post-translational modification sites and "missing proteins", our main goal is to identify single amino acid variants and evaluate their impact on protein expression and stability through the spectral counting quantification approach. The X!Tandem software was selected to perform the search of a total of 56 363 701 tandem mass spectra against a customized variant protein database, compiled by the application of the in-house MzVar tool on HeLa-specific somatic and genomic variants retrieved from the COSMIC cell line project. After filtering the resulting identifications with a 1% FDR threshold computed at the protein level, 49 466 unique peptides were identified in 7266 protein entries, allowing the validation of 5576 protein entries in accordance with the HPP guidelines version 2.1. A new "missing protein" was observed (FRAT2, NX_O75474, chromosome 10), and 189 new phosphorylation and 392 new protein N-terminal acetylation sites could be identified. Twenty-four variant peptides were also identified, corresponding to 21 variants in 21 proteins. For three of the nine heterozygous cases where both the variant peptide and its wild-type counterpart were detected, the application of a two-tailed sign test showed a significant difference in the abundance of the two peptide versions.

AB  - Growth is among the most important traits for animal breeding. Understanding the mechanisms underlying growth differences between individuals can contribute to improving growth rates through more efficient breeding schemes. Here, we report a transcriptomic study in muscle and brain of fast-and slow-growing turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), a relevant flatfish in European and Asian aquaculture. Gene expression and allelic association between the two groups were explored. Up-regulation of the anaerobic glycolytic pathway in the muscle of fast-growing fish was observed, indicating a higher metabolic rate of white muscle. Brain expression differences were smaller and not associated with major growth-related genes, but with regulation of feeding-related sensory pathways. Further, SNP variants showing frequency differences between fast-and slow-growing fish pointed to genomic regions likely involved in growth regulation, and three of them were individually validated through SNP typing. Although different mechanisms appear to explain growth differences among families, general mechanisms seem also to be involved, and thus, results provide a set of useful candidate genes and markers to be evaluated for more efficient growth breeding programs and to perform comparative genomic studies of growth in fish and vertebrates.

AB  - Motivation: Despite RNA-seq reads provide quality scores that represent the probability of calling a correct base, these values are not probabilistically integrated in most alignment algorithms. Based on the quality scores of the reads, we propose to calculate a lower bound of the probability of alignment of any fast alignment algorithm that generates SAM files. This bound is called Fast Bayesian Bound (FBB) and serves as a canonical reference to compare alignment results across different algorithms. This Bayesian Bound intends to provide additional support to the current state-of- the-art aligners, not to replace them. Results: We propose a feasible Bayesian bound that uses quality scores of the reads to align them to a genome of reference. Two theorems are provided to efficiently calculate the Bayesian bound that under some conditions becomes the equality. The algorithm reads the SAM files generated by the alignment algorithms using multiple command option values. The program options are mapped into the FBB reference values, and all the aligners can be compared respect to the same accuracy values provided by the FBB. Stranded paired read RNA-seq data was used for evaluation purposes. The errors of the alignments can be calculated based on the information contained in the distance between the pairs given by Theorem 2, and the alignments to the incorrect strand. Most of the algorithms (Bowtie, Bowtie 2, SHRiMP2, Soap 2, Novoalign) provide similar results with subtle variations.

AB  - BackgroudPopulus nigra is a major tree species of ecological and economic importance for which several initiatives have been set up to create genomic resources. In order to access the large number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) typically needed to carry out a genome scan, the present study aimed at evaluating RNA sequencing as a tool to discover and type SNPs in genes within natural populations of P. nigra.ResultsWe have devised a bioinformatics pipeline to call and type SNPs from RNAseq reads and applied it to P. nigra transcriptomic data. The accuracy of the resulting RNAseq-based SNP calling and typing has been evaluated by (i) comparing their position and alleles to those previously reported in candidate genes, (ii) assessing their genotyping accuracy with respect to a previously available SNP chip and (iii) evaluating their inter-annual repeatability. We found that a combination of several callers yields a good compromise between the number of variants type and the accuracy of genotyping. We further used the resulting genotypic data to carry out basic genetic analyses whose results confirm the quality of the RNAseq-based SNP dataset.ConclusionsWe demonstrated the potential and accuracy of RNAseq as an efficient way to genotype SNPs in P. nigra. These results open prospects towards the use of this technology for quantitative and population genomics studies.

AB  - Background: Molecular signatures identified from high-throughput transcriptomic studies often have poor reliability and fail to reproduce across studies. One solution is to combine independent studies into a single integrative analysis, additionally increasing sample size. However, the different protocols and technological platforms across transcriptomic studies produce unwanted systematic variation that strongly confounds the integrative analysis results. When studies aim to discriminate an outcome of interest, the common approach is a sequential two-step procedure; unwanted systematic variation removal techniques are applied prior to classification methods. Results: To limit the risk of overfitting and over-optimistic results of a two-step procedure, we developed a novel multivariate integration method, MINT, that simultaneously accounts for unwanted systematic variation and identifies predictive gene signatures with greater reproducibility and accuracy. In two biological examples on the classification of three human cell types and four subtypes of breast cancer, we combined high-dimensional microarray and RNA-seq data sets and MINT identified highly reproducible and relevant gene signatures predictive of a given phenotype. MINT led to superior classification and prediction accuracy compared to the existing sequential two-step procedures. Conclusions: MINT is a powerful approach and the first of its kind to solve the integrative classification framework in a single step by combining multiple independent studies. MINT is computationally fast as part of the mixOmics R CRAN package, available at http://www.mixOmics.org/mixMINT/andhttp://cran.r-project.org/web/package s/mixOmics/.

AB  - Whole exome sequencing (WES) is widely utilized both in translational cancer genomics studies and in the setting of precision medicine. Stratification of individual's ethnicity is fundamental for the correct interpretation of personal genomic variation impact. We implemented EthSEQ to provide reliable and rapid ethnicity annotation from whole exome sequencing individual's data, validated it on 1000 Genome Project and TCGA data (2700 samples) demonstrating high precision, and finally assessed computational performances compared to other tools. EthSEQ can be integrated into any WES based processing pipeline and exploits multi-core capabilities.

AB  - Viral metagenomics (viromics) can provide a great contribution in expanding the knowledge of viruses and the relationship with their hosts. Viromic studies on marine organisms are still at a very early stage and only little efforts have been spent in the identification of viruses associated to marine invertebrates to date, leaving the complexity of marine viromes associated to bivalve hosts almost completely unexplored. However, the potential use of viromic approaches in the management of viral diseases affecting aquacultured species has been recently evidenced by the flourishing of studies on the Ostreid herpesvirus type-1, which has been associated with bivalve mortality events. Herein we discuss an effective pipeline to retrieve and reconstruct nearly complete and previously unreported viral genomes from existing host RNA-seq data. As a case study, we report the identification of seven RNA-virus genomes within the frame of a highly diversified viral community that characterizes both Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus galloprovincialis samples collected from the lagoon of Goro (Italy).

AB  - Recent advances in genomics present new opportunities for enhancing knowledge about gene regulation and function across a wide spectrum of organisms and species. Understanding and evaluating this information at the individual gene level is challenging, and not only requires extracting, collating and interpreting data from public genetic repositories, but also recognizing that much of the information has been developed through implementation of computationally based exon-calling algorithms, and thus may be inaccurate. Moreover, as these data usually have not been validated experimentally, results also may be incomplete and incorrect. This has created a quality-control problem for scientists who want to use individual gene-specific information in their research. Here, I describe a simple experimental strategy that takes advantage of the large amounts of untapped primary experimental data for characterizing gene expression that have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The approach consists of a readily adaptable pipeline that may be used to confirm exons, to define 5' and 3' un-translated regions and the beginnings and ends of individual genes, and to quantify alternative RNA splicing. The series of experimental strategies described offers effective replacements for older molecular biological methods, and can rapidly and reproducibly resolve major gene mapping problems.

AB  - PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), similar to 23-36 nucleotide-long small non-coding RNAs, earlier believed to be germline-specific, have now been identified in somatic cells including neural cells. However, piRNAs have not yet been studied in the human brain (HB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected brain. In this study, by next-generation small RNA sequencing, 564 and 451 piRNAs were identified in the HB and AD-affected brain respectively. The majority of the neuronal piRNAs have intronic origin wherein primary piRNAs are mostly from the negative strand. piRNAs originating from the coding sequence of mRNAs and tRNAs are highly conserved compared to other genomic contexts. We found 1923 mRNAs significantly downregulated in AD as the predicted targets of 125 up-regulated piRNAs. The filtering of targets based on our criteria coupled with pathway enrichment analysis of all the predicted targets resulted in five most significant AD-associated pathways enriched with four genes (CYCS, LIN7C, KPNA6, and RAB11A) found to be regulated by four piRNAs. The qRT-PCR study verified the reciprocal expression of piRNAs and their targets. This study provides the first evidence of piRNAs in the HB and AD which will provide the foundation for future studies to unravel the regulatory role of piRNAs in the human brain and associated diseases. The sequencing data have been submitted to the GEO database (Accession no. GSE85075).

AB  - We report an improved assembly (v3.6.1) of the melon (Cucumis melo L.) genome and a new genome annotation (v4.0). The optical mapping approach allowed correcting the order and the orientation of 21 previous scaffolds and permitted to correctly define the gap-size extension along the 12 pseudomolecules. A new comprehensive annotation was also built in order to update the previous annotation v3.5.1, released more than six years ago. Using an integrative annotation pipeline, based on exhaustive RNA-Seq collections and ad-hoctransposable element annotation, we identified 29,980 protein-coding loci. Compared to the previous version, the v4.0 annotation improved gene models in terms of completeness of gene structure, UTR regions definition, intron-exon junctions and reduction of fragmented genes. More than 8,000 new genes were identified, one third of them being well supported by RNA-Seq data. To make all the new resources easily exploitable and completely available for the scientific community, a redesigned Melonomics genomic platform was released at http://melonomics. net. The resources produced in this work considerably increase the reliability of the melon genome assembly and resolution of the gene models paving the way for further studies in melon and related species.

AB  - To evaluate the potential of an integrated clinical test to detect diverse classes of somatic and germline mutations relevant to pediatric oncology, we performed three-platform wholegenome (WGS), whole exome (WES) and transcriptome (RNA-Seq) sequencing of tumors and normal tissue from 78 pediatric cancer patients in a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory. Our analysis pipeline achieves high accuracy by cross-validating variants between sequencing types, thereby removing the need for confirmatory testing, and facilitates comprehensive reporting in a clinically-relevant timeframe. Three-platform sequencing has a positive predictive value of 97-99, 99, and 91% for somatic SNVs, indels and structural variations, respectively, based on independent experimental verification of 15,225 variants. We report 240 pathogenic variants across all cases, including 84 of 86 known from previous diagnostic testing (98% sensitivity). Combined WES and RNA-Seq, the current standard for precision oncology, achieved only 78% sensitivity. These results emphasize the critical need for incorporating WGS in pediatric oncology testing.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major type of liver cancer caused by the hepatitis B and C viruses, alcohol and exposure to aflatoxin. For HCC treatment, anticancer drugs have been widely used, but drug resistance in advanced HCC is an important problem, resulting in a continuous need for novel therapeutic targets. Therefore, in this study, we established a screening pipeline based on RNA-seq to screen novel therapeutic/prognostic targets in HCC and identified PRMT1 (Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 1). In the prognostic analysis, the overexpression of PRMT1 was clearly associated with poor prognosis in a number of HCC patient cohorts. Moreover, after PRMT1 knockdown, HCC cell lines exhibited cell growth and spheroid formation suppression, an increase in Sub-G1 cells by FACS analysis, and enrichment of the cell cycle pathway via functional enrichment analysis. With these results, we demonstrated that PRMT1 could be a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for HCC therapy.

AB  - ObjectiveTo perform whole exome sequencing in 928 Hispanic children and identify variants and genes associated with childhood obesity. MethodsSingle-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified from Illumina whole exome sequencing data using integrated read mapping, variant calling, and an annotation pipeline (Mercury). Association analyses of 74 obesity-related traits and exonic variants were performed using SeqMeta software. Rare autosomal variants were analyzed using gene-based association analyses, and common autosomal variants were analyzed at the SNV level. Results(1) Rare exonic variants in 10 genes and 16 common SNVs in 11 genes that were associated with obesity traits in a cohort of Hispanic children were identified, (2) novel rare variants in peroxisome biogenesis factor 1 (PEX1) associated with several obesity traits (weight, weight z score, BMI, BMI z score, waist circumference, fat mass, trunk fat mass) were discovered, and (3) previously reported SNVs associated with childhood obesity were replicated. ConclusionsConvergence of whole exome sequencing, a family-based design, and extensive phenotyping discovered novel rare and common variants associated with childhood obesity. Linking PEX1 to obesity phenotypes poses a novel mechanism of peroxisomal biogenesis and metabolism underlying the development of childhood obesity.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing technologies have recently been used in pharmacogenomic studies to characterize large panels of cancer cell lines at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. Among these technologies, RNA-sequencing enable profiling of alternatively spliced transcripts. Given the high frequency of mRNA splicing in cancers, linking this feature to drug response will open new avenues of research in biomarker discovery. To identify robust transcriptomic biomarkers for drug response across studies, we develop a meta-analytical framework combining the pharmacological data from two large-scale drug screening datasets. We use an independent pan-cancer pharmacogenomic dataset to test the robustness of our candidate biomarkers across multiple cancer types. We further analyze two independent breast cancer datasets and find that specific isoforms of IGF2BP2, NECTIN4, ITGB6, and KLHDC9 are significantly associated with AZD6244, lapatinib, erlotinib, and paclitaxel, respectively. Our results support isoform expressions as a rich resource for biomarkers predictive of drug response.

AB  - In the present study, the transcriptome profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of indigenous piglets against classical swine fever (CSF) vaccination was performed for elucidating the genetic basis of their differential humoral immunity. Piglets were vaccinated with lapinised strain of CSF virus (CSFV) followed by measurement of humoral immune response using c-ELISA at 28th day post vaccination (28dpv). The RNA sequencing data was analysed using established pipeline to determine set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in high responder as compared to low responder piglet. The differentially expressed important immune molecules were involved in regulating important pathways including antigen processing and presentation, T cell receptor signalling, B cell development, activation and signaling genes. The genes with differential expression also included TLR 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and antiviral molecules such as MX, and ISG (Interferon stimulated genes) family members. The protein-protein interaction of the immune genes was extracted for network representation. Most of the immune genes involved showed upregulation except the genes for antigen processing and presentation and T cell receptor signaling that were downregulated in the high responder. The immunologically important genes namely IFIT1, IFIT5, TAPBP, and TLR7 were validated using qRT-PCT and were observed to be in concordance with the RNA Seq results.

AB  - Background The WHO classification of brain tumours describes 15 subtypes of meningioma. Nine of these subtypes are allotted to WHO grade I, and three each to grade II and grade III. Grading is based solely on histology, with an absence of molecular markers. Although the existing classification and grading approach is of prognostic value, it harbours shortcomings such as ill-defined parameters for subtypes and grading criteria prone to arbitrary judgment. In this study, we aimed for a comprehensive characterisation of the entire molecular genetic landscape of meningioma to identify biologically and clinically relevant subgroups. Methods In this multicentre, retrospective analysis, we investigated genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of meningiomas from ten European academic neuro-oncology centres to identify distinct methylation classes of meningiomas. The methylation classes were further characterised by DNA copy number analysis, mutational profiling, and RNA sequencing. Methylation classes were analysed for progression-free survival outcomes by the Kaplan-Meier method. The DNA methylation-based and WHO classification schema were compared using the Brier prediction score, analysed in an independent cohort with WHO grading, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival data available, collected at the Medical University Vienna (Vienna, Austria), assessing methylation patterns with an alternative methylation chip. Findings We retrospectively collected 497 meningiomas along with 309 samples of other extra-axial skull tumours that might histologically mimic meningioma variants. Unsupervised clustering of DNA methylation data clearly segregated all meningiomas from other skull tumours. We generated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from all 497 meningioma samples. DNA methylation profiling distinguished six distinct clinically relevant methylation classes associated with typical mutational, cytogenetic, and gene expression patterns. Compared with WHO grading, classification by individual and combined methylation classes more accurately identifies patients at high risk of disease progression in tumours with WHO grade I histology, and patients at lower risk of recurrence among WHO grade II tumours (p= 0.0096) from the Brier prediction test). We validated this finding in our independent cohort of 140 patients with meningioma. Interpretation DNA methylation-based meningioma classification captures clinically more homogenous groups and has a higher power for predicting tumour recurrence and prognosis than the WHO classification. The approach presented here is potentially very useful for stratifying meningioma patients to observation-only or adjuvant treatment groups. We consider methylation-based tumour classification highly relevant for the future diagnosis and treatment of meningioma.

AB  - RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is an essential technique for transcriptome studies, hundreds of analysis tools have been developed since it was debuted. Although recent efforts have attempted to assess the latest available tools, they have not evaluated the analysis workflows comprehensively to unleash the power within RNA-seq. Here we conduct an extensive study analysing a broad spectrum of RNA-seq workflows. Surpassing the expression analysis scope, our work also includes assessment of RNA variant-calling, RNA editing and RNA fusion detection techniques. Specifically, we examine both short-and long-read RNA-seq technologies, 39 analysis tools resulting in similar to 120 combinations, and similar to 490 analyses involving 15 samples with a variety of germline, cancer and stem cell data sets. We report the performance and propose a comprehensive RNA-seq analysis protocol, named RNACocktail, along with a computational pipeline achieving high accuracy. Validation on different samples reveals that our proposed protocol could help researchers extract more biologically relevant predictions by broad analysis of the transcriptome.

AB  - Advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled profiling of microRNAs (miRNAs), however, a consensus pipeline for sequencing of small RNAs has not been established. We built and optimized an analysis pipeline using Partek Flow, circumventing the need for analyzing data via scripting languages. Our analysis assessed the effect of alignment reference, normalization method, and statistical model choice on biological data. The pipeline was evaluated using sequencing data from HaCaT cells transfected with either a non-silencing control or siRNA against Delta Np63 alpha, a p53 family member protein which is highly expressed in non-melanoma skin cancer and shown to regulate a number of miRNAs. We posit that 1) alignment and quantification to the miRBase reference provides the most robust quantitation of miRNAs, 2) normalizing sample reads via Trimmed Mean of M-values is the most robust method for accurate downstream analyses, and 3) use of the lognormal with shrinkage statistical model effectively identifies differentially expressed miRNAs. Using our pipeline, we identified previously unrecognized regulation of miRs-149-5p, 18a-5p, 19b-1-5p, 20a-5p, 590-5p, 744-5p and 93-5p by Delta Np63 alpha. Regulation of these miRNAs was validated by RT-qPCR, substantiating our small RNA-Seq pipeline. Further analysis of these miRNAs may provide insight into Delta Np63 alpha's role in cancer progression. By defining the optimal alignment reference, normalization method, and statistical model for analysis of miRNA sequencing data, we have established an analysis pipeline that may be carried out in Partek Flow or at the command line. In this manner, our pipeline circumvents some of the major hurdles encountered during small RNA-Seq analysis.

AB  - Background Material and Methods Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a global public health problem, which increases in prevalence every year. Evidence brings up that small populations of stem cells, the cancer stem cells (CSC), are responsible for tumour initiation, tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis. These cells play a crucial role in cancer development and treatment response, but the origin of CSCs remains unclear. In this research, we have sequenced the entire exome of the three different groups of cells of primary squamous cell carcinoma tumour from different patients, with the aim to understand their main genetic changes and to elucidate the possible origin of tumour cells and tumour stem cells. We performed a whole exome sequencing in the germinal line, tumour cells, and CSC ALDH+ samples from four HNSCC patients. An analysis pipeline was used to filter, score, rank, and prioritize candidate variants according to its effect on protein structure and phylogenetic conservation using available information on pathways and protein function databases. Results Conclusions Results showed variations in genes involved in oncogenic pathways and shed light on the evolution model of the CSC and tumour cells for each patient in which stem cells (CS) triggered the formation of CSC and these in turn become tumour cells. These findings support the idea that it is possible to identify in each individual patient if the CS are of tumour origin or vice versa, thus being possible a more personalized treatment.

AB  - Gene expression analysis is essential for understanding the rich repertoire of cellular functions. With the development of sensitive molecular tools such as single-cell RNA sequencing, extensive gene expression data can be obtained and analyzed from various tissues. Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) has emerged as a powerful complementary tool for single-cell genomics studies because of its ability to map and quantify the spatial distributions of single mRNAs at the subcellular level in their native tissue. Here, we present a detailed method to study the copy numbers and spatial localizations of single mRNAs in the cochlea and inferior colliculus. First, we demonstrate that smFISH can be performed successfully in adult cochlear tissue after decalcification. Second, we show that the smFISH signals can be detected with high specificity. Third, we adapt an automated transcript analysis pipeline to quantify and identify single mRNAs in a cell-specific manner. Lastly, we show that our method can be used to study possible correlations between transcriptional and translational activities of single genes. Thus, we have developed a detailed smFISH protocol that can be used to study the expression of single mRNAs in specific cell types of the peripheral and central auditory systems.

AB  - Efficient diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is met with multiple challenges, calling for a shift of focus from pathogen centric diagnostics towards identification of host-based multi-marker signatures. Transcriptomics offer a list of differentially expressed genes, but cannot by itself identify the most influential contributors to the disease phenotype. Here, we describe a computational pipeline that adopts an unbiased approach to identify a biomarker signature. Data from RNA sequencing from whole blood samples of TB patients were integrated with a curated genome-wide molecular interaction network, from which we obtain a comprehensive perspective of variations that occur in the host due to TB. We then implement a sensitive network mining method to shortlist gene candidates that are most central to the disease alterations. We then apply a series of filters that include applicability to multiple publicly available datasets aswell as additional validation on independent patient samples, and identify a signature comprising 10 genes - FCGR1A, HK3, RAB13, RBBP8, IFI44L, TIMM10, BCL6, SMARCD3, CYP4F3 and SLPI, that can discriminate between TB and healthy controls aswell as distinguish TB from latent tuberculosis and HIV in most cases. The signature has the potential to serve as a diagnostic marker of TB. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: As massively parallel sequencing is increasingly being used for clinical decision making, it has become critical to understand parameters that affect sequencing quality and to establish methods for measuring and reporting clinical. sequencing standards. In this report, we propose a definition for reduced coverage regions and describe a set of standards for variant calling in clinical sequencing applications. Methods: To enable sequencing centers to assess the regions of poor sequencing quality in their own data, we optimized and used a tool (ExCID) to identify reduced coverage loci within genes or regions of particular interest. We used this framework to examine sequencing dam from 500 patients generated in 10 projects at sequencing centers in the National Human Genome Research Institute/National Cancer Institute Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Consortium. Results: Tills approach identified reduced coverage regions in clinically relevant genes, including Known clinically relevant loci that were uniquely missed at individual centers, in multiple centers, and in all centers. Conclusion: This report provides a process road map for clinical squencing centers looking to perform similar analyses on their data.

AB  - Symbionts (e.g., endoparasites and commensals) play an integral role in their host's ecology, yet in many cases their diversity is likely underestimated. Although endoparasites are traditionally characterized using morphology, sequences of conserved genes, and shotgun metagenomics, host transcriptomes constitute an underused resource to identify these organisms' diversity. By isolating non-host transcripts from host transcriptomes, individual host tissues can now simultaneously reveal their endoparasite species richness (i.e., number of different taxa) and provide insights into parasite gene expression. These approaches can be used in host taxa whose endoparasites are mostly unknown, such as those of tropical amphibians. Here, we focus on the poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) as hosts, which are a Neotropical clade known for their bright coloration and defensive alkaloids. These toxins are an effective protection against vertebrate predators (e.g., snakes and birds), bacteria, and skin-biting ectoparasites (e.g., mosquitoes); however, little is known about their deterrence against eukaryotic endoparasites. With de novo transcriptomes of dendrobatids, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline for endoparasite identification that uses host annotated RNA-seq data and set of a priori parasite taxonomic terms, which are used to mine for specific endoparasites. We found a large community of helminths and protozoans that were mostly restricted to the digestive tract and a few systemic parasites (e.g., Trypanosoma). Contrary to our expectations, all dendrobatid frogs regardless of the presence of alkaloid defenses have endoparasites, with their highest species richness located in the frog digestive tract. Some of these organisms (e.g., roundworms) might prove to be generalists, as they were not found to be co-diversifying with their frog hosts. We propose that endoparasites may escape poison frogs' chemical defenses by colonizing tissues with fewer alkaloids than the frog's skin, where most toxins are stored.

AB  - Motivation: The past decade has seen an exponential increase in biological sequencing capacity, and there has been a simultaneous effort to help organize and archive some of the vast quantities of sequencing data that are being generated. Although these developments are tremendous from the perspective of maximizing the scientific utility of available data, they come with heavy costs. The storage and transmission of such vast amounts of sequencing data is expensive. Results: We present Quark, a semi-reference-based compression tool designed for RNA-seq data. Quark makes use of a reference sequence when encoding reads, but produces a representation that can be decoded independently, without the need for a reference. This allows Quark to achieve markedly better compression rates than existing reference-free schemes, while still relieving the burden of assuming a specific, shared reference sequence between the encoder and decoder. We demonstrate that Quark achieves state-of-the-art compression rates, and that, typically, only a small fraction of the reference sequence must be encoded along with the reads to allow reference-free decompression.

AB  - Microfluidic devices provide a low-input and efficient platform for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Existing microfluidic devices have a complicated multi-chambered structure for handling the multi-step process involved in RNA-seq and dilution between steps is used to negate the inhibitory effects among reagents. This makes the device difficult to fabricate and operate. Here we present microfluidic diffusion-based RNA-seq (MID-RNA-seq) for conducting scRNA-seq with a diffusion-based reagent swapping scheme. This device incorporates cell trapping, lysis, reverse transcription and PCR amplification all in one simple microfluidic device. MID-RNA-seq provides high data quality that is comparable to existing scRNA-seq methods while implementing a simple device design that permits multiplexing. The robustness and scalability of the MID-RNA-seq device will be important for transcriptomic studies of scarce cell samples.

AB  - Background: The heart responds to hemodynamic overload through cardiac hypertrophy and activation of the fetal gene program. However, these changes have not been thoroughly examined in individual cardiomyocytes, and the relation between cardiomyocyte size and fetal gene expression remains elusive. We established a method of high-throughput single-molecule RNA imaging analysis of in vivo cardiomyocytes and determined spatial and temporal changes during the development of heart failure. Methods and results: We applied three novel single-cell analysis methods, namely, single-cell quantitative PCR (sc-qPCR), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). Isolated cardiomyocytes and cross sections from pressure overloaded murine hearts after transverse aortic constriction (TAC) were analyzed at an early hypertrophy stage (2 weeks, TAC2W) and at a late heart failure stage (8 weeks, TAC8W). Expression of myosin heavy chain beta (Myh7), a representative fetal gene, was induced in some cardiomyocytes in TAC2W hearts and in more cardiomyocytes in TAC8W hearts. Expression levels of Myh7 varied considerably among cardiomyocytes. Myh7-expressing cardiomyocytes were significantly more abundant in the middle layer, compared with the inner or outer layers of TAC2W hearts, while such spatial differences were not observed in TAC8W hearts. Expression levels of Myh7 were inversely correlated with cardiomyocyte size and expression levels of mitochondria-related genes. Conclusions: We developed a new image-analysis pipeline to allow automated and unbiased quantification of gene expression at the single-cell level and determined the spatial and temporal regulation of heterogenous Myh7 expression in cardiomyocytes after pressure overload.

AB  - Motivation: Read assignment is an important first step in many metagenomic analysis workflows, providing the basis for identification and quantification of species. However ambiguity among the sequences of many strains makes it difficult to assign reads at the lowest level of taxonomy, and reads are typically assigned to taxonomic levels where they are unambiguous. We explore connections between metagenomic read assignment and the quantification of transcripts from RNA-Seq data in order to develop novel methods for rapid and accurate quantification of metagenomic strains. Results: We find that the recent idea of pseudoalignment introduced in the RNA-Seq context is highly applicable in the metagenomics setting. When coupled with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, reads can be assigned far more accurately and quickly than is currently possible with state of the art software, making it possible and practical for the first time to analyze abundances of individual genomes in metagenomics projects.

AB  - Background: Efforts to resolve the transcribed sequences in the equine genome have focused on protein-coding RNA. The transcription of the intergenic regions, although detected via total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), has yet to be characterized in the horse. The most recent equine transcriptome based on RNA-seq from several tissues was a prime opportunity to obtain a concurrent long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) database. Results: This lncRNA database has a breadth of eight tissues and a depth of over 20 million reads for select tissues, providing the deepest and most expansive equine lncRNA database. Utilizing the intergenic reads and three categories of novel genes from a previously published equine transcriptome pipeline, we better describe these groups by annotating the lncRNA candidates. These lncRNA candidates were filtered using an approach adapted from human lncRNA annotation, which removes transcripts based on size, expression, protein-coding capability and distance to the start or stop of annotated protein-coding transcripts. Conclusion: Our equine lncRNA database has 20,800 transcripts that demonstrate characteristics unique to lncRNA including low expression, low exon diversity and low levels of sequence conservation. These candidate lncRNA will serve as a baseline lncRNA annotation and begin to describe the RNA-seq reads assigned to the intergenic space in the horse.

AB  - Background: Thinning supplies of natural resources increase attention to sustainable microbial production of bio-based fuels. The strain Clostridium beijerinckii NRRL B-598 is a relatively well-described butanol producer regarding its genotype and phenotype under various conditions. However, a link between these two levels, lying in the description of the gene regulation mechanisms, is missing for this strain, due to the lack of transcriptomic data. Results: In this paper, we present a transcription profile of the strain over the whole fermentation using an RNA-Seq dataset covering six time-points with the current highest dynamic range among solventogenic clostridia. We investigated the accuracy of the genome sequence and particular genome elements, including pseudogenes and prophages. While some pseudogenes were highly expressed, all three identified prophages remained silent. Furthermore, we identified major changes in the transcriptional activity of genes using differential expression analysis between adjacent time-points. We identified functional groups of these significantly regulated genes and together with fermentation and cultivation kinetics captured using liquid chromatography and flow cytometry, we identified basic changes in the metabolism of the strain during fermentation. Interestingly, C. beijerinckii NRRL B-598 demonstrated different behavior in comparison with the closely related strain C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 in the latter phases of cultivation. Conclusions: We provided a complex analysis of the C. beijerinckii NRRL B-598 fermentation profile using several technologies, including RNA-Seq. We described the changes in the global metabolism of the strain and confirmed the uniqueness of its behavior. The whole experiment demonstrated a good reproducibility. Therefore, we will be able to repeat the experiment under selected conditions in order to investigate particular metabolic changes and signaling pathways suitable for following targeted engineering.

AB  - The significant advancement in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) have enabled the generation of several gigabytes of raw data in a single sequencing run. This amount of raw data introduces new scalability challenges in processing, storing and analyzing it, which cannot be solved using a single workstation, the only resource available for the majority of biological scientists, in a reasonable amount of time. These scalability challenges can be complemented by provisioning computational and storage resources using Cloud Computing in a cost-effective manner. There are multiple cloud providers offering cloud resources as a utility within various business models, service levels and functionalities. However, the lack of standards in cloud computing leads to interoperability issues among the providers rendering the selected one unalterable. Furthermore, even a single provider offers multiple configurations to choose from. Therefore, it is essential to develop a decision making system that facilitates the selection of the suitable cloud provider and configuration together with the capability to switch among multiple providers in an efficient and transparent manner. In this paper, we propose BioCtouo as a single point of entry to a multi-cloud environment for non-computer savvy bio-researchers. We discuss the architecture and components of Bioaoun and present the scheduling algorithm employed in Bioaoun. Experiments with different use-cases and scenarios reveal that Bioaoun can decrease the workflow execution time for a given budget while encapsulating the complexity of resource management in multiple cloud providers.

AB  - Ganoderma lucidum is a white-rot fungus best-known for its medicinal and ligninolytic activities. To discover the underlying genes responsible for these activities, we identified and characterized the natural antisense transcripts (NATs) using strand-specific (ss) RNA-seq data obtained from the mycelia, primordia and fruiting bodies. NATs were identified using a custom pipeline and then subjected to functional enrichment and differential expression analyses. A total of 1613 cis-and 244 trans-sense and antisense transcripts were identified. Mapping to GO terms and KEGG pathways revealed that NATs were frequently associated with genes of particular functional categories in particular stages. ssRT-qPCR experiments showed that the expression profiles of 30 of 50 (60%) transcripts were highly correlated with those of the RNA-seq results (r >= 0.9). Expression profiles of 22 of 25 (88%) pairs of NATs and STs were highly correlated (p <= 0.01), with 15 having r >= 0.8 and 4 having r <= -0.8. Six ligninmodifying genes and their NATs were analyzed in detail. Diverse patterns of differential expression among different stages and positive and negative correlations were observed. These results suggested that NATs were implicated in gene expression regulation in a function-group and developmental-stage specific manner through complex mechanisms.

AB  - Catharanthus roseus is a medicinal plant, which can produce monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) metabolites with biological activity and is rich in vinblastine and vincristine. With release of the scaffolded genome sequence of C. roseus, it is necessary to annotate gene functions on the whole-genome level. Recently, 53 RNA-seq datasets are available in public with different tissues (flower, root, leaf, seedling, and shoot) and different treatments (MeJA, PnWB infection and yeast elicitor). We used in-house data process pipeline with the combination of PCC and MR algorithms to construct a co-expression network exploring multi-dimensional gene expression (global, tissue preferential, and treat response) through multi-layered approaches. In the meanwhile, we added miRNA-target pairs, predicted PPI pairs into the network and provided several tools such as gene set enrichment analysis, functional module enrichment analysis, and motif analysis for functional prediction of the co-expression genes. Finally, we have constructed an online croFGD database (http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/croFGD/). We hope croFGD can help the communities to study the C. roseus functional genomics and make novel discoveries about key genes involved in some important biological processes.

AB  - Background: The reliability of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) output is affected by the quality of RNAs, which is in turn dependent on the quality of samples. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to reconsider the threshold of the RNA integrity number (RIN) and propose a simple and efficient storage scheme of blood samples for RNA-seq. Patients and methods: The RNAs were extracted from blood samples that were stored at different conditions and used for sequencing. The bioinformatic analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of RNA integrity and blood sample storage conditions on the gene expression analysis. Results: Our outcomes showed that the samples with RIN values more than 5.3 scarcely affected the quantitative results of RNA-seq, and the influence of inherent cellular physiological processes on RNA-seq output could be negligible. Conclusion: The blood samples stored at 4 degrees C within 7 days with RIN values more than 5.3 were available for RNA-seq.

AB  - High-throughput RNA-seq has revolutionized the process of small RNA (sRNA) discovery, leading to a rapid expansion of sRNA categories. In addition to the previously well-characterized sRNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), recent emerging studies have spotlighted on tRNA-derived sRNAs (tsRNAs) and rRNA-derived sRNAs (rsRNAs) as new categories of sRNAs that bear versatile functions. Since existing software and pipelines for sRNA annotation are mostly focused on analyzing miRNAs or piRNAs, here we developed the sRNA annotation pipeline optimized for rRNA-and tRNA-derived sRNAs (SPORTS1.0). SPORTS1.0 is optimized for analyzing tsRNAs and rsRNAs from sRNA-seq data, in addition to its capacity to annotate canonical sRNAs such as miRNAs and piRNAs. Moreover, SPORTS1.0 can predict potential RNA modification sites based on nucleotide mismatches within sRNAs. SPORTS1.0 is precompiled to annotate sRNAs for a wide range of 68 species across bacteria, yeast, plant, and animal kingdoms, while additional species for analyses could be readily expanded upon end users' input. For demonstration, by analyzing sRNA datasets using SPORTS1.0, we reveal that distinct signatures are present in tsRNAs and rsRNAs from different mouse cell types. We also find that compared to other sRNA species, tsRNAs bear the highest mismatch rate, which is consistent with their highly modified nature. SPORTS1.0 is an opensource software and can be publically accessed at https://github.com/junchaoshi/sports1.0.

AB  - Multi-region sequencing is used to detect intratumor genetic heterogeneity (ITGH) in tumors. To assess whether genuine ITGH can be distinguished from sequencing artifacts, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on three anatomically distinct regions of the same tumor with technical replicates to estimate technical noise. Somatic variants were detected with three different WES pipelines and subsequently validated by high-depth amplicon sequencing. The cancer-only pipeline was unreliable, with about 69% of the identified somatic variants being false positive. Even withmatched normal DNA for which 82% of the somatic variants were detected reliably, only 36%-78% were found consistently in technical replicate pairs. Overall, 34%-80% of the discordant somatic variants, which could be interpreted as ITGH, were found to constitute technical noise. Excluding mutations affecting low-mappability regions or occurring in certain mutational contexts was found to reduce artifacts, yet detection of subclonal mutations by WES in the absence of orthogonal validation remains unreliable.

AB  - Identification of viral integration sites has been important in understanding the pathogenesis and progression of diseases associated with particular viral infections. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled researchers to understand the impact that viral integration has on the host, such as tumorigenesis. Current computational methods to analyze NGS data of virus-host junction sites have been limited in terms of their accessibility to a broad user base. In this study, we developed a software application (named ChimericSeq), that is the first program of its kind to offer a graphical user interface, compatibility with both Windows and Mac operating systems, and optimized for effectively identifying and annotating virus-host chimeric reads within NGS data. In addition, ChimericSeq's pipeline implements custom filtering to remove artifacts and detect reads with quantitative analytical reporting to provide functional significance to discovered integration sites. The improved accessibility of ChimericSeq through a GUI interface in both Windows and Mac has potential to expand NGS analytical support to a broader spectrum of the scientific community.

AB  - Insertions and deletions (indels) have been implicated in dozens of human diseases through the radical alteration of gene function by short frameshift indels as well as long indels. However, the accurate detection of these indels from next-generation sequencing data is still challenging. This is particularly true for intermediate-size indels (>= 50 bp), due to the short DNA sequencing reads. Here, we developed a new method that predicts intermediate-size indels using BWA soft-clipped fragments (unmatched fragments in partially mapped reads) and unmapped reads. We report the performance comparison of our method, GATK, PINDEL and ScanIndel, using whole exome sequencing data from the same samples. False positive and false negative counts were determined through Sanger sequencing of all predicted indels across these four methods. The harmonic mean of the recall and precision, F-measure, was used to measure the performance of each method. Our method achieved the highest F-measure of 0.84 in one sample, compared to 0.56 for GATK, 0.52 for PINDEL and 0.46 for ScanIndel. Similar results were obtained in additional samples, demonstrating that our method was superior to the other methods for detecting intermediate-size indels. We believe that this methodology will contribute to the discovery of intermediate-size indels associated with human disease.

AB  - Advanced high-throughput sequencing technology accumulated massive amount of genomics and transcriptomics data in the public databases. Due to the high technical accessibility, DNA and RNA sequencing have huge potential for the study of gene functions in most species including animals and crops. A proven analytic platform to convert sequencing data to gene functional information is co-functional network. Because all genes exert their functions through interactions with others, network analysis is a legitimate way to study gene functions. The workflow of network-based functional study is composed of three steps: (i) inferencing co-functional links, (ii) evaluating and integrating the links into genome-scale networks, and (iii) generating functional hypotheses from the networks. Co-functional links can be inferred from DNA sequencing data by using phylogenetic profiling, gene neighborhood, domain profiling, associalogs, and co-expression analysis from RNA sequencing data. The inferred links are then evaluated and integrated into a genome-scale network with aid from gold-standard co-functional links. Functional hypotheses can be generated from the network based on (i) network connectivity, (ii) network propagation, and (iii) subnetwork analysis. The functional analysis pipeline described here requires only sequencing data which can be readily available for most species by next-generation sequencing technology. Therefore, co-functional networks will greatly potentiate the use of the sequencing data for the study of genetics in any cellular organism.

AB  - Messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is a tightly controlled process that is integral to gene expression. It features intricate and dynamic interactions of the small and large subunits of the ribosome with mRNA, aided by multiple auxiliary factors during distinct initiation, elongation and termination phases. The recently developed ribosome profiling method can generate transcriptome-wide surveys of translation and its regulation. Ribosome profiling records the footprints of fully assembled ribosomes along mRNA and thus primarily interrogates the elongation phase of translation. Importantly, it does not monitor multiple substeps of initiation and termination that involve complexes between the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) and mRNA. Here we describe a related method, termed `translation complex profile sequencing' (TCP-seq), that is uniquely capable of recording positions of any type of ribosome-mRNA complex transcriptome-wide. It uses fast covalent fixation of translation complexes in live cells, followed by RNase footprinting of translation intermediates and their separation into complexes involving either the full ribosome or the SSU. The footprints derived from each type of complex are then deep-sequenced separately, generating native distribution profiles during the elongation, as well as the initiation and termination stages of translation. We provide the full TCP-seq protocol for Saccharomyces cerevisiae liquid suspension culture, including a data analysis pipeline. The protocol takes similar to 3 weeks to complete by a researcher who is well acquainted with standard molecular biology techniques and who has some experience in ultracentrifugation and the preparation of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries. Basic Bash and UNIX/Linux command skills are required to use the bioinformatics tools provided.

AB  - The quality of RNA sequencing data relies on specific priming by the primer used for reverse transcription (RT-primer). Nonspecific annealing of the RT-primer to the RNA template can generate reads with incorrect cDNA ends and can cause misinterpretation of data (RT mispriming). This kind of artifact in RNA-seq based technologies is underappreciated and currently no adequate tools exist to computationally remove them from published data sets. We show that mispriming can occur with as little as two bases of complementarity at the 3' end of the primer followed by intermittent regions of complementarity. We also provide a computational pipeline that identifies cDNA reads produced from RT mispriming, allowing users to filter them out from any aligned data set. Using this analysis pipeline, we identify thousands of mispriming events in a dozen published data sets from diverse technologies including short RNA-seq, total/mRNA-seq, HITS-CLIP, and GRO-seq. We further show how RT mispriming can lead to misinterpretation of data. In addition to providing a solution to computationally remove RT-misprimed reads, we also propose an experimental solution to completely avoid RT-mispriming by performing RNA-seq using thermostable group II intron derived reverse transcriptase (TGIRT-seq).

AB  - Background: Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-cap-seq is a high-throughput sequencing method that combines ATAC-seq with targeted nucleic acid enrichment of precipitated DNA fragments. There are increased analytical difficulties arising from working with a set of regions of interest that may be small in number and biologically dependent. Common statistical pipelines for RNA sequencing might be assumed to apply but can give misleading results on ATAC-cap-seq data. A tool is needed to allow a nonspecialist user to quickly and easily summarize data and apply sensible and effective normalization and analysis. Results: We developed atacR to allow a user to easily analyze their ATAC enrichment experiment. It provides comprehensive summary functions and diagnostic plots for studying enriched tag abundance. Application of between-sample normalization is made straightforward. Functions for normalizing based on user-defined control regions, whole library size, and regions selected from the least variable regions in a dataset are provided. Three methods for detecting differential abundance of tags from enriched methods are provided, including bootstrap t, Bayes factor, and a wrapped version of the standard exact test in the edgeR package. We compared the precision, recall, and F-score of each detection method on resampled datasets at varying replicate, significance threshold, and genes changed and found that the Bayes factor method had the greatest overall detection power, though edgeR was slightly stronger in simulations with lower numbers of genes changed. Conclusions: Our package allows a nonspecialist user to easily and effectively apply methods appropriate to the analysis of ATAC-cap-seq in a reproducible manner. The package is implemented in pure R and is fully interoperable with common workflows in Bioconductor.

AB  - Next generation high-throughput sequencing has enabled sensitive and unambiguous analysis of RNA populations in cells. Here, we describe a method for isolation and strand-specific sequencing of small RNA pools from bacteria that can be multiplexed to accommodate multiple biological samples in a single experiment. Small RNAs are isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase. This allows for 3' adapter ligation to CRISPR RNAs, which don't have pre-existing 3'-OH ends. Pre-adenylated adapters are then ligated using T4 RNA ligase 1 in the absence of ATP and with a high concentration of polyethylene glycol (PEG). The 3' capture step enables precise determination of the 3' ends of diverse RNA molecules. Additionally, a random hexamer in the ligated adapter helps control for potential downstream amplification bias. Following reverse-transcription, the cDNA product is circularized and libraries are prepared by PCR. We show that the amplified library need not be visible by gel electrophoresis for efficient sequencing of the desired product. Using this method, we routinely prepare RNA sequencing libraries from minute amounts of purified small RNA. This protocol is tailored to assay for CRISPR RNA biogenesis in bacteria through sequencing of mature CRISPR RNAs, but can be used to sequence diverse classes of small RNAs. We also provide a fully worked example of our data processing pipeline, with instructions for running the provided scripts.

AB  - Background: With the advent of the age of big data in bioinformatics, large volumes of data and high-performance computing power enable researchers to perform re-analyses of publicly available datasets at an unprecedented scale. Ever more studies imply the microbiome in both normal human physiology and a wide range of diseases. RNA sequencing technology (RNA-seq) is commonly used to infer global eukaryotic gene expression patterns under defined conditions, including human disease-related contexts; however, its generic nature also enables the detection of microbial and viral transcripts. Findings: We developed a bioinformatic pipeline to screen existing human RNA-seq datasets for the presence of microbial and viral reads by re-inspecting the non-human-mapping read fraction. We validated this approach by recapitulating outcomes from six independent, controlled infection experiments of cell line models and compared them with an alternative metatranscriptomic mapping strategy. We then applied the pipeline to close to 150 terabytes of publicly available raw RNA-seq data from more than 17,000 samples from more than 400 studies relevant to human disease using state-of-the-art high-performance computing systems. The resulting data from this large-scale re-analysis are made available in the presented MetaMap resource. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that common human RNA-seq data, including those archived in public repositories, might contain valuable information to correlate microbial and viral detection patterns with diverse diseases. The presented MetaMap database thus provides a rich resource for hypothesis generation toward the role of the microbiome in human disease. Additionally, codes to process new datasets and perform statistical analyses are made available.

AB  - Motivation: Next-generation sequencing is now an established method in genomics, and massive amounts of sequencing data are being generated on a regular basis. Analysis of the sequencing data is typically performed by lab-specific in-house solutions, but the agreement of results from different facilities is often small. General standards for quality control, reproducibility and documentation are missing. Results: We developed NGS-pipe, a flexible, transparent and easy-to-use framework for the design of pipelines to analyze whole-exome, whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing data. NGSpipe facilitates the harmonization of genomic data analysis by supporting quality control, documentation, reproducibility, parallelization and easy adaptation to other NGS experiments.

AB  - Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (PRCC) is a heterogeneous disease with variations in disease progression and clinical outcomes. The advent of next generation sequencing techniques (NGS) has generated data from patients that can be analysed to develop a predictive model. In this study, we have adopted a machine learning approach to identify biomarkers and build classifiers to discriminate between early and late stages of PRCC from gene expression profiles. A machine learning pipeline incorporating different feature selection algorithms and classification models is developed to analyse RNA sequencing dataset (RNASeq). Further, to get a reliable feature set, we extracted features from different partitions of the training dataset and aggregated them into feature sets for classification. We evaluated the performance of different algorithms on the basis of 10-fold cross validation and independent test dataset. 10-fold cross validation was also performed on a microarray dataset of PRCC. A random forest based feature selection (varSelRF) yielded minimum number of features (104) and a best performance with area under Precision Recall curve (PR-AUC) of 0.804, MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) of 0.711 and accuracy of 88% with Shrunken Centroid classifier on a test dataset. We identified 80 genes that are consistently altered between stages by different feature selection algorithms. The extracted features are related to cellular components - centromere, kinetochore and spindle, and biological process mitotic cell cycle. These observations reveal potential mechanisms for an increase in chromosome instability in the late stage of PRCC. Our study demonstrates that the gene expression profiles can be used to classify stages of PRCC.

AB  - For many years, efforts to decipher the various cellular components that comprise the CNS were stymied by a lack of technical strategies for isolating and profiling the brain's resident cell types. The advent of transcriptional profiling, combined with powerful new purification schemes, changed this reality and transformed our understanding of the macroglial populations within the brain. Here, we chronicle the historical context and scientific setting for our efforts to transcriptionally profile neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, and highlight some of the profound discoveries that were cultivated by these data. Following a lengthy battle with pancreatic cancer, Ben Barres passed away during the writing of this Progression piece. Among Ben's innumerable contributions to the greater scientific community, his addition of publicly available transcriptome databases of CNS cell types will forever remain a relic of his generous spirit and boundless scientific curiosity. Although he had impressively committed a majority of these enormous gene lists to memory, Ben could oftentimes be spotted at meetings buried in his cell phone on the Barres RNAseq database. Perhaps the only thing he enjoyed more than exploring these data himself, was knowing how useful these contributions had been (and will hopefully continue to be) to his scientific peers.

AB  - Online sequence repositories are teeming with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from a wide range of eukaryotes. Although most of these data sets contain large numbers of organelle-derived reads, researchers tend to ignore these data, focusing instead on the nuclear-derived transcripts. Consequently, GenBank contains massive amounts of organelle RNA-Seq data that are just waiting to be downloaded and analyzed. Recently, a team of scientists designed an open-source bioinformatics program called ChloroSeq, which systemically analyzes an organelle transcriptome using RNA-Seq. The ChloroSeq pipeline uses RNA-Seq alignment data to deliver detailed analyses of organelle transcriptomes, which can be fed into statistical software for further analysis and for generating graphical representations of the data. In addition to providing data on expression levels via coverage statistics, ChloroSeq can examine splicing efficiency and RNA editing profiles. Ultimately, ChloroSeq provides a well-needed avenue for researchers of all stripes to start exploring organelle transcription and could be a key step toward a more thorough understanding of organelle gene expression.

AB  - Gene functionality is closely connected to its expression specificity across tissues and cell types. RNA-Seq is a powerful quantitative tool to explore genome wide expression. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive RNA-Seq dataset across the same 13 tissues for mouse and rat, two of the most relevant species for biomedical research. The dataset provides the transcriptome across tissues from three male C57BL6 mice and three male Han Wistar rats. We also describe our bioinformatics pipeline to process and technically validate the data. Principal component analysis shows that tissue samples from both species cluster similarly. We show by comparative genomics that many genes with high sequence identity with respect to their human orthologues also have a highly correlated tissue distribution profile and are in agreement with manually curated literature data for human. In summary, the present study provides a unique resource for comparative genomics and will facilitate the analysis of tissue specificity and cross-species conservation in higher organisms.

AB  - Objective The bacterial intestinal microbiota plays major roles in human physiology and IBDs. Although some data suggest a role of the fungal microbiota in IBD pathogenesis, the available data are scarce. The aim of our study was to characterise the faecal fungal microbiota in patients with IBD. Design Bacterial and fungal composition of the faecal microbiota of 235 patients with IBD and 38 healthy subjects (HS) was determined using 16S and ITS2 sequencing, respectively. The obtained sequences were analysed using the Qiime pipeline to assess composition and diversity. Bacterial and fungal taxa associated with clinical parameters were identified using multivariate association with linear models. Correlation between bacterial and fungal microbiota was investigated using Spearman's test and distance correlation. Results We observed that fungal microbiota is skewed in IBD, with an increased Basidiomycota/Ascomycota ratio, a decreased proportion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and an increased proportion of Candida albicans compared with HS. We also identified disease-specific alterations in diversity, indicating that a Crohn's disease-specific gut environment may favour fungi at the expense of bacteria. The concomitant analysis of bacterial and fungal microbiota showed a dense and homogenous correlation network in HS but a dramatically unbalanced network in IBD, suggesting the existence of disease-specific inter-kingdom alterations. Conclusions Besides bacterial dysbiosis, our study identifies a distinct fungal microbiota dysbiosis in IBD characterised by alterations in biodiversity and composition. Moreover, we unravel here disease-specific inter-kingdom network alterations in IBD, suggesting that, beyond bacteria, fungi might also play a role in IBD pathogenesis.

AB  - Enormous databases of short-read RNA-seq experiments such as the NIH Sequencing Read Archive are now available. These databases could answer many questions about condition-specific expression or population variation, and this resource is only going to grow over time. However, these collections remain difficult to use due to the inability to search for a particular expressed sequence. Although some progress has been made on this problem, it is still not feasible to search collections of hundreds of terabytes of short-read sequencing experiments. We introduce an indexing scheme called split sequence bloom trees (SSBTs) to support sequence-based querying of terabyte scale collections of thousands of short-read sequencing experiments. SSBT is an improvement over the sequence bloom tree (SBT) data structure for the same task. We apply SSBTs to the problem of finding conditions under which query transcripts are expressed. Our experiments are conducted on a set of 2652 publicly available RNA-seq experiments for the breast, blood, and brain tissues. We demonstrate that this SSBT index can be queried for a 1000nt sequence in <4 minutes using a single thread and can be stored in just 39 GB, a fivefold improvement in search and storage costs compared with SBT.

AB  - Fast accumulation of sequencing data on plant virus genomes and plant transcriptomes demands periodic re-evaluation of current views on the genome evolution of viruses. Here, we substantiate and further detail our previously mostly speculative model on the origin and evolution of triple gene block (TGB) encoding plant virus movement proteins TGB1, TGB2, and TGB3. Recent experimental data on functional competence of transport gene modules consisting of two proteins related to TGB1 and TGB2, as well as sequence analysis data on similarity of TGB2 and TGB3 encoded by a viral genome and virus-like RNAs identified in a plant transcriptomes, suggest that TGB evolution involved events of gene duplication and gene transfer between viruses. In addition, our analysis identified that plant RNA-seq data assembled into RNA virus-like contigs encode a significant variety of hydrophobic proteins. Functions of these orphan proteins are still obscure; however, some of them are obviously related to hydrophobic virion proteins of recently sequenced invertebrate (mostly insect) viruses, therefore supporting the current view on a common origin for many groups of plant and insect RNA-containing viruses. Moreover, these findings may suggest that the function of at least some orphan hydrophobic proteins is to provide plant viruses with the ability to infect insect hosts. In general, our observations emphasize that comparison of RNA virus sequences in a large variety of land plants and algae isolated geographically and ecologically may lead to experimental confirmation of previously purely speculative schemes of evolution of single genes, gene modules, and whole genomes.

AB  - Background: Although the cucumber reference genome and its annotation were published several years ago, the functional annotation of predicted genes, particularly protein-coding genes, still requires further improvement. In general, accurately determining orthologous relationships between genes allows for better and more robust functional assignments of predicted genes. As one of the most reliable strategies, the determination of collinearity informationmay facilitate reliable orthology inferences among genes from multiple related genomes. Currently, the identification of collinear segments has mainly been based on conservation of gene order and orientation. Over the course of plant genome evolution, various evolutionary events have disrupted or distorted the order of genes along chromosomes, making it difficult to use those genes as genome-wide markers for plant genome comparisons. Results: Using the localized LASTZ/MULTIZ analysis pipeline, we aligned 15 genomes, including cucumber and other related angiosperm plants, and identified a set of genomic segments that are short in length, stable in structure, uniform in distribution and highly conserved across all 15 plants. Compared with protein-coding genes, these conserved segments were more suitable for use as genomic markers for detecting collinear segments among distantly divergent plants. Guided by this set of identified collinear genomic segments, we inferred 94,486 orthologous protein-coding gene pairs (OPPs) between cucumber and 14 other angiosperm species, which were used as proxies for transferring functional terms to cucumber genes from the annotations of the other 14 genomes. In total, 10,885 protein-coding genes were assigned Gene Ontology (GO) terms which was nearly 1,300more than results collected in Uniprot-proteomic database. Our results showed that annotation accuracy would been improved compared with other existing approaches. Conclusions: In this study, we provided an alternative resource for the functional annotation of predicted cucumber protein-coding genes, which we expect will be beneficial for the cucumber's biological study, accessible from http://cmb. bnu. edu. cn/functional_annotation. Meanwhile, using the cucumber reference genome as a case study, we presented an efficient strategy for transferring gene functional information from previously well-characterized protein-coding genes inmodel species to newly sequenced or "non-model" plant species.

Major components of that framework are genome databases and analysis resources focusing on individual (reference) genomes providing flexible and intuitive access to data. Another main focus is the integration of genomes from both model and crop plants to form a scaffold for comparative genomics, assisted by specialized tools such as the CrowsNest viewer to explore conserved gene order (synteny). Data exchange and integrated search functionality with/over many plant genome databases is provided within the transPLANT project.

AB  - RNA nanostructures can be used as scaffolds to organize, combine, and control molecular functionalities, with great potential for applications in nanomedicine and synthetic biology. The single-stranded RNA origami method allows RNA nanostructures to be folded as they are transcribed by the RNA polymerase. RNA origami structures provide a stable framework that can be decorated with functional RNA elements such as riboswitches, ribozymes, interaction sites, and aptamers for binding small molecules or protein targets. The rich library of RNA structural and functional elements combined with the possibility to attach proteins through aptamer-based binding creates virtually limitless possibilities for constructing advanced RNA-based nanodevices. In this chapter we provide a detailed protocol for the single-stranded RNA origami design method using a simple 2-helix tall structure as an example. The first step involves 3D modeling of a double-crossover between two RNA double helices, followed by decoration with tertiary motifs. The second step deals with the construction of a 2D blueprint describing the secondary structure and sequence constraints that serves as the input for computer programs. In the third step, computer programs are used to design RNA sequences that are compatible with the structure, and the resulting outputs are evaluated and converted into DNA sequences to order.

AB  - We introduce alevin, a fast end-to-end pipeline to process droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing data, performing cell barcode detection, read mapping, unique molecular identifier (UMI) deduplication, gene count estimation, and cell barcode whitelisting. Alevin's approach to UMI deduplication considers transcript-level constraints on the molecules from which UMIs may have arisen and accounts for both gene-unique reads and reads that multimap between genes. This addresses the inherent bias in existing tools which discard gene-ambiguous reads and improves the accuracy of gene abundance estimates. Alevin is considerably faster, typically eight times, than existing gene quantification approaches, while also using less memory.

AB  - Background: Dictyostelium discoideum, a soil-dwelling social amoeba, is a model for the study of numerous biological processes. Research in the field has benefited mightily from the adoption of next-generation sequencing for genomics and transcriptomics. Dictyostelium biologists now face the widespread challenges of analyzing and exploring high dimensional data sets to generate hypotheses and discovering novel insights. Results: We present dictyExpress (2.0), a web application designed for exploratory analysis of gene expression data, as well as data from related experiments such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). The application features visualization modules that include time course expression profiles, clustering, gene ontology enrichment analysis, differential expression analysis and comparison of experiments. All visualizations are interactive and interconnected, such that the selection of genes in one module propagates instantly to visualizations in other modules. dictyExpress currently stores the data from over 800 Dictyostelium experiments and is embedded within a general-purpose software framework for management of next-generation sequencing data. dictyExpress allows users to explore their data in a broader context by reciprocal linking with dictyBase-a repository of Dictyostelium genomic data. In addition, we introduce a companion application called GenBoard, an intuitive graphic user interface for data management and bioinformatics analysis. Conclusions: dictyExpress and GenBoard enable broad adoption of next generation sequencing based inquiries by the Dictyostelium research community. Labs without the means to undertake deep sequencing projects can mine the data available to the public. The entire information flow, from raw sequence data to hypothesis testing, can be accomplished in an efficient workspace. The software framework is generalizable and represents a useful approach for any research community. To encourage more wide usage, the backend is open-source, available for extension and further development by bioinformaticians and data scientists.

AB  - BackgroundRNA-seq, wherein RNA transcripts expressed in a sample are sequenced and quantified, has become a widely used technique to study disease and development. With RNA-seq, transcription abundance can be measured, differential expression genes between groups and functional enrichment of those genes can be computed. However, biological insights from RNA-seq are often limited by computational analysis and the enormous volume of resulting data, preventing facile and meaningful review and interpretation of gene expression profiles. Particularly, in cases where the samples under study exhibit uncontrolled variation, deeper analysis of functional enrichment would be necessary to visualize samples' gene expression activity under each biological function.ResultsWe developed a Bioconductor package rgsepd that streamlines RNA-seq data analysis by wrapping commonly used tools DESeq2 and GOSeq in a user-friendly interface and performs a gene-subset linear projection to cluster heterogeneous samples by Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Rgsepd computes significantly enriched GO terms for each experimental condition and generates multidimensional projection plots highlighting how each predefined gene set's multidimensional expression may delineate samples.ConclusionsThe rgsepd serves to automate differential expression, functional annotation, and exploratory data analyses to highlight subtle expression differences among samples based on each significant biological function.

AB  - Rapid identification of clinically significant variants is key to the successful application of next generation sequencing technologies in clinical practice. The Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance (MGHA) variant prioritization framework employs a gene prioritization index based on clinician-generated a priori gene lists, and a variant prioritization index (VPI) based on rarity, conservation and protein effect. We used data from 80 patients who underwent singleton whole exome sequencing (WES) to test the ability of the framework to rank causative variants highly, and compared it against the performance of other gene and variant prioritization tools. Causative variants were identified in 59 of the patients. Using the MGHA prioritization framework the average rank of the causative variant was 2.24, with 76% ranked as the top priority variant, and 90% ranked within the top five. Using clinician-generated gene lists resulted in ranking causative variants an average of 8.2 positions higher than prioritization based on variant properties alone. This clinically driven prioritization approach significantly outperformed purely computational tools, placing a greater proportion of causative variants top or in the top 5 (permutation P-value = 0.001). Clinicians included 40 of the 49 WES diagnoses in their a priori list of differential diagnoses (81%). The lists generated by PhenoTips and Phenomizer contained 14 (29%) and 18 (37%) of these diagnoses respectively. These results highlight the benefits of clinically led variant prioritization in increasing the efficiency of singleton WES data analysis and have important implications for developing models for the funding and delivery of genomic services.

AB  - BackgroundThe assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) is a powerful method to examine chromatin accessibility. While many studies have reported a positive correlation between gene expression and promoter accessibility, few have investigated the genes that deviate from this trend. In this study, we aimed to understand the relationship between gene expression and promoter accessibility in multiple cell types while also identifying gene regulatory networks in the placenta, an understudied organ that is critical for a successful pregnancy.ResultsWe started by assaying the open chromatin landscape in the mid-gestation placenta, when the fetal vasculature has started developing. After incorporating transcriptomic data generated in the placenta at the same time point, we grouped genes based on their expression levels and ATAC-seq promoter coverage. We found that the genes with the strongest correlation (high expression and high coverage) are likely involved in housekeeping functions, whereas tissue-specific genes were highly expressed and had only medium-low coverage. We also predicted that genes with medium-low expression and high promoter coverage were actively repressed. Within this group, we extracted a protein-protein interaction network enriched for neuronal functions, likely preventing the cells from adopting a neuronal fate. We further confirmed that a repressive histone mark is bound to the promoters of genes in this network. Finally, we ran our pipeline using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data generated in ten additional cell types. We again found that genes with the strongest correlation are enriched for housekeeping functions and that genes with medium-low promoter coverage and high expression are more likely to be tissue-specific. These results demonstrate that only two data types, both of which require relatively low starting material to generate and are becoming more commonly available, can be integrated to understand multiple aspects of gene regulation.ConclusionsWithin the placenta, we identified an active placenta-specific gene network as well as a repressed neuronal network. Beyond the placenta, we demonstrate that ATAC-seq data and RNA-seq data can be integrated to identify tissue-specific genes and actively repressed gene networks in multiple cell types.

AB  - Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithms associate gene expression with biological processes (e.g. time-course dynamics or disease subtypes). Compared with univariate associations, the relative weights of NMF solutions can obscure biomarkers. Therefore, we developed a novel patternMarkers statistic to extract genes for biological validation and enhanced visualization of NMF results. Finding novel and unbiased gene markers with patternMarkers requires whole-genome data. Therefore, we also developed Genome-Wide CoGAPS Analysis in Parallel Sets (GWCoGAPS), the first robust whole genome Bayesian NMF using the sparse, MCMC algorithm, CoGAPS. Additionally, a manual version of the GWCoGAPS algorithm contains analytic and visualization tools including patternMatcher, a Shiny web application. The decomposition in the manual pipeline can be replaced with any NMF algorithm, for further generalization of the software. Using these tools, we find granular brain-region and cell-type specific signatures with corresponding biomarkers in GTEx data, illustrating GWCoGAPS and patternMarkers ascertainment of data-driven biomarkers from whole-genome data. Availability and Implementation: PatternMarkers & GWCoGAPS are in the CoGAPS Bioconductor package (3.5) under the GPL license.

AB  - Tourette Disorder (TD) is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the presence of both motor and vocal tics. The genetic architecture of TD is believed to be complex and heterogeneous. Nevertheless, DNA sequence variants co-segregating with TD phenotypes within multiplex families have been identified. This report examines whole exomes of affected and unaffected individuals in a multiplex TD family to discover genes involved in the TD etiology. We performed whole exome sequencing on six out of nine members in a three-generation TD multiplex family. Putative deleterious sequence variants co-segregating with TD patients were identified by our in-house bioinformatics pipeline. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from one unaffected and two TD affected individuals. Neurons were derived from the iPSCs and biochemical assays were conducted to evaluate possible molecular differences between affected and unaffected. A rare heterozygous nonsense mutation in PNKD was co-segregated with TD in this multiplex family. Transcript and protein levels of the PNKD long isoform were reduced in neurons derived from the individuals with TD due to the nonsense mutation, indicating nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. We demonstrated that the PNKD long isoform monomer oligomerizes with itself as well as interacts with the synaptic active zone protein RIMS1 alpha. We concluded that reduced PNKD long isoform levels are detected in all affected individuals and we provide evidence for a mechanism whereby this might contribute to the TD phenotype.

AB  - Motivation: Genomic sequencing studies, including RNA sequencing and bisulfite sequencing studies, are becoming increasingly common and increasingly large. Large genomic sequencing studies open doors for accurate molecular trait heritability estimation and powerful differential analysis. Heritability estimation and differential analysis in sequencing studies requires the development of statistical methods that can properly account for the count nature of the sequencing data and that are computationally efficient for large datasets. Results: Here, we develop such a method, PQLseq (Penalized Quasi-Likelihood for sequencing count data), to enable effective and efficient heritability estimation and differential analysis using the generalized linear mixed model framework. With extensive simulations and comparisons to previous methods, we show that PQLseq is the only method currently available that can produce unbiased heritability estimates for sequencing count data. In addition, we show that PQLseq is well suited for differential analysis in large sequencing studies, providing calibrated type I error control and more power compared to the standard linear mixed model methods. Finally, we apply PQLseq to perform gene expression heritability estimation and differential expression analysis in a large RNA sequencing study in the Hutterites.

AB  - MiRNAs regulate the expression of target genes in diverse cellular processes and hence play important roles in different physiological processes, yet little is known about the stomach microRNAome (miRNAome) of the Tibetan pig. The objective of this experiment was to investigate differentially expressed stomach miRNAs participating in digestion. Firstly, we isolated total RNA by Trizol reagent from three Tibetan and three Yorkshire purebred pigs stomach samples at 90-day-old. Secondly, a comprehensive analysis of Tibetan and Yorkshire pig stomach miRNAomes was performed by small RNA sequencing in the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Finally, SYBR Green Real-time RT-PCR was performed to validate the differentially expressed miRNAs. We identified 318 unique miRNAs, 260 were co-expressed in both libraries, 17 and 31 miRNAs were specifically expressed in Tibetan and Yorkshire pigs respectively. Fifty six differentially expressed miRNAs were identified by the identifying differentially expressed genes 6 (IDEG6). Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis revealed that some of the differentially expressed miRNAs were associated with protein and fat digestion. Two differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-214-3p and ssc-un39) participating in the digestion of lipid were identified. Additionally, qRT-PCR results suggested that a higher expression of miR-214-3p in the Tibetan pig stomach could lead to relatively lower expression of calcium-dependent phospholipase A2, which is an enzyme important for the digestion of glycerol phospholipid. This study has delineated the different stomach miRNAs expression patterns of Tibetan and Yorkshire pigs, which would help explain the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in digestion of Tibetan pigs, and contribute to utilize a the unique digestion merits of Tibetan pig in future porcine hybridization breeding.

AB  - Background: Sorted merging of genomic data is a common data operation necessary in many sequencing-based studies. It involves sorting and merging genomic data from different subjects by their genomic locations. In particular, merging a large number of variant call format (VCF) files is frequently required in large-scale whole-genome sequencing or whole-exome sequencing projects. Traditional single-machine based methods become increasingly inefficient when processing large numbers of files due to the excessive computation time and Input/Output bottleneck. Distributed systems and more recent cloud-based systems offer an attractive solution. However, carefully designed and optimized workflow patterns and execution plans (schemas) are required to take full advantage of the increased computing power while overcoming bottlenecks to achieve high performance. Findings: In this study, we custom-design optimized schemas for three Apache big data platforms, Hadoop (MapReduce), HBase, and Spark, to perform sorted merging of a large number of VCF files. These schemas all adopt the divide-and-conquer strategy to split the merging job into sequential phases/stages consisting of subtasks that are conquered in an ordered, parallel, and bottleneck-free way. In two illustrating examples, we test the performance of our schemas on merging multiple VCF files into either a single TPED or a single VCF file, which are benchmarked with the traditional single/parallel multiway-merge methods, message passing interface (MPI)-based high-performance computing (HPC) implementation, and the popular VCFTools. Conclusions: Our experiments suggest all three schemas either deliver a significant improvement in efficiency or render much better strong and weak scalabilities over traditional methods. Our findings provide generalized scalable schemas for performing sorted merging on genetics and genomics data using these Apache distributed systems.

AB  - Background Heterogeneity of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) has been characterized using whole-genome mRNA expression data, showing distinct molecular and clinicopathological characteristics by subtypes. However, associations between risk factors and molecular subtypes have not been reported. Methods Four previously published schemes were used to categorize molecular subtypes in 372 MIBC patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Data on gene expression (RNA-seq), demographic, and clinicopathological characteristics were retrieved through TCGA data portal. Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate the associations of subtypes by different schemes with age at diagnosis, obesity, and smoking. Results While some quantitative variation was evident, distinct molecular subtype schemes showed considerable consistency in the association with the risk factors. Generally, compared to patients with luminal-like tumors, patients with basal-like subtypes were more likely to be older (OR75 + yrs vs. < 60 years range = 1.32-2.89), obese (ORobese vs. normal range = 1.30-3.05), and to start smoking at early age (OR < 18 years vs. 25+ years range = 1.11-4.57). Conclusions Different molecular subtypes of MIBC may have distinct risk profiles. Large population-based studies with detailed information on bladder cancer risk factors are needed to further define etiologic heterogeneity for bladder cancer.

AB  - Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a large class of gene transcripts with regulatory functions discovered in recent years. Many more are expected to be revealed with accumulation of RNA-seq data from diverse types of normal and diseased tissues. However, discovering novel lncRNAs and accurately quantifying known lncRNAs is not trivial from massive RNA-seq data. Herein we describe UClncR, an Ultrafast and Comprehensive lncRNA detection pipeline to tackle the challenge. UClncR takes standard RNA-seq alignment file, performs transcript assembly, predicts lncRNA candidates, quantifies and annotates both known and novel lncRNA candidates, and generates a convenient report for downstream analysis. The pipeline accommodates both un-stranded and stranded RNA-seq so that lncRNAs overlapping with other genes can be predicted and quantified. UClncR is fully parallelized in a cluster environment yet allows users to run samples sequentially without a cluster. The pipeline can process a typical RNA-seq sample in a matter of minutes and complete hundreds of samples in a matter of hours. Analysis of predicted lncRNAs from two test datasets demonstrated UClncR's accuracy and their relevance to sample clinical phenotypes. UClncR would facilitate researchers' novel lncRNA discovery significantly and is publically available at http://bioinformaticstools.mayo. edu/research/UClncR.

AB  - High throughput sequencing (HTS) is useful for many purposes as exemplified by the other topics included in this special issue. The purpose of this paper is to look into the unique challenges of using this technology in non-model organisms where resources such as genomes, functional genome annotations or genome complexity provide obstacles not met,in model organisms. To describe these challenges, we narrow our scope to RNA sequencing used to study differential gene expression in response to pathogen challenge. As a demonstration species we chose Atlantic salmon, which has a sequenced genome with poor annotation and an added complexity due to many duplicated genes. We find that our RNA-seq analysis pipeline deciphers between duplicates despite high sequence identity. However, annotation issues provide problems in linking differentially expressed genes to pathways. Also, comparing results between approaches and species are complicated due to, lack of standardized annotation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Testing of patients with genetics-related disorders is in progress of shifting from single gene assays to gene panel sequencing, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Since WGS is unquestionably becoming a new foundation for molecular analyses, we decided to compare three currently used tools for variant calling of human whole genome sequencing data. We tested DeepVariant, a new TensorFlow machine learning-based variant caller, and compared this tool to GATK 4.0 and SpeedSeq, using 30x, 15x and 10x WGS data of the well-known NA12878 DNA reference sample. According to our comparison, the performance on SNV calling was almost similar in 30x data, with all three variant callers reaching F-Scores (i.e. harmonic mean of recall and precision) equal to 0.98. In contrast, DeepVariant was more precise in indel calling than GATK and SpeedSeq, as demonstrated by F-Scores of 0.94, 0.90 and 0.84, respectively. We conclude that the DeepVariant tool has great potential and usefulness for analysis of WGS data in medical genetics.

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an established and powerful method to investigate transcriptomic cell-to-cell variation, thereby revealing new cell types and providing insights into developmental processes and transcriptional stochasticity. A key question is how the variety of available protocols compare in terms of their ability to detect and accurately quantify gene expression. Here, we assessed the protocol sensitivity and accuracy of many published data sets, on the basis of spike-in standards and uniform data processing. For our workflow, we developed a flexible tool for counting the number of unique molecular identifiers (https://github.com/vals/umis/). We compared 15 protocols computationally and 4 protocols experimentally for batch-matched cell populations, in addition to investigating the effects of spike-in molecular degradation. Our analysis provides an integrated framework for comparing scRNA-seq protocols.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Conjunctival melanoma (CM) is a highly aggressive ocular cancer for which treatment options are limited; the molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE To identify the molecular characteristics of CM using next-generation whole-exome sequencing (WES). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Whole-exome sequencing was performed on tumor DNA extracted from the archived specimens of 5 patients with CM who had been treated with surgical excision between 2006 and 2011. These samples were analyzed at a tertiary academic ocular oncology referral center using a customized bioinformatic pipeline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sample analyses were designed to detect driver mutations, chromosome copy number aberrations, and mutation signatures. RESULTS The study's 5 patients ranged in age from 51 to 77 years. Four of the 5 were female, and all were white. Mutations were detected in known oncogenes, including BRAF, NRAS, NF1, EGFR, ALK, TERT, and APC. None of the mutations associated with uveal melanoma were found. All samples demonstrated a C -> T mutation signature typical of UV-induced DNA damage. The most common CNA was a gain in chromosome 6p. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In these 5 patients, WES allowed identification of mutations that can be targeted with therapy and supported the role of UV light in CM pathogenesis. These findings indicate a need for larger studies to evaluate the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value of WES for CM.

AB  - RNAcentral is a comprehensive database of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences, collating information on ncRNA sequences of all types from a broad range of organisms. We have recently added a new genome mapping pipeline that identifies genomic locations for ncRNA sequences in 296 species. We have also added several new types of functional annotations, such as tRNA secondary structures, Gene Ontology annotations, and miRNA-target interactions. A new quality control mechanism based on Rfam family assignments identifies potential contamination, incomplete sequences, and more. The RNAcentral database has become a vital component of many workflows in the RNA community, serving as both the primary source of sequence data for academic and commercial groups, as well as a source of stable accessions for the annotation of genomic and functional features. These examples are facilitated by an improved RNAcentral web interface, which features an updated genome browser, a new sequence feature viewer, and improved text search functionality. RNAcentral is freely available at https://rnacentral.org.

AB  - The improvement of sequencing technologies has facilitated generalization of metagenomic sequencing, which has become a standard procedure for analyzing the structure and functionality of microbiomes. Bioinformatic analysis of sequencing results poses a challenge because it involves many different complex steps. SqueezeMeta is a fully automatic pipeline for metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, covering all steps of the analysis. SqueezeMeta includes multi-metagenome support that enables co-assembly of related metagenomes and retrieval of individual genomes via binning procedures. SqueezeMeta features several unique characteristics: co-assembly procedure or coassembly of unlimited number of metagenomes via merging of individual assembled metagenomes, both with read mapping for estimation of the abundances of genes in each metagenome. It also includes binning and bin checking for retrieving individual genomes. Internal checks for the assembly and binning steps provide information about the consistency of contigs and bins. Moreover, results are stored in a MySQL database, where they can be easily exported and shared, and can be inspected anywhere using a flexible web interface that allows simple creation of complex queries. We illustrate the potential of SqueezeMeta by analyzing 32 gut metagenomes in a fully automatic way, enabling retrieval of several million genes and several hundreds of genomic bins. One of the motivations in the development of SqueezeMeta was producing a software capable of running in small desktop computers and thus amenable to all users and settings. We were also able to co-assemble two of these metagenomes and complete the full analysis in less than one day using a simple laptop computer. This reveals the capacity of SqueezeMeta to run without high-performance computing infrastructure and in absence of any network connectivity. It is therefore adequate for in situ, real time analysis of metagenomes produced by nanopore sequencing. SqueezeMeta can be downloaded from https://github.com/jtamames/SqueezeMeta.

AB  - Despite modest sequence conservation and rapid evolution, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) appear to be conserved in expression pattern and function. However, analysis of lncRNAs across tissues and developmental stages remains largely uncharacterized in mammals. Here, we systematically investigated the lncRNAs of the Guizhou miniature pig (Sus scrofa), which was widely used as biomedical model. We performed RNA sequencing across 9 organs and 3 developmental skeletal muscle, and developed a filtering pipeline to identify 10,813 lncRNAs (9,075 novel). Conservation patterns analysis revealed that 57% of pig lncRNAs showed homology to humans and mice based on genome alignment. 5,455 lncRNAs exhibited typical hallmarks of regulatory molecules, such as high spatio-temporal specificity. Notably, conserved lncRNAs exhibited higher tissue specificity than pig-specific lncRNAs and were significantly enriched in testis and ovary. Weighted co-expression network analysis revealed a set of conserved lncRNAs that are likely involved in postnatal muscle development. Based on the high degree of similarity in the structure, organization, and dynamic expression of pig lncRNAs compared with human and mouse lncRNAs, we propose that these lncRNAs play an important role in organ physiology and development in mammals. Our results provide a resource for studying animal evolution, morphological complexity, breeding, and biomedical research.

AB  - High-throughput sequencing of full-length transcripts using long reads has paved the way for the discovery of thousands of novel transcripts, even in well-annotated mammalian species. The advances in sequencing technology have created a need for studies and tools that can characterize these novel variants. Here, we present SQANTI, an automated pipeline for the classification of long-read transcripts that can assess the quality of data and the preprocessing pipeline using 47 unique descriptors. We apply SQANTI to a neuronal mouse transcriptome using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long reads and illustrate how the tool is effective in characterizing and describing the composition of the full-length transcriptome. We perform extensive evaluation of ToFU PacBio transcripts by PCR to reveal that an important number of the novel transcripts are technical artifacts of the sequencing approach and that SQANTI quality descriptors can be used to engineer a filtering strategy to remove them. Most novel transcripts in this curated transcriptome are novel combinations of existing splice sites, resulting more frequently in novel ORFs than novel UTRs, and are enriched in both general metabolic and neural-specific functions. We show that these new transcripts have a major impact in the correct quantification of transcript levels by state-of-the-art short-read-based quantification algorithms. By comparing our iso-transcriptome with public proteomics databases, we find that alternative isoforms are elusive to proteogenomics detection. SQANTI allows the user to maximize the analytical outcome of long-read technologies by providing the tools to deliver quality-evaluated and curated full-length transcriptomes.

AB  - Purpose: To identify the genetic basis for retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in a cohort of Jewish patients from Caucasia. Methods: Patients underwent a detailed ophthalmic evaluation, including funduscopic examination, visual field testing, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and electrophysiological tests, electroretinography (ERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Genetic analysis was performed with a combination of whole exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis of the WES results was performed via a customized pipeline. Pathogenicity of the identified intronic variant was evaluated in silico using the web tool Human Splicing Finder, and in vitro, using a minigene-based splicing assay. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was used to demonstrate a founder effect, and the decay of LD over generations around the mutation in Caucasus Jewish chromosomes was modeled to estimate the age of the most recent common ancestor. Results: In eight patients with RP from six unrelated families, all of Caucasus Jewish ancestry, we identified a novel homozygous intronic variant, located at position -9 of PDE6B intron 15. The c.1921-9C>G variant was predicted to generate a novel acceptor splice site, nine bases upstream of the original splice site of intron 15. In vitro splicing assay demonstrated that this novel acceptor splice site is used instead of the wild-type site, leading to an 8-bp insertion into exon 16, which is predicted to cause a frameshift. The presence of a common ancestral haplotype in mutation-bearing chromosomes was compatible with a founder effect. Conclusions: The PDE6B c.1921-9C>G intronic mutation is a founder mutation that accounts for at least 40% (6/15 families) of autosomal recessive RP among Caucasus Jews. This result is highly important for molecular diagnosis, carrier screening, and genetic counseling in this population.

AB  - Systems biology is an integrative discipline connecting the molecular components within a single biological scale and also among different scales (e.g. cells, tissues and organ systems) to physiological functions and organismal phenotypes through quantitative reasoning, computational models and high-throughput experimental technologies. Systems biology uses a wide range of quantitative experimental and computational methodologies to decode information flow from genes, proteins and other subcellular components of signaling, regulatory and functional pathways to control cell, tissue, organ and organismal level functions. The computational methods used in systems biology provide systems-level insights to understand interactions and dynamics at various scales, within cells, tissues, organs and organisms. In recent years, the systems biology framework has enabled research in quantitative and systems pharmacology and precision medicine for complex diseases. Here, we present a brief overview of current experimental and computational methods used in systems biology.

AB  - Background: Observations of recurrent somatic mutations in tumors have led to identification and definition of signaling and other pathways that are important for cancer progression and therapeutic targeting. As tumor cells contain both an individual's inherited genetic variants and somatic mutations, challenges arise in distinguishing these events in massively parallel sequencing datasets. Typically, both a tumor sample and a "normal" sample from the same individual are sequenced and compared; variants observed only in the tumor are considered to be somatic mutations. However, this approach requires two samples for each individual. Results: We evaluate a method of detecting somatic mutations in tumor samples for which only a subset of normal samples are available. We describe tuning of the method for detection of mutations in tumors, filtering to remove inherited variants, and comparison of detected mutations to several matched tumor/normal analysis methods. Filtering steps include the use of population variation datasets to remove inherited variants as well a subset of normal samples to remove technical artifacts. We then directly compare mutation detection with tumor-only and tumor-normal approaches using the same sets of samples. Comparisons are performed using an internal targeted gene sequencing dataset (n = 3380) as well as whole exome sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas project (n = 250). Tumor-only mutation detection shows similar recall (43-60%) but lesser precision (20-21%) to current matched tumor/normal approaches (recall 43-73%, precision 30-82%) when compared to a "gold-standard" tumor/normal approach. The inclusion of a small pool of normal samples improves precision, although many variants are still uniquely detected in the tumor-only analysis. Conclusions: A detailed method for somatic mutation detection without matched normal samples enables study of larger numbers of tumor samples, as well as tumor samples for which a matched normal is not available. As sensitivity/recall is similar to tumor/normal mutation detection but precision is lower, tumor-only detection is more appropriate for classification of samples based on known mutations. Although matched tumor-normal analysis is preferred due to higher precision, we demonstrate that mutation detection without matched normal samples is possible for certain applications.

AB  - RNA-Seq is a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell and generates millions of short sequence fragments, reads, in a single run. These reads can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. One of the critical steps in an RNA-Seq experiment is mapping NGS reads to the reference genome. Because RNA-Seq reads can span over more than one exon in the genome, this task is challenging. In the last decade, tools for RNA-Seq alignment have emerged, but most of them run in two phases. First, the pipeline only maps reads that have a direct match in the reference, and the remaining are set aside as initially unmapped reads. Then, they use heuristics based approaches, clustering or even annotations, to decide where to align the later. This work presents an efficient computational solution for the problem of transcriptome alignment, named SpliceTAPyR. It identifies signals of splice junctions and relies on compressed full-text indexing methods and succinct data structures to efficiently align RNA-Seq reads in a single phase. This way it achieves the same or better accuracy than other tools while using considerably less memory and time to the most competitive tools.

AB  - Background: Transcriptome sequencing has become a method of choice for evolutionary studies in microbial eukaryotes due to low cost and minimal sample requirements. Transcriptome data has been extensively used in phylogenomic studies to infer ancient evolutionary histories. However, its utility in studying cryptic species diversity is not well explored. An empirical investigation was conducted to test the applicability of transcriptome data in resolving two major types of discordances at lower taxonomic levels. These include cases where species have the same morphology but different genetics (cryptic species) and species of different morphologies but have the same genetics. We built a species comparison bioinformatic pipeline that takes into account the nature of transcriptome data in amoeboid microbes exemplifying such discordances. Result: Our analyses of known or suspected cryptic species yielded consistent results regardless of the methods of culturing, RNA collection or sequencing. Over 95% of the single copy genes analyzed in samples of the same species sequenced using different methods and cryptic species had intra- and interspecific divergences below 2%. Only a minority of groups (2.91-4.87%) had high distances exceeding 2% in these taxa, which was likely caused by low data quality. This pattern was also observed in suspected genetically similar species with different morphologies. Transcriptome data consistently delineated all taxa above species level, including cryptically diverse species. Using our approach we were able to resolve cryptic species problems, uncover misidentification and discover new species. We also identified several potential barcode markers with varying evolutionary rates that can be used in lineages with different evolutionary histories. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that transcriptome data is appropriate for understanding cryptic species diversity in microbial eukaryotes.

AB  - There is a wide diversity of bioinformatic tools available for the assembly of next generation sequence and subsequence variant calling to identify genetic markers at scale. Integration of genomics tools such as genomic selection, association studies, pedigree analysis and analysis of genetic diversity, into operational breeding is a goal for New Zealand's most widely planted exotic tree species, Pinus radiata. In the absence of full reference genomes for large megagenomes such as in conifers, RNA sequencing in a range of genotypes and tissue types, offers a rich source of genetic markers for downstream application. We compared nine different assembler and variant calling software combinations in a single transcriptomic library and found that Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) discovery could vary by as much as an order of magnitude (8,061 SNPs up to 86,815 SNPs). The assembler with the best realignment of the packages trialled, Trinity, in combination with several variant callers was then applied to a much larger multi-genotype, multi-tissue transcriptome and identified 683,135 in silico SNPs across a predicted 449,951 exons when mapped to the Pinus taeda ver 1.01e reference.

AB  - Brown algae have evolved complex multicellularity in the heterokont lineage. They are phylogenetically distant to land plants, fungi and animals. Especially, the members of Laminariales (so-called kelps) have developed highly differentiated tissues. Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays pivotal roles in a number of essential processes in multicellular organisms, such as cell adhesion, cell and tissue differentiations, cell-to-cell communication, and responses to environmental stimuli. In these processes, a set of extracellular secreted proteins called the secretome operates remodeling of the physicochemical nature of ECM and signal transduction by interacting with cell surface proteins and signaling molecules. Characterization of the secretome is a critical step to clarify the contributions of ECM to the multicellularity of brown algae. However, the identity of the brown algal secretome has been poorly understood. In order to reveal the repertory of the brown algal secretome and its involvement in the evolution of Laminariales, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of the brown algal secretome utilizing the published complete genome data of Ectocarpus siliculosus and Saccharina japonica as well as newly obtained RNA-seq data of seven laminarialean species (Agarum clathratum, Alaria crassifolia, Aureophycus aleuticus, Costaria costata, Pseudochorda nagaii, Saccharina angustata and Undaria pinnatlfida) largely covering the laminarialean families. We established the in silico pipeline to systematically and accurately detect the secretome by combining multiple prediction algorithms for the N-terminal signal peptide and transmembrane domain within the protein sequence. From 16,189 proteins of E. siliculosus and 18,733 proteins of S. japonica, 552 and 964 proteins respectively were predicted to be classified as the secretome. Conserved domain analysis showed that the domain repertory were very similar to each other, and that of the brown algal secretome was partially common with that of the secretome of other multicellular organisms (land plants, fungi and animals). In the laminarialean species, it was estimated that the gene abundance and the domain architecture of putative ECM remodeling-related proteins were altered compared with those of E. siliculosus, and that the alteration started from the basal group of Laminariales. These results suggested that brown algae have developed their own secretome, and its functions became more elaborated in the more derived members in Laminariales. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Today most population genomic studies of nonmodel organisms either sequence a subset of the genome deeply in each individual or sequence pools of unlabelled individuals. With a step-by-step workflow, we illustrate how lowcoverage whole-genome sequencing of hundreds of individually barcoded samples is now a practical alternative strategy for obtaining genomewide data on a population scale. We used a highly efficient protocol to generate high-quality libraries for similar to 6.5 USD from each of 876 Atlantic silversides (a teleost fish with a genome size similar to 730 Mb) that we sequenced to 1-4x genome coverage. In the absence of a reference genome, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline for mapping the genomic reads to a de novo assembled reference transcriptome. This provides an 'in silico' method for exome capture that avoids the complexities and expenses of using wet chemistry for target isolation. Using novel tools for analysis of low-coverage data, we extracted population allele frequencies, individual genotype likelihoods and polymorphism data for 2 504 335 SNPs across the exome for the 876 fish. To illustrate the use of the resulting data, we present a preliminary analysis of geographical patterns in the exome data and a comparison of complete mitochondrial genome sequences for each individual (constructed from the low-coverage data) that show population colonization patterns along the US east coast. With a total cost per sample of less than 50 USD (including sequencing) and ability to prepare 96 libraries in only 5 h, our approach adds a viable new option to the population genomics toolbox.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism is complex and it is unclear. Genetic testing such as microarray or sequencing was widely used to identify autism markers, but they are unsuccessful in several cases. The objective of this study is to identify causative variants of autism in two Thai families by using whole-exome sequencing technique. Whole-exome sequencing was performed with autism-affected children from two unrelated families. Each sample was sequenced on SOLiD 5500xl Genetic Analyzer system followed by combined bioinformatics pipeline including annotation and filtering process to identify candidate variants. Candidate variants were validated, and the segregation study with other family members was performed using Sanger sequencing. This study identified a possible causative variant for ASD, c. 2951G>A, in the FGD6 gene. We demonstrated the potential for ASD genetic variants associated with ASD using whole-exome sequencing and a bioinformatics filtering procedure. These techniques could be useful in identifying possible causative ASD variants, especially in cases in which variants cannot be identified by other techniques.

AB  - Background: Inference of gene regulatory network structures from RNA-Seq data is challenging due to the nature of the data, as measurements take the form of counts of reads mapped to a given gene. Here we present a model for RNA-Seq time series data that applies a negative binomial distribution for the observations, and uses sparse regression with a horseshoe prior to learn a dynamic Bayesian network of interactions between genes. We use a variational inference scheme to learn approximate posterior distributions for the model parameters. Results: The methodology is benchmarked on synthetic data designed to replicate the distribution of real world RNA-Seq data. We compare our method to other sparse regression approaches and find improved performance in learning directed networks. We demonstrate an application of our method to a publicly available human neuronal stem cell differentiation RNA-Seq time series data set to infer the underlying network structure. Conclusions: Our method is able to improve performance on synthetic data by explicitly modelling the statistical distribution of the data when learning networks from RNA-Seq time series. Applying approximate inference techniques we can learn network structures quickly with only moderate computing resources.

AB  - Background: The soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is one of the most devastating diseases limiting soybean production worldwide. It is known that small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), play important roles in regulating plant growth and development, defense against pathogens, and responses to environmental changes. Results: In order to understand the role of soybean miRNAs during SCN infection, we analyzed 24 small RNA libraries including three biological replicates from two soybean cultivars (SCN susceptible KS4607, and SCN HG Type 7 resistant KS4313N) that were grown under SCN-infested and -noninfested soil at two different time points (SCN feeding establishment and egg production). In total, 537 known and 70 putative novel miRNAs in soybean were identified from a total of 0.3 billion reads (average about 13.5 million reads for each sample) with the programs of Bowtie and miRDeep2 mapper. Differential expression analyses were carried out using edgeR to identify miRNAs involved in the soybean-SCN interaction. Comparative analysis of miRNA profiling indicated a total of 60 miRNAs belonging to 25 families that might be specifically related to cultivar responses to SCN. Quantitative RT-PCR validated similar miRNA interaction patterns as sequencing results. Conclusion: These findings suggest that miRNAs are likely to play key roles in soybean response to SCN. The present work could provide a framework for miRNA functional identification and the development of novel approaches for improving soybean SCN resistance in future studies.

AB  - Background: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an orphan disease that is difficult to treat using traditional chemotherapy, an approach which has been effective in other types of cancer. Most chemotherapeutics cause DNA damage leading to cell death. Recent discoveries have highlighted a potential role for the p53 tumor suppressor in this disease. Given the pivotal role of p53 in the DNA damage response, here we investigated the predictive power of the p53 interactome model for MPM patients' stratification. Methods: We used bioinformatics approaches including omics type analysis of data from MPM cells and from MPM patients in order to predict which pathways are crucial for patients' survival. Analysis of the PKT206 model of the p53 network was validated by microarrays from the Mero-14 MPM cell line and RNA-seq data from 71 MPM patients, whilst statistical analysis was used to identify the deregulated pathways and predict therapeutic schemes by linking the affected pathway with the patients' clinical state. Results: In silico simulations demonstrated successful predictions ranging from 52 to 85% depending on the drug, algorithm or sample used for validation. Clinical outcomes of individual patients stratified in three groups and simulation comparisons identified 30 genes that correlated with survival. In patients carrying wild-type p53 either treated or not treated with chemotherapy, FEN1 and MMP2 exhibited the highest inverse correlation, whereas in untreated patients bearing mutated p53, SIAH1 negatively correlated with survival. Numerous repositioned and experimental drugs targeting FEN1 and MMP2 were identified and selected drugs tested. Epinephrine and myricetin, which target FEN1, have shown cytotoxic effect on Mero-14 cells whereas marimastat and batimastat, which target MMP2 demonstrated a modest but significant inhibitory effect on MPM cell migration. Finally, 8 genes displayed correlation with disease stage, which may have diagnostic implications. Conclusions: Clinical decisions related to MPM personalized therapy based on individual patients' genetic profile and previous chemotherapeutic treatment could be reached using computational tools and the predictions reported in this study upon further testing in animal models.

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows researchers to profile the transcriptomes of thousands of cells simultaneously. Protocols that incorporate both designed and random barcodes have greatly increased the throughput of scRNA-seq, but give rise to a more complex data structure. There is a need for new tools that can handle the various barcoding strategies used by different protocols and exploit this information for quality assessment at the sample-level and provide effective visualization of these results in preparation for higher-level analyses. To this end, we developed scPipe, an R/Bioconductor package that integrates barcode demultiplexing, read alignment, UMI-aware gene-level quantification and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple protocols that include CEL-seq, MARS-seq, Chromium 10X, Drop-seq and Smart-seq. scPipe produces a count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with an HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing. scPipe performs this processing in a few simple R commands, promoting reproducible analysis of single-cell data that is compatible with the emerging suite of open-source scRNA-seq analysis tools available in R/Bioconductor and beyond. The scPipe R package is available for download from https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/scPipe.

AB  - Key message We deeply investigated the mechanism underlying metabolic regulation in response to consecutive monoculture (replanting disease) and different abiotic stresses that unfolded the response mechanism to consecutive monoculture problem through RNA-seq analysis. The consecutive monoculture problem (CMP) resulted of complex environmental stresses mediated by multiple factors. Previous studies have noted that multiple stress factors in consecutive monoculture soils or plants severely limited the interpretation of the critical molecular mechanism, and made a predict that the specifically responding factor was autotoxic allelochemicals. To identify the specifically responding genes, we compared transcriptome changes in roots of Rehamannia glutinosa Libosch using consecutive monoculture, salt, drought, and ferulic acid as stress factors. Comparing with normal growth, 2502, 2672, 2485, and 1956 genes were differentially expressed in R. glutinosa under consecutive monoculture practice, salt, drought, and ferulic acid stress, respectively. In addition, 510 genes were specifically expressed under consecutive monoculture, which were not present under the other stress conditions. Integrating the biological and enrichment analyses of the differentially expressed genes, the result demonstrated that the plants could alter enzyme genes expression to reconstruct the complicated metabolic pathways, which used to tolerate the CMP and abiotic stresses. Furthermore, most of the affected pathway genes were closely related to secondary metabolic processes, and the influence of consecutive monoculture practice on the transcriptome genes expression profile was very similar to the profile under salt stress and then to the profile under drought stress. The outlined schematic diagram unfolded the putative signal regulation mechanism in response to the CMP. Genes that differentially up-or down-regulated under consecutive monoculture practice may play important roles in the CMP or replanting disease in R. glutinosa.

AB  - Rationale: Currently, there are no blood-based biomarkers with clinical utility for acute ischemic stroke (IS). MicroRNAs show promise as disease markers because of their cell type-specific expression patterns and stability in peripheral blood. Objective: To identify circulating microRNAs associated with acute IS, determine their temporal course up to 90 days post-stroke, and explore their utility as an early diagnostic marker. Methods and Results: We used RNA sequencing to study expression changes of circulating microRNAs in a discovery sample of 20 patients with IS and 20 matched healthy control subjects. We further applied quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in independent samples for validation (40 patients with IS and 40 matched controls), replication (200 patients with IS, 100 healthy control subjects), and in 72 patients with transient ischemic attacks. Sampling of patient plasma was done immediately upon hospital arrival. We identified, validated, and replicated 3 differentially expressed microRNAs, which were upregulated in patients with IS compared with both healthy control subjects (miR-125a-5p [1.8-fold; P=1.5x10(-6)], miR-125b-5p [2.5-fold; P=5.6x10(-6)], and miR-143-3p [4.8-fold; P=7.8x10(-9)]) and patients with transient ischemic attack (miR-125a-5p: P=0.003; miR125b- 5p: P=0.003; miR-143-3p: P=0.005). Longitudinal analysis of expression levels up to 90 days after stroke revealed a normalization to control levels for miR-125b-5p and miR-143-3p starting at day 2 while miR-125a-5p remained elevated. Levels of all 3 microRNAs depended on platelet numbers in a platelet spike-in experiment but were unaffected by chemical hypoxia in Neuro2a cells and in experimental stroke models. In a random forest classification, miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-143-3p differentiated between healthy control subjects and patients with IS with an area under the curve of 0.90 (sensitivity: 85.6%; specificity: 76.3%), which was superior to multimodal cranial computed tomography obtained for routine diagnostics (sensitivity: 72.5%) and previously reported biomarkers of acute IS (neuron-specific enolase: area under the curve=0.69; interleukin 6: area under the curve=0.82). Conclusions: A set of circulating microRNAs (miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-143-3p) associates with acute IS and might have clinical utility as an early diagnostic marker.

AB  - Geoduck clams (Panopea generosa) are an increasingly important fishery and aquaculture product along the eastern Pacific coast from Baja California, Mexico, to Alaska. These long-lived clams are highly fecund, although sustainable hatchery production of genetically diverse larvae is hindered by the lack of sexual dimorphism, resulting in asynchronous spawning of broodstock, unequal sex ratios, and low numbers of breeders. The development of assays of gonad physiology could indicate sex and maturation stage as well as be used to assess the status of natural populations. Proteomic profiles were determined for three reproductive maturation stages in both male and female clams using data-dependent acquisition (DDA) of gonad proteins. Gonad proteomes became increasingly divergent between males and females as maturation progressed. The DDA data were used to develop targets analyzed with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in gonad tissue as well as hemolymph. The SRM assay yielded a suite of indicator peptides that can be used as an efficient assay to determine geoduck gonad maturation status. Application of SRM in hemolymph samples demonstrates that this procedure could effectively be used to assess reproductive status in marine mollusks in a nonlethal manner.

AB  - Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are integrated retroviral elements that make up 8% of the human genome. However, the impact of ERVs on human health and disease is not well understood. While select ERVs have been implicated in diseases, including autoimmune disease and cancer, the lack of tools to analyze genome-wide, locus-specific expression of proviral autonomous ERVs has hampered the progress in the field. Here we describe a method called ERVmap, consisting of an annotated database of 3,220 human proviral ERVs and a pipeline that allows for locus-specific genome-wide identification of proviral ERVs that are transcribed based on RNA-sequencing data, and provide examples of the utility of this tool. Using ERVmap, we revealed cell-type-specific ERV expression patterns in commonly used cell lines as well as in primary cells. We identified 124 unique ERV loci that are significantly elevated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus that represent an IFN-independent signature. Finally, we identified additional tumor-associated ERVs that correlate with cytolytic activity represented by granzyme and perforin expression in breast cancer tissue samples. The open-source code of ERVmap and the accompanied web tool are made publicly available to quantify proviral ERVs in RNA-sequencing data with ease. Use of ERVmap across a range of diseases and experimental conditions has the potential to uncover novel disease-associated antigens and effectors involved in human health that is currently missed by focusing on protein-coding sequences.

AB  - Background: Macrophages play a key role in peripheral nerve repair and demonstrate complex phenotypes that are Highly dependent on microenvironmental cues. Methods: We determined temporal changes in macrophage gene expression over time using RNA sequencing after fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) macrophage populations from injured peripheral nerve. We identified key upstream regulators and dominant pathways using ingenuity pathway analysis and confirmed these changes with NanoString technology. We then investigate the effects of extreme polarizers of macrophage phenotype (IL4 and IFN gamma) on nerve regeneration. We determined macrophage gene expression in vivo at the site of peripheral nerve injury with NanoString technology, and assessed recovery from sciatic nerve injury by cranial tibial muscle weights and retrograde labeling motor neurons in mice with deletion of IL4 or IFN gamma receptors. Results: We demonstrate that IL4R and IFN gamma R deletions provide complementary responses to polarization, and alter expression of genes associated with angiogenesis and axonal extension, but do not influence recovery from peripheral nerve transection at 8 weeks after repair. Conclusions: Overall, this study provides a framework to evaluate the phenotype of macrophages over time, and provides a broader and more precise assessment of gene expression changes than has previously been commonly used. This data suggests ways in which polarization may be modulated to improve repair.

AB  - Taimen (Hucho taimen) is an important ecological and economic species that is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species; however, limited genomic information is available on this species. RNA-Seq is a useful tool for obtaining genetic information and developing genetic markers for nonmodel species in addition to its application in gene expression profiling. In this study, we performed a comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis of taimen. We obtained 157M clean reads (14.7Gb) and used them to de novo assemble a high-quality transcriptome with a N50 size of 1,060bp. In the assembly, 82% of the transcripts were annotated using several databases, and 14,666 of the transcripts contained a full open reading frame. The assembly covered 75% of the transcripts of Atlantic salmon and 57.3% of the protein-coding genes of rainbow trout. To learn about the genome evolution, we performed a systematic comparative analysis across 11 teleosts including eight salmonids and found 313 unique gene families in taimen. Using Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout transcriptomes as the background, we identified 250 positive selection transcripts. The pathway enrichment analysis revealed a unique characteristic of taimen: It possesses more immune-related genes than Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout; moreover, some genes have undergone strong positive selection. We also developed a pipeline for identifying microsatellite marker genotypes in samples and successfully identified 24 polymorphic microsatellite markers for taimen. These data and tools are useful for studying conservation genetics, phylogenetics, evolution among salmonids, and selective breeding for threatened taimen.

AB  - Leishmania braziliensis is the etiological agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disease with high public health importance, affecting 12 million people worldwide. Although its genome sequence was originally published in 2007, the two reference public annotations still presents at least 80% of the genes simply classified as hypothetical or putative proteins. Furthermore, it is notable the absence of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences from Leishmania species in public databases. These poorly annotated coding genes and ncRNAs could be important players for the understanding of this protozoan biology, the mechanisms behind host-parasite interactions and disease control. Herein, we performed a new prediction and annotation of L. braziliensis protein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs, using recently developed predictive algorithms and updated databases. In summary, we identified 11 491 ORFs, with 5263 (45.80%) of them associated with proteins available in public databases. Moreover, we identified for the first time the repertoire of 11 243 ncRNAs belonging to different classes distributed along the genome. The accuracy of our predictions was verified by transcriptional evidence using RNA-seq, confirming that they are actually generating real transcripts. These data were organized in a public repository named LeishDB (www.leishdb.com), which represents an improvement on the publicly available data related to genomic annotation for L. braziliensis. This updated information can be useful for future genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics studies; being an additional tool for genome annotation pipelines and novel studies associated with the understanding of this protozoan genome complexity, organization, biology, and development of innovative methodologies for disease control and diagnostics.

AB  - Immortalized cell lines are widely used to study the effectiveness and toxicity of anti cancer drugs as well as to assess the phenotypic characteristics of cancer cells, such as proliferation and migration ability. Unfortunately, cell lines often show extremely different properties than tumor tissues. Also the primary cells, that are deprived of the in vivo environment, might adapt to artificial conditions, and differ from the tissue they should represent. Despite these considerations, cell lines are still one of the most used cancer models due to their availability and capability to expand without limitation, but the clinical relevance of their use is still a big issue in cancer research. Many studies tried to overcome this task, comparing cell lines and tumor samples through the definition of the genomic and transcriptomic differences. To this aim, most of them used nucleotide variation or gene expression data. Here we introduce a different strategy based on alternative splicing detection and integration of DNA and RNA sequencing data, to explore the differences between immortalized and tissue-derived cells at isoforms level. Furthermore, in order to better investigate the heterogeneity of both cell populations, we took advantage of a public available dataset obtained with a new simultaneous omics single cell sequencing methodology. The proposed pipeline allowed us to identify, through a computational and prediction approach, putative mutated and alternative spliced transcripts responsible for the dissimilarity between immortalized and primary hepato carcinoma cells.

AB  - Any single nucleotide variant detection study could benefit from a fast and cheap method of measuring the quality of variant call list. It is advantageous to be able to see how the call list quality is affected by different variant filtering thresholds and other adjustments to the study parameters. Here we look into a possibility of estimating the proportion of true positives in a single nucleotide variant call list for human data. Using whole-exome and whole-genome gold standard data sets for training, we focus on building a generic model that only relies on information available from any variant caller. We assess and compare the performance of different candidate models based on their practical accuracy. We find that the generic model delivers decent accuracy most of the time. Further, we conclude that its performance could be improved substantially by leveraging the variant quality metrics that are specific to each variant calling tool.

BALDR was accurate for clonotype identification in human and rhesus macaque influenza vaccine and simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine induced vaccine-induced plasmablasts and naive and antigen-specific memory B cells. BALDR enables matching of clonotype identity with single-cell transcriptional information in B cell lineages and will have broad application in the fields of vaccines, human immunodeficiency virus broadly neutralizing antibody development, and cancer.

AB  - Motivation: In recent years, Transposable Elements (TEs) have been related to gene regulation. However, estimating the origin of expression of TEs through RNA-seq is complicated by multi-mapping reads coming from their repetitive sequences. Current approaches that address multi-mapping reads are focused in expression quantification and not in finding the origin of expression. Addressing the genomic origin of expressed TEs could further aid in understanding the role that TEs might have in the cell. Results: We have developed a new pipeline called TEcandidates, based on de novo transcriptome assembly to assess the instances of TEs being expressed, along with their location, to include in downstream DE analysis. TEcandidates takes as input the RNA-seq data, the genome sequence and the TE annotation file and returns a list of coordinates of candidate TEs being expressed, the TEs that have been removed and the genome sequence with removed TEs as masked. This masked genome is suited to include TEs in downstream expression analysis, as the ambiguity of reads coming from TEs is significantly reduced in the mapping step of the analysis.

AB  - Background: Cultivated chrysanthemum is an outcrossing hexaploid (2n = 6x = 54) with a disputed mode of inheritance. In this paper, we present a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection pipeline that was used to design an Affymetrix Axiom array with 183 k SNPs from RNA sequencing data (1). With this array, we genotyped four bi-parental populations (with sizes of 405, 53, 76 and 37 offspring plants respectively), and a cultivar panel of 63 genotypes. Further, we present a method for dosage scoring in hexaploids from signal intensities of the array based on mixture models (2) and validation of selection steps in the SNP selection pipeline (3). The resulting genotypic data is used to draw conclusions on the mode of inheritance in chrysanthemum (4), and to make an inference on allelic expression bias (5). Results: With use of the mixture model approach, we successfully called the dosage of 73,936 out of 183,130 SNPs (40.4%) that segregated in any of the bi-parental populations. To investigate the mode of inheritance, we analysed markers that segregated in the large bi-parental population (n = 405). Analysis of segregation of duplex x nulliplex SNPs resulted in evidence for genome-wide hexasomic inheritance. This evidence was substantiated by the absence of strong linkage between markers in repulsion, which indicated absence of full disomic inheritance. We present the success rate of SNP discovery out of RNA sequencing data as affected by different selection steps, among which SNP coverage over genotypes and use of different types of sequence read mapping software. Genomic dosage highly correlated with relative allele coverage from the RNA sequencing data, indicating that most alleles are expressed according to their genomic dosage. Conclusions: The large population, genotyped with a very large number of markers, is a unique framework for extensive genetic analyses in hexaploid chrysanthemum. As starting point, we show conclusive evidence for genome-wide hexasomic inheritance.

AB  - Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) strategies, like RNA-Seq, have revealed the transcription of a wide variety of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the genomes of several organisms. In the present work we assessed the lncRNAs complement of Schistosoma mansoni, the blood fluke that causes schistosomiasis, ranked among the most prevalent parasitic diseases worldwide. We focused on the long intergenic/intervening ncRNAs (lincRNAs), hidden within the large amount of information obtained through RNA-Seq in S. mansoni (88 libraries). Our computational pipeline identified 7029 canonically-spliced putative lincRNA genes on 2596 genomic loci (at an average 2.7 isoforms per lincRNA locus), as well as 402 spliced lncRNAs that are antisense to protein-coding (PC) genes. Hundreds of lincRNAs showed traits for being functional, such as the presence of epigenetic marks at their transcription start sites, evolutionary conservation among other schistosome species and differential expression across five different life-cycle stages of the parasite. Real-time qPCR has confirmed the differential life-cycle stage expression of a set of selected lincRNAs. We have built PC gene and lincRNA co-expression networks, unraveling key biological processes where lincRNAs might be involved during parasite development. This is the first report of a large-scale identification and structural annotation of lncRNAs in the S. mansoni genome.

AB  - Motivation: The identification of genetic variants influencing gene expression (known as expression quantitative trait loci or eQTLs) is important in unravelling the genetic basis of complex traits. Detecting multiple eQTLs simultaneously in a population based on paired DNA-seq and RNA-seq assays employs two competing types of models: models which rely on appropriate transformations of RNA-seq data (and are powered by a mature mathematical theory), or count-based models, which represent digital gene expression explicitly, thus rendering such transformations unnecessary. The latter constitutes an immensely popular methodology, which is however plagued by mathematical intractability. Results: We develop tractable count-based models, which are amenable to efficient estimation through the introduction of latent variables and the appropriate application of recent statistical theory in a sparse Bayesian modelling framework. Furthermore, we examine several transformation methods for RNA-seq read counts and we introduce arcsin, logit and Laplace smoothing as preprocessing steps for transformation-based models. Using natural and carefully simulated data from the 1000 Genomes and gEUVADIS projects, we benchmark both approaches under a variety of scenarios, including the presence of noise and violation of basic model assumptions. We demonstrate that an arcsin transformation of Laplace-smoothed data is at least as good as state-of-the-art models, particularly at small samples. Furthermore, we show that an over-dispersed Poisson model is comparable to the celebrated Negative Binomial, but much easier to estimate. These results provide strong support for transformation-based versus count-based (particularly Negative-Binomial-based) models for eQTL mapping.

AB  - The plating coral, Agaricia lamarcki is a widely distributed species inhabiting reefs across the Caribbean basin and Florida. This species is of interest since it is considered a depth-generalist, found from 10 to 70 m. Given the scope of contemporary studies on this coral's population dynamics and physiology, as well as, the potential of mesophotic reefs to be refuge habitats for deteriorated shallow water reefs, we present the first de novo transcriptome assembly of an important mesophotic coral. Using next-generation paired-end sequencing (Illumina Hiseq4000; 2 x 150 bp), we obtained a total of 82,506,058 raw reads. The novel transcriptome assembly strategy included the recently developed National Center for Genome Analysis Support de novo transcriptome assembly pipeline. Assembly produced a total of 101,322 biologically true, non-redundant transcripts with an average contig length of 959 and N50 of 1830. Evidential Gene and TransDecoder were used to identify open reading frames (ORFs) with homology insight provided by the UniProtKb and PFAM databases. ORF prediction resulted in 38,517 putative ORFs of which 12,107 ORFs were annotated as genes dealing with molecular function, 1266 with biological processes and 416 with cellular components.

AB  - This metagenome approach is used to identify plant viruses with circular DNA genomes and their transcripts. Often plant DNA viruses that occur in low titers in their host or cannot be mechanically inoculated to another host are difficult to propagate to achieve a greater titer of infectious material. Infected leaves are ground in a mild buffer with optimal pH and ionic composition recommended for purifying most bacilliform Para retroviruses. Urea is used to break up inclusion bodies that trap virions and to dissolve cellular components. Differential centrifugation provides further separation of virions from plant contaminants. Then proteinase K treatment removes the capsids. Then the viral DNA is concentrated and used for next-generation sequencing (NGS). The NGS data are used to assemble contigs which are submitted to NCBI-BLASTn to identify a subset of virus sequences in the generated dataset. In a parallel pipeline, RNA is isolated from infected leaves using a standard column-based RNA extraction method. Then ribosome depletion is carried out to enrich for a subset of mRNA and virus transcripts. Assembled sequences derived from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were submitted to NCBI-BLASTn to identify a subset of virus sequences in this dataset. In our study, we identified two related full-length badnavirus genomes in the two datasets. This method is preferred to another common approach which extracts the aggregate population of small RNA sequences to reconstitute plant virus genomic sequences. This latter metagenomic pipeline recovers virus related sequences that are retro-transcribing elements inserted into the plant genome. This is coupled to biochemical or molecular assays to further discern the actively infectious agents. The approach documented in this study, recovers sequences representative of replicating viruses that likely indicate active virus infection.

AB  - Background: Fusarium circinatum is a pressing threat to the cultivation of many economically important pine tree species. Efforts to develop effective disease management strategies can be aided by investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in the host-pathogen interaction between F. circinatum and pine species. Pinus tecunumanii and Pinus patula are two closely related tropical pine species that differ widely in their resistance to F. circinatum challenge, being resistant and susceptible respectively, providing the potential for a useful pathosystem to investigate the molecular responses underlying resistance to F. circinatum. However, no genomic resources are available for P. tecunumanii. Pathogenesis-related proteins are classes of proteins that play important roles in plant-microbe interactions, e.g. chitinases; proteins that break down the major structural component of fungal cell walls. Generating a reference sequence for P. tecunumanii and characterizing pathogenesis related gene families in these two pine species is an important step towards unravelling the pine-F. circinatum interaction. Results: Eight reference based and 12 de novo assembled transcriptomes were produced, for juvenile shoot tissue from both species. EvidentialGene pipeline redundancy reduction, expression filtering, protein clustering and taxonomic filtering produced a 50 Mb shoot transcriptome consisting of 28,621 contigs for P. tecunumanii and a 72 Mb shoot transcriptome consisting of 52,735 contigs for P. patula. Predicted protein sequences encoded by the assembled transcriptomes were clustered with reference proteomes from 92 other species to identify pathogenesis related gene families in P. patula, P. tecunumanii and other pine species. Conclusions: The P. tecunumanii transcriptome is the first gene catalogue for the species, representing an important resource for studying resistance to the pitch canker pathogen, F. circinatum. This study also constitutes, to our knowledge, the largest index of gymnosperm PR-genes to date.

AB  - Background: The annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus inhabits ephemeral ponds in northern Venezuela, South America, and is an emerging extremophile model for vertebrate diapause, stress tolerance, and evolution. Embryos of A. limnaeus regularly experience extended periods of desiccation and anoxia as a part of their natural history and have unique metabolic and developmental adaptations. Currently, there are limited genomic resources available for gene expression and evolutionary studies that can take advantage of A. limnaeus as a unique model system. Results: We describe the first draft genome sequence of A. limnaeus. The genome was assembled de novo using a merged assembly strategy and was annotated using the NCBI Eukaryotic Annotation Pipeline. We show that the assembled genome has a high degree of completeness in genic regions that is on par with several other teleost genomes. Using RNA-seq and phylogenetic-based approaches, we identify several candidate genes that may be important for embryonic stress tolerance and post-diapause development in A. limnaeus. Several of these genes include heat shock proteins that have unique expression patterns in A. limnaeus embryos and at least one of these may be under positive selection. Conclusion: The A. limnaeus genome is the first South American annual killifish genome made publicly available. This genome will be a valuable resource for comparative genomics to determine the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms that support the unique biology of annual killifishes. In a broader context, this genome will be a valuable tool for exploring genome-environment interactions and their impacts on vertebrate physiology and evolution.

AB  - RNA-Seq technology has been gradually becoming a routine approach for characterizing the properties of transcriptome in terms of organisms, cell types and conditions and consequently a big burden has been put on the facet of data analysis, which calls for an easy-to-learn workflow to cope with the increased demands from a large number of laboratories across the world. We report a one-in-all solution called hppRNA, composed of four scenarios such as pre-mapping, core-workflow, post-mapping and sequence variation detection, written by a series of individual Perl and R scripts, counting on well-established and preinstalled software, irrespective of single-end or paired-end, unstranded or stranded sequencing method. It features six independent core-workflows comprising the state-of-the-art technology with dozens of popular cutting-edge tools such as Tophat-Cufflink-Cuffdiff, SubreadfeatureCounts-DESeq2, STAR-RSEM-EBSeq, Bowtie-eXpress-edgeR, kallisto-sleuth, HISAT-StringTie-Ballgown, and embeds itself in Snakemake, which is a modern pipeline management system. The core function of this pipeline is turning the raw fastq files into gene/isoform expression matrix and differentially expressed genes or isoforms as well as the identification of fusion genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms, long noncoding RNAs and circular RNAs. Last but not least, this pipeline is specifically designed for performing the systematic analysis on a huge set of samples in one go, ideally for the researchers who intend to deploy the pipeline on their local servers. The scripts as well as the user manual are freely available at https://sourceforgenet/projects/hppma/

AB  - Background: Comprehensive understanding of intratumor heterogeneity requires identification of molecular markers, which are capable of differentiating different subpopulations and which also have clinical significance. One important tool that has been addressing this issue is single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNASeq) that allows the quantification of expression profiles of transcripts in individual cells in a population of cancer cells. Using the expression profiles from scRNASeq, current studies conduct analysis to group cells into different subpopulations using clustering algorithms. In this study, we explore scRNASeq cancer data from a different perspective. We focus on scRNASeq data originating from cancer cells pertaining to a particular cancer type, where the cell type or the subpopulation to which each cell belongs is known. We investigate if the "cell type" of a cancer cell can be predicted based on the expression profiles of a small set of transcripts. Results: We outline a predictive analytics pipeline to accurately predict 6 breast cancer cell types using single cell gene expression profiles. Instead of building predictive models using the complete human transcripts, the pipeline first eliminates predictors with low expression and low variance. A multinomial penalized logistic regression further reduces the size of the predictors to only 308, out of which 34 are long non-coding RNAs. Tuning of predictive models shows support vector machines and neural networks as the most accurate models achieving close to 98% prediction accuracies. We also find that mixture of protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs are better predictors compared to when the two sets of transcripts are treated separately. A signature risk score originating from 65 protein coding genes and 5 lncRNA predictors is associated with prognostic survival of TCGA breast cancer patients. This association was maintained when the risk scores were generated using 65 PCGs and 5 lncRNA separately. We further show that predictors restricted to a particular cell type serve as better prognostic markers for the respective patient subtype. Conclusion: Our results show that in general, the breast cancer cell type predictors are also associated with patient survivability and hence have clinical significance.

AB  - Motivation: RNA sequences of a gene can have single nucleotide variants (SNVs) due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genome, or RNA editing events within the RNA. By comparing RNA-seq data of a given cell type before and after a specific perturbation, we can detect and quantify SNVs in the RNA and discover SNVs with altered frequencies between distinct cellular states. Such differential variants in RNA (DVRs) may reflect allele-specific changes in gene expression or RNA processing, as well as changes in RNA editing in response to cellular perturbations or stimuli. Results: We have developed rMATS-DVR, a convenient and user-friendly software program to streamline the discovery of DVRs between two RNA-seq sample groups with replicates. rMATSDVR combines a stringent GATK-based pipeline for calling SNVs including SNPs and RNA editing events in RNA-seq reads, with our rigorous rMATS statistical model for identifying differential isoform ratios using RNA-seq sequence count data with replicates. We applied rMATS-DVR to RNAseq data of the human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 in response to shRNA knockdown of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1. rMATS-DVR discovered 1372 significant DVRs between knockdown and control. These DVRs encompassed known SNPs and RNA editing sites as well as novel SNVs, with the majority of DVRs corresponding to known RNA editing sites repressed after ADAR1 knockdown. Availability and Implementation: rMATS-DVR is at https://github. com/Xinglab/rMATS-DVR. Contact: yxing@ ucla. edu Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects half the US population over the age of 85 and is universally fatal following an average course of 10 years of progressive cognitive disability. Genetic and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified about 33 risk factor genes for common, late-onset AD (LOAD), but these risk loci fail to account for the majority of affected cases and can neither provide clinically meaningful prediction of development of AD nor offer actionable mechanisms. This cohort study generated large-scale matched multi-Omics data in AD and control brains for exploring novel molecular underpinnings of AD. Specifically, we generated whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing and proteome profiling data from multiple regions of 364 postmortem control, mild cognitive impaired (MCI) and AD brains with rich clinical and pathophysiological data. All the data went through rigorous quality control. Both the raw and processed data are publicly available through the Synapse software platform.

AB  - Driven by the recent advances of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and an urgent need to decode complex human diseases, a multitude of large-scale studies were conducted recently that have resulted in an unprecedented volume of whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data, such as the Genotype Tissue Expression project (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). While these data offer new opportunities to identify the mechanisms underlying disease, the comparison of data from different sources remains challenging, due to differences in sample and data processing. Here, we developed a pipeline that processes and unifies RNA-seq data from different studies, which includes uniform realignment, gene expression quantification, and batch effect removal. We find that uniform alignment and quantification is not sufficient when combining RNA-seq data from different sources and that the removal of other batch effects is essential to facilitate data comparison. We have processed data from GTEx and TCGA and successfully corrected for study-specific biases, enabling comparative analysis between TCGA and GTEx. The normalized datasets are available for download on figshare.

AB  - Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has been widely implemented in biological research and has made a profound impact on patient care. One of the essential NGS applications is to identify disease-causing sequence variants, where high coverage and accuracy are needed. Here, we reported a novel NGS pipeline, termed a Sequencing System of Digitalized Barcode Encrypted Single-stranded Library from Extremely Low (quality and quantity) DNA Input with Probe-based DNA Enrichment by RNA probes targeting DNA duplex (DEEPER-Seq). This method combines an ultra-sensitive single-stranded library construction with barcoding error correction, termed DEEPER-Library; and a DNA capture approach using RNA probes targeting both DNA strands, termed DEEPER-Capture. DEEPER-Seq can create NGS libraries from as little as 20 pg DNA with PCR error correcting capabilities, and capture target sequences at an average ratio of 29.2% by targeting both DNA strands simultaneously with an over 98.6% coverage. Our method tags and sequences each of the two strands of a DNA duplex independently and only scores mutations that are found at the same position in both strands, which allows us to identify mutations with allelic fractions down to 0.03% in a whole exome sequencing (WES) study with a background error rate of one artificial error per 4.8 x 10(9) nucleotides.

AB  - Heat stress (HS) causes detrimental effects on plant morphology, physiology, and biochemistry that lead to drastic reduction in plant biomass production and economic yield worldwide. To date, little is known about HS-responsive genes involved in thermotolerance mechanism in radish. In this study, a total of 6600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the control and Heat24 cDNA libraries of radish were isolated by high-throughput sequencing. With Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, some genes including MAPK, DREB, ERF, AP2, GST, Hsf, and Hsp were predominantly assigned in signal transductions, metabolic pathways, and biosynthesis and abiotic stress-responsive pathways. These pathways played significant roles in reducing stress-induced damages and enhancing heat tolerance in radish. Expression patterns of 24 candidate genes were validated by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Based mainly on the analysis of DEGs combining with the previous miRNAs analysis, the schematic model of HS-responsive regulatory network was proposed. To counter the effects of HS, a rapid response of the plasma membrane leads to the opening of specific calcium channels and cytoskeletal reorganization, after which HS-responsive genes are activated to repair damaged proteins and ultimately facilitate further enhancement of thermotolerance in radish. These results could provide fundamental insight into the regulatory network underlying heat tolerance in radish and facilitate further genetic manipulation of thermotolerance in root vegetable crops.

AB  - Numerous RNAs are enriched within cellular protrusions, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We had shown that the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) protein controls localization of some RNAs at protrusions. Here, using protrusion-isolation schemes and RNA-Seq, we find that RNAs localized in protrusions of migrating fibroblasts can be distinguished in two groups, which are differentially enriched in distinct types of protrusions, and are additionally differentially dependent on APC. APC-dependent RNAs become enriched in high-contractility protrusions and, accordingly, their localization is promoted by increasing stiffness of the extracellular matrix. Dissecting the underlying mechanism, we show that actomyosin contractility activates a RhoA-mDia1 signaling pathway that leads to formation of a detyrosinated-microtubule network, which in turn is required for localization of APC-dependent RNAs. Importantly, a competition-based approach to specifically mislocalize APC-dependent RNAs suggests that localization of the APC-dependent RNA subgroup is functionally important for cell migration.

AB  - Background: High-fidelity preservation strategies for primary tissues are in great demand in the single cell RNAseq community. A reliable method would greatly expand the scope of feasible multi-site collaborations and maximize the utilization of technical expertise. When choosing a method, standardizability and fidelity are important factors to consider due to the susceptibility of single-cell RNAseq analysis to technical noise. Existing approaches such as cryopreservation and chemical fixation are less than ideal for failing to satisfy either or both of these standards. Results: Here we propose a new strategy that leverages preservation schemes developed for organ transplantation. We evaluated the strategy by storing intact mouse kidneys in organ transplant preservative solution at hypothermic temperature for up to 4 days (6 h, 1, 2, 3, and 4 days), and comparing the quality of preserved and fresh samples using FACS and single cell RNAseq. We demonstrate that the strategy effectively maintained cell viability, transcriptome integrity, cell population heterogeneity, and transcriptome landscape stability for samples after up to 3 days of preservation. The strategy also facilitated the definition of the diverse spectrum of kidney resident immune cells, to our knowledge the first time at single cell resolution. Conclusions: Hypothermic storage of intact primary tissues in organ transplant preservative maintains the quality and stability of the transcriptome of cells for single cell RNAseq analysis. The strategy is readily generalizable to primary specimens from other tissue types for single cell RNAseq analysis.

AB  - Alternative splicing dramatically increases transcriptome complexity but its contribution to proteome diversity remains controversial. Exon-exon junction spanning peptides provide direct evidence for the translation of specific splice isoforms and are critical for delineating protein isoform complexity. Here we found that junction-spanning peptides are underrepresented in publicly available mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics data sets. Further analysis showed that evolutionarily conserved preferential nucleotide usage at exon boundaries increases the occurrence of lysine-and arginine-coding triplets at the end of exons. Because both lysine and arginine residues are cleavage sites of trypsin, the nearly exclusive use of trypsin as the protein digestion enzyme in shotgun proteomic analyses hinders the detection of junction-spanning peptides. To study the impact of enzyme selection on splice junction detectability, we performed in-silico digestion of the human proteome using six proteases. The six enzymes created a total of 161,125 detectable junctions, and only 1,029 were common across all enzyme digestions. Chymotrypsin digestion provided the largest number of detectable junctions. Our experimental results further showed that combination of a chymotrypsin-based human proteome analysis with a trypsin-based analysis increased detection of junctionspanning peptides by 37% over the trypsin-only analysis and identified over a thousand junctions that were undetectable in fully tryptic digests. Our study demonstrates that detection of proteome diversity resulted from alternative splicing is limited by trypsin cleavage specificity, and that complementary digestion schemes will be essential to comprehensively analyze the translation of alternative splicing isoforms.

AB  - The objective of this article is to introduce valid and robust methods for the analysis of rare variants for family-based exome chips, whole-exome sequencing or whole-genome sequencing data. Family-based designs provide unique opportunities to detect genetic variants that complement studies of unrelated individuals. Currently, limited methods and software tools have been developed to assist family-based association studies with rare variants, especially for analyzing binary traits. In this article, we address this gap by extending existing burden and kernel-based gene set association tests for population data to related samples, with a particular emphasis on binary phenotypes. The proposed approach blends the strengths of kernel machine methods and generalized estimating equations. Importantly, the efficient generalized kernel score test can be applied as a mega-analysis framework to combine studies with different designs. We illustrate the application of the proposed method using data from an exome sequencing study of autism. Methods discussed in this article are implemented in an R package 'gskat', which is available on CRAN and GitHub.

AB  - Numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) identified and characterized in mammals, plants and fungi have been found to play critical regulatory roles in biological processes. However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in oomycete plant pathogens, which cause devastating damage to the economy and ecosystems. We used strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to generate a computational pipeline to identify lncRNAs in Phytophthora sojae, a model oomycete plant pathogen. In total, 940 lncRNAs with 1010 isoforms were identified from RNA-seq data obtained from four representative stages of P.sojae. The lncRNAs had shorter transcript lengths, longer exon lengths, fewer numbers of exons, lower GC content and higher minimum free energy values compared with protein-coding genes. lncRNAs in P.sojae exhibited low sequence conservation amongst oomycetes and P.sojae isolates. Transcriptional data indicated that P.sojae lncRNAs tended to be transcribed in a stage-specific manner; representative lncRNAs were validated by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Phytophthora sojae lncRNAs were concentrated in gene-sparse regions, and lncRNAs were associated with secreted protein and effector coding genes. The neighbouring genes of lncRNAs encoded various effector family members, and RNA-seq data revealed a correlation between the transcription level of lncRNAs and their neighbouring genes. Our results provide the first comprehensive identification of lncRNAs in oomycetes and suggest a potential association between lncRNAs and effector genes.

AB  - Testing dependence/correlation of two variables is one of the fundamental tasks in statistics. In this work, we proposed an efficient method for nonlinear dependence of two continuous variables (X and Y). We addressed this research question by using BNNPT (Bagging Nearest-Neighbor Prediction independence Test, software available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/bnnpt/). In the BNNPT framework, we first used the value of X to construct a bagging neighborhood structure. We then obtained the out of bag estimator of Y based on the bagging neighborhood structure. The square error was calculated to measure how well Y is predicted by X. Finally, a permutation test was applied to determine the significance of the observed square error. To evaluate the strength of BNNPT compared to seven other methods, we performed extensive simulations to explore the relationship between various methods and compared the false positive rates and statistical power using both simulated and real datasets (Rugao longevity cohort mitochondrial DNA haplogroups and kidney cancer RNA-seq datasets). We concluded that BNNPT is an efficient computational approach to test nonlinear correlation in real world applications.

AB  - Motivation: Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have risen to prominence in cancer biology as new biomarkers of disease. Those lincRNAs transcribed from active cis-regulatory elements (enhancers) have provided mechanistic insight into cis-acting regulation; however, in the absence of an enhancer hallmark, computational prediction of cis-acting transcription of lincRNAs remains challenging. Here, we introduce a novel transcriptomic method: a cis-regulatory lincRNA-gene associating metric, termed 'CisPi'. CisPi quantifies the mutual information between lincRNAs and local gene expression regarding their response to perturbation, such as disease risk-dependence. To predict risk-dependent lincRNAs in neuroblastoma, an aggressive pediatric cancer, we advance this scoring scheme to measure lincRNAs that represent the minority of reads in RNA-Seq libraries by a novel side-by-side analytical pipeline. Results: Altered expression of lincRNAs that stratifies tumor risk is an informative readout of oncogenic enhancer activity. Our CisPi metric therefore provides a powerful computational model to identify enhancer-templated RNAs (eRNAs), eRNA-like lincRNAs, or active enhancers that regulate the expression of local genes. First, risk-dependent lincRNAs revealed active enhancers, over-represented neuroblastoma susceptibility loci, and uncovered novel clinical biomarkers. Second, the prioritized lincRNAs were significantly prognostic. Third, the predicted target genes further inherited the prognostic significance of these lincRNAs. In sum, RNA-Seq alone is sufficient to identify disease-associated lincRNAs using our methodologies, allowing broader applications to contexts in which enhancer hallmarks are not available or show limited sensitivity.

AB  - Biology research has entered into the big data era. Systems biology approaches, therefore, have become essential tools to elucidate the whole landscape of how cells separate, grow, and resist different stresses. In 2009, a novel RNA technology, termed ribosome profiling, was invented by Dr. JonathanWeissman Lab from UCSF. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) is a powerful tool which can provide the most direct readout of the intracellular translation state of a protein including information on the location of translation start/stop sites, ribosome distribution pattern, and even the moving rate of the translating ribosome, at the whole-genome scale and single-nucleotide resolution. To date, many researchers including our lab have successfully applied ribosome profiling method for diverse purposes. We thus review in this chapter the underlying mechanism and recent advances as regards this fantastic tool. Firstly, we introduce the working mechanism, advantages, and study history of ribosome profiling. Secondly, we discuss the data analysis pipeline, also compare different statistical algorithms and data visualization software. Finally, we review the extensive applications of Ribo-seq, for example, identification of uORF, computation of global translation efficiency (TE), the study of the posttranscriptional regulatory role of RNA binding protein and others. We hope this chapter would be useful for interested systems biology researchers as well as RNA biologists.

AB  - Paulownia witches' broom (PaWB) disease caused by phytoplasmas is a fatal disease that leads to considerable economic losses. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to play critical regulatory roles in posttranscriptional and transcriptional regulation. However, lncRNAs and their functional roles remain poorly characterized in Paulownia. To identify lncRNAs and investigate their roles in the response to PaWB phytoplasmas, RNA sequencing was performed for healthy Paulownia tomentosa, PaWB-infected P. tomentosa, and for healthy and PaWB-infected P. tomentosa treated with 100 mg L-1 rifampicin. A total of 28,614 unique mRNAs and 3693 potential lncRNAs were identified. Comparisons between lncRNAs and coding genes indicated that lncRNAs tended to have shorter transcripts and fewer exon numbers, and displayed significant expression specificity. Based on our comparison scheme, 1063 PaWB-related mRNAs and 110 PaWB-related lncRNAs were identified; among them, 12 PaWB-related candidate target genes that were regulated by nine PaWB-related lncRNAs were characterized. This study provides the first catalog of lncRNAs expressed in Paulownia and gives a revealing insight into the molecular mechanism responsible for PaWB.

AB  - Background: The development of single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled profound discoveries in biology, ranging from the dissection of the composition of complex tissues to the identification of novel cell types and dynamics in some specialized cellular environments. However, the large-scale generation of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data collected at multiple time points remains a challenge to effective measurement gene expression patterns in transcriptome analysis. Results: We present an algorithm based on the Dynamic Time Warping score (DTWscore) combined with time-series data, that enables the detection of gene expression changes across scRNA-seq samples and recovery of potential cell types from complex mixtures of multiple cell types. Conclusions: The DTWscore successfully classify cells of different types with the most highly variable genes from time-series scRNA-seq data. The study was confined to methods that are implemented and available within the R framework. Sample datasets and R packages are available at https://github.com/xiaoxiaoxier/DTWscore.

AB  - Whole transcriptome studies typically yield large amounts of data, with expression values for all genes or transcripts of the genome. The search for genes of interest in a particular study setting can thus be a daunting task, usually relying on automated computational methods Moreover, most biological questions imply that such a search should be performed in a multivariate setting, to take into account the inter-genes relationships. Differential expression analysis commonly yields large lists of genes deemed significant, even after adjustment for multiple testing, making the subsequent study possibilities extensive. Here, we explore the use of supervised learning methods to rank large ensembles of genes defined by their expression values measured with RNA-Seq in a typical 2 classes sample set. First, we use one of the variable importance measures generated by the random forests classification algorithm as a metric to rank genes Second, we define the EPS (extreme pseudo-samples) pipeline, making use of VAEs (Variational Autoencoders) and regressors to extract a ranking of genes while leveraging the feature space of both virtual and comparable samples We show that, on 12 cancer RNA-Seq data sets ranging from 323 to 1,210 samples, using either a random forests-based gene selection method or the EPS pipeline outperforms differential expression analysis for 9 and 8 out of the 12 datasets respectively, in terms of identifying subsets of genes associated with survival These results demonstrate the potential of supervised learning-based gene selection methods in RNA-Seq studies and highlight the need to use such multivariate gene selection methods alongside the widely used differential expression analysis.

AB  - Motivation: Sequencing-based methods to examine fundamental features of the genome, such as gene expression and chromatin structure, rely on inferences from the abundance and distribution of reads derived from Illumina sequencing. Drawing sound inferences from such experiments relies on appropriate mathematical methods to model the distribution of reads along the genome, which has been challenging due to the scale and nature of these data. Results: We propose a new framework (SRSFseq) based on square root slope functions shape analysis to analyse Illumina sequencing data. In the new approach the basic unit of information is the density of mapped reads over region of interest located on the known reference genome. The densities are interpreted as shapes and a new shape analysis model is proposed. An equivalent of a Fisher test is used to quantify the significance of shape differences in read distributibn patterns between groups of density functions in different experimental conditions. We evaluated the performance of this new framework to analyze RNA-seq data at the exon level, which enabled the detection of variation in read distributions and abundances between experimental conditions not detected by other methods. Thus, the method is a suitable supplement to the state-of-the-art count based techniques. The variety of density representations and flexibility of mathematical design allow the model to be easily adapted to other data types or problems in which the distribution of reads is to be tested. The functional interpretation and SRSF phase-amplitude separation technique give an efficient noise reduction procedure improving the sensitivity and specificity of the method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Complex microbial communities are an area of growing interest in biology. Metatranscriptomics allows researchers to quantify microbial gene expression in an environmental sample via high-throughput sequencing. Metatranscriptomic experiments are computationally intensive because the experiments generate a large volume of sequence data and each sequence must be compared with reference sequences from thousands of organisms. Results: SAMSA2 is an upgrade to the original Simple Annotation of Metatranscriptomes by Sequence Analysis (SAMSA) pipeline that has been redesigned for standalone use on a supercomputing cluster. SAMSA2 is faster due to the use of the DIAMOND aligner, and more flexible and reproducible because it uses local databases. SAMSA2 is available with detailed documentation, and example input and output files along with examples of master scripts for full pipeline execution. Conclusions: SAMSA2 is a rapid and efficient metatranscriptome pipeline for analyzing large RNA-seq datasets in a supercomputing cluster environment. SAMSA2 provides simplified output that can be examined directly or used for further analyses, and its reference databases may be upgraded, altered or customized to fit the needs of any experiment.

AB  - Complex changes in gene expression typically mediate a large portion of a cellular response. Each gene may change expression with unique kinetics as the gene is regulated by the particular timing of one of many stimuli, signaling pathways or secondary effects. In order to capture the entire gene expression response to hypoxia in the yeast S. cerevisiae, RNA-seq analysis was used to monitor the mRNA levels of all genes at specific times after exposure to hypoxia. Hypoxia was established by growing cells in similar to 100% N-2 gas. Importantly, unlike other hypoxic studies, ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids were not added to the media because these metabolites affect gene expression. Time points were chosen in the range of 0-4 h after hypoxia because that period captures the major changes in gene expression. At each time point, mid-log hypoxic cells were quickly filtered and frozen, limiting exposure to O-2 and concomitant changes in gene expression. Total RNA was extracted from cells and used to enrich for mRNA, which was then converted to cDNA. From this cDNA, multiplex libraries were created and eight or more samples were sequenced in one lane of a next-generation sequencer. A post-sequencing pipeline is described, which includes quality base trimming, read mapping and determining the number of reads per gene. DESeq2 within the R statistical environment was used to identify genes that change significantly at any one of the hypoxic time points. Analysis of three biological replicates revealed high reproducibility, genes of differing kinetics and a large number of expected O-2-regulated genes. These methods can be used to study how the cells of various organisms respond to hypoxia over time and adapted to study gene expression during other cellular responses.

AB  - We assessed the performance characteristics of an RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) assay designed to detect gene fusions in 571 genes to help manage patients with cancer. Polyadenylated RNA was converted to cDNA, which was then used to prepare next-generation sequencing libraries that were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument and analyzed with an in-house developed bioinformatic pipeline. The assay identified 38 of 41 gene fusions detected by another method, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization or RT-PCR, for a sensitivity of 93%. No false-positive gene fusions were identified in 15 normal tissue specimens and 10 tumor specimens that were negative for fusions by RNA sequencing or Mate Pair NGS (100% specificity). The assay also identified 22 fusions in 17 tumor specimens that had not been detected by other methods. Eighteen of the 22 fusions had not previously been described. Good intra-assay and interassay reproducibility was observed with complete concordance for the presence or absence of gene fusions in replicates. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was tested by diluting RNA isolated from gene fusion-positive cases with fusion-negative RNA. Gene fusions were generally detectable down to 12.5% dilutions for most fusions and as little as 3% for some fusions. This assay can help identify fusions in patients with cancer; these patients may in turn benefit from both US Food and Drug Administration-approved and investigational targeted therapies.

AB  - Background Pipeline comparisons for gene expression data are highly valuable for applied real data analyses, as they enable the selection of suitable analysis strategies for the dataset at hand. Such pipelines for RNA-Seq data should include mapping of reads, counting and differential gene expression analysis or preprocessing, normalization and differential gene expression in case of microarray analysis, in order to give a global insight into pipeline performances. Methods Four commonly used RNA-Seq pipelines (STAR/HTSeq-Count/edgeR, STAR/RSEM/ edgeR, Sailfish/edgeR, TopHat2/Cufflinks/CuffDiff)) were investigated on multiple levels (alignment and counting) and cross-compared with the microarray counterpart on the level of gene expression and gene ontology enrichment. For these comparisons we generated two matched microarray and RNA-Seq datasets: Burkitt Lymphoma cell line data and rectal cancer patient data. Results The overall mapping rate of STAR was 98.98% for the cell line dataset and 98.49% for the patient dataset. Tophat's overall mapping rate was 97.02% and 96.73%, respectively, while Sailfish had only an overall mapping rate of 84.81% and 54.44%. The correlation of gene expression in microarray and RNA-Seq data was moderately worse for the patient dataset (rho = 0.67-0.69) than for the cell line dataset (rho = 0.87-0.88). An exception were the correlation results of Cufflinks, which were substantially lower (rho = 0.21-0.29 and 0.34-0.53). For both datasets we identified very low numbers of differentially expressed genes using the microarray platform. For RNA-Seq we checked the agreement of differentially expressed genes identified in the different pipelines and of GO-term enrichment results. Conclusion In conclusion the combination of STAR aligner with HTSeq-Count followed by STAR aligner with RSEM and Sailfish generated differentially expressed genes best suited for the dataset at hand and in agreement with most of the other transcriptomics pipelines.

AB  - Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is extensively associated with cancer development and progression. miRNAs have been shown to be biomarkers for predicting tumor formation and outcome. However, identification of the relationships between miRNA expression and tumor characteristics can be difficult and time-consuming without appropriate bioinformatics expertise. To address this issue, we present OncomiR, an online resource for exploring miRNA dysregulation in cancer. Using combined miRNA-seq, RNA-seq and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we systematically performed statistical analyses to identify dysregulated miRNAs that are associated with tumor development and progression in most major cancer types. Additional analyses further identified potential miRNA-gene target interactions in tumors. These results are stored in a backend database and presented through a web server interface. Moreover, through a backend bioinformatics pipeline, OncomiR can also perform dynamic analysis with custom miRNA selections for in-depth characterization of miRNAs in cancer.

AB  - Salvia miltiorrhiza is one of the most widely-used medicinal plants. Here, we systematically analyzed the RNA editing events in its mitochondria. We developed a pipeline using REDItools to predict RNA editing events from stand-specific RNA-Seq data. The predictions were validated using reverse transcription, RT-PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing experiments. Putative sequences motifs were characterized. Comparative analyses were carried out between S. miltiorrhiza, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. We discovered 1123 editing sites, including 225 "C to U" sites in the protein-coding regions. Fourteen of sixteen (87.5%) sites were validated. Three putative DNA motifs were identified around the predicted sites. The nucleotides on both strands at 115 of the 225 sites had undergone RNA editing, which we called symmetrical RNA editing (SRE). Four of six these SRE sites (66.7%) were experimentally confirmed. Re-examination of strand-specific RNA-Seq data from A. thaliana and O. sativa identified 327 and 369 SRE sites respectively. 78, 20 and 13 SRE sites were found to be conserved among A. thaliana, O. sativa and S. miltiorrhiza respectively. This study provides a comprehensive picture of RNA editing events in the mitochondrial genome of S. miltiorrhiza. We identified SREs for the first time, which may represent a universal phenomenon.

AB  - Chicken is widely favored by consumers because of some unique features. The leg muscles occupy an important position in the market. However, the specific mechanism for regulating muscle growth speed is not clear. In this experiment, we used Jinghai yellow chickens with different body weights at 300 days as research subjects. The chickens were divided into fast- and slow-growing groups, and we collected leg muscles after slaughtering for use in RNA-seq. After comparing the two groups, 87 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (fold change >= 2 and FDR < 0.05). The fast-growing group had 42 up-regulated genes and 45 down-regulated genes among these DEGs compared to the slow-growing group. Six items were significantly enriched in the biological process: embryo development ending in birth or egg hatching, chordate embryonic development, embryonic skeletal system development, and embryo development as well as responses to ketones and the sulfur compound biosynthetic process. Two significantly enriched pathways were found in the KEGG pathway analysis (P-value < 0.05): the insulin signaling pathway and the adipocytokine signaling pathway. This study provides a theoretical basis for the molecular mechanism of chicken growth and for improving the production of Jinghai yellow chicken.

AB  - RNA editing is a post-transcriptional or cotranscriptional process that changes the sequence of the precursor transcript by substitutions, insertions, or deletions. Almost all of the land plants undergo RNA editing in organelles (plastids and mitochondria). Although several software tools have been developed to identify RNA editing events, there has been a great challenge to distinguish true RNA editing events from genome variation, sequencing errors, and other factors. Here we introduce REDO, a comprehensive application tool for identifying RNA editing events in plant organelles based on variant call format files from RNA-sequencing data. REDO is a suite of Perl scripts that illustrate a bunch of attributes of RNA editing events in figures and tables. REDO can also detect RNA editing events in multiple samples simultaneously and identify the significant differential proportion of RNA editing loci. Comparing with similar tools, such as REDItools, REDO runs faster with higher accuracy, and more specificity at the cost of slightly lower sensitivity. Moreover, REDO annotates each RNA editing site in RNAs, whereas REDItools reports only possible RNA editing sites in genome, which need additional steps to obtain RNA editing profiles for RNAs. Overall, REDO can identify potential RNA editing sites easily and provide several functions such as detailed annotations, statistics, figures, and significantly differential proportion of RNA editing sites among different samples.

AB  - Although many tools have been developed to analyze small RNA sequencing (sRNA-Seq) data, it remains challenging to accurately analyze the small RNA population, mainly due to multiple sequence ID assignment caused by short read length. Additional issues in small RNA analysis include low consistency of microRNA (miRNA) measurement results across different platforms, miRNA mapping associated with miRNA sequence variation (isomiR) and RNA editing, and the origin of those unmapped reads after screening against all endogenous reference sequence databases. To address these issues, we built a comprehensive and customizable sRNA-Seq data analysis pipeline--sRNAnalyzer, which enables: (i) comprehensive miRNA profiling strategies to better handle isomiRs and summarization based on each nucleotide position to detect potential SNPs in miRNAs, (ii) different sequence mapping result assignment approaches to simulate results from microarray/qRT-PCR platforms and a local probabilistic model to assign mapping results to the mostlikely IDs, (iii) comprehensive ribosomal RNA filtering for accurate mapping of exogenous RNAs and summarization based on taxonomy annotation. We evaluated our pipeline on both artificial samples (including synthetic miRNA and Escherichia coli cultures) and biological samples (human tissue and plasma). sRNAnalyzer is implemented in Perl and available at: http://srnanalyzer. systemsbiology. net/.

AB  - In bioinformatics, as well as other computationally intensive research fields, there is a need for workflows that can reliably produce consistent output, from known sources, independent of the software environment or configuration settings of the machine on which they are executed. Indeed, this is essential for controlled comparison between different observations and for the wider dissemination of workflows. However, providing this type of reproducibility and traceability is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which generally comes in various versions. Moreover, in many fields (bioinformatics being a prime example), these versions are subject to continual change due to rapidly evolving technologies, further complicating problems related to reproducibility. Here, we propose a principled approach for building analysis pipelines and managing their dependencies with GNU Guix. As a case study to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present a set of highly reproducible pipelines called PiGx for the analysis of RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, bisulfite-treated DNA sequencing, and single-cell resolution RNA sequencing. All pipelines process raw experimental data and generate reports containing publication-ready plots and figures, with interactive report elements and standard observables. Users may install these highly reproducible packages and apply them to their own datasets without any special computational expertise beyond the use of the command line. We hope such a toolkit will provide immediate benefit to laboratory workers wishing to process their own datasets or bioinformaticians seeking to automate all, or parts of, their analyses. In the long term, we hope our approach to reproducibility will serve as a blueprint for reproducible workflows in other areas. Our pipelines, along with their corresponding documentation and sample reports, are available at http://bioinformatics.mdc-berlin.de/pigx

AB  - Genomic imprinting leads to different expression levels of maternally and paternally derived alleles. Over the last years, major progress has been made in identifying novel imprinted candidate genes in plants, owing to affordable next-generation sequencing technologies. However, reports on sequencing the transcriptome of hybrid F1 seed tissues strongly disagree about how many and which genes are imprinted. This raises questions about the relative impact of biological, environmental, technical, and analytic differences or biases. Here, we adopt a statistical approach, frequently used in RNA-seq data analysis, which properly models count overdispersion and considers replicate information of reciprocal crosses. We show that our statistical pipeline outperforms other methods in identifying imprinted genes in simulated and real data. Accordingly, reanalysis of genome-wide imprinting studies in Arabidopsis and maize shows that, at least for Arabidopsis, an increased agreement across datasets could be observed. For maize, however, consistent reanalysis did not yield a larger overlap between the datasets. This suggests that the discrepancy across publications might be partially due to different analysis pipelines but that technical, biological, and environmental factors underlie much of the discrepancy between datasets. Finally, we show that the set of genes that can be characterized regarding allelic bias by all studies with minimal confidence is small (similar to 8,000/27,416 genes for Arabidopsis and similar to 12,000/39,469 for maize). In conclusion, we propose to use biologically replicated reciprocal crosses, high sequence coverage, and a generalized linear model approach to identify differentially expressed alleles in developing seeds.

AB  - Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are biologically significant in variable ways. They modulate gene expression at the levels of transcription and post-transcription. MiRNAs and lncRNAs are two major classes of non-coding RNAs and have been extensively characterized. They are implicated in various biological processes and diseases. Thus, identification of miRNAs and lncRNAs are fundamental to further understand their roles and dissect their mechanisms. Here, we overviewed pipelines of identifying miRNAs and lncRNAs based on next-generation sequencing technologies. We applied the pipelines to identify miRNAs in multiple cell lines and perform expression quantification of mature, precursor and primary miRNAs. In addition, we provided an alternative way to re-annotate lncRNAs from microarray data. We summarized multiple resources and databases for lncRNA annotation and compared their annotation processes and specific parameters. Finally, we utilized RNA-seq and miRNA-seq data to construct a comprehensive transcriptome containing miRNAs, lncRNAs and protein-coding genes in heart failure.

AB  - Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of cellular functions and physiology. Yet functional lincRNAs often have low, context-specific and tissue-specific expression. We hypothesized that many human monocyte and adipose lincRNAs would be absent in current public annotations due to lincRNA tissue specificity, modest sequencing depth in public data, limitations of transcriptome assembly algorithms, and lack of dynamic physiological contexts. Deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed in peripheral blood CD14(+) monocytes (monocytes; average similar to 247 million reads per sample) and adipose tissue (average similar to 378 million reads per sample) collected before and after human experimental endotoxemia, an in vivo inflammatory stress, to identify tissue-specific and clinically relevant lincRNAs. Using a stringent filtering pipeline, we identified 109 unannotated lincRNAs in monocytes and 270 unannotated lincRNAs in adipose. Most unannotated lincRNAs are not conserved in rodents and are tissue specific, while many have features of regulated expression and are enriched in transposable elements. Specific subsets have enhancer RNA characteristics or are expressed only during inflammatory stress. A subset of unannotated lincRNAs was validated and replicated for their presence and inflammatory induction in independent human samples and for their monocyte and adipocyte origins. Through interrogation of public genome-wide association data, we also found evidence of specific disease association for selective unannotated lincRNAs. Our findings highlight the critical need to perform deep RNA-Seq in a cell-, tissue-, and context-specific manner to annotate the full repertoire of human lincRNAs for a complete understanding of lincRNA roles in dynamic cell functions and in human disease.

AB  - Background: Alternative polyadenylation (APA) results in messenger RNA molecules with different 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), affecting the molecules' stability, localization, and translation. APA is pervasive and implicated in cancer. Earlier reports on APA focused on 3' UTR length modifications and commonly characterized APA events as 3' UTR shortening or lengthening. However, such characterization oversimplifies the processing of 3' ends of transcripts and fails to adequately describe the various scenarios we observe. Results: We built a cloud-based targeted de novo transcript assembly and analysis pipeline that incorporates our previously developed cleavage site prediction tool, KLEAT. We applied this pipeline to elucidate the APA profiles of 114 genes in 9939 tumor and 729 tissue normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The full set of 10,668 RNA-Seq samples from 33 cancer types has not been utilized by previous APA studies. By comparing the frequencies of predicted cleavage sites between normal and tumor sample groups, we identified 77 events (i.e. gene-cancer type pairs) of tumor-specific APA regulation in 13 cancer types; for 15 genes, such regulation is recurrent across multiple cancers. Our results also support a previous report showing the 3' UTR shortening of FGF2 in multiple cancers. However, over half of the events we identified display complex changes to 3' UTR length that resist simple classification like shortening or lengthening. Conclusions: Recurrent tumor-specific regulation of APA is widespread in cancer. However, the regulation pattern that we observed in TCGA RNA-seq data cannot be described as straightforward 3' UTR shortening or lengthening. Continued investigation into this complex, nuanced regulatory landscape will provide further insight into its role in tumor formation and development.

AB  - Background: The spliceosomal transfer of a short spliced leader (SL) RNA to an independent pre-mRNA molecule is called SL trans-splicing and is widespread in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. While RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data contain information on such events, properly documented methods to extract them are lacking. Findings: To address this, we developed SL-quant, a fast and flexible pipeline that adapts to paired-end and single-end RNA-seq data and accurately quantifies SL trans-splicing events. It is designed to work downstream of read mapping and uses the reads left unmapped as primary input. Briefly, the SL sequences are identified with high specificity and are trimmed from the input reads, which are then remapped on the reference genome and quantified at the nucleotide position level (SL trans-splice sites) or at the gene level. Conclusions: SL-quant completes within 10 minutes on a basic desktop computer for typical C. elegans RNA-seq datasets and can be applied to other species as well. Validating the method, the SL trans-splice sites identified display the expected consensus sequence, and the results of the gene-level quantification are predictive of the gene position within operons. We also compared SL-quant to a recently published SL-containing read identification strategy that was found to be more sensitive but less specific than SL-quant. Both methods are implemented as a bash script available under the MIT license [1]. Full instructions for its installation, usage, and adaptation to other organisms are provided.

AB  - Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used in a range of biomedical studies. Nonetheless, current RNA-seq analysis tools are not specifically designed to efficiently process scRNA-seq data due to their limited scalability. Here we introduce Falco, a cloud-based framework to enable paralellization of existing RNA-seq processing pipelines using big data technologies of Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark for performing massively parallel analysis of large scale transcriptomic data. Using two public scRNA-seq datasets and two popular RNA-seq alignment/feature quantification pipelines, we show that the same processing pipeline runs 2.6-145.4 times faster using Falco than running on a highly optimized standalone computer. Falco also allows users to utilize low-cost spot instances of Amazon Web Services, providing a similar to 65% reduction in cost of analysis. Availability and Implementation: Falco is available via a GNU General Public License at https:// github. com/VCCRI/Falco/ Contact: j.ho@victorchang.edu.au Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - Late blight caused by the oomycete fungus Phytophthora infestans (Pi) is the most serious obstacle to potato (Solanum tuberosum) production in the world. A super race isolate, CN152, which was identified from Sichuan Province, China, could overcome nearly all known late blight resistance genes and caused serious damage in China. The potato genotype SD20 was verified to be highly resistant to CN152; however, the molecular regulation network underlying late blight resistance pathway remains unclear in SD20. Here, we performed a time-course experiment to systematically profile the late blight resistance response genes using RNA-sequencing in SD20. We identified 3354 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which mainly encoded transcription factors and protein kinases, and also included four NBS-LRR genes. The late blight responsive genes showed time-point-specific induction/repression. Multi-signaling pathways of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene signaling pathways involved in resistance and defense against Pi in SD20. Gene Ontology and KEGG analyses indicated that the DEGs were significantly enriched in metabolic process, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Forty-three DEGs were involved in immune response, of which 19 were enriched in hypersensitive response reaction, which could play an important role in broad-spectrum resistance to Pi infection. Experimental verification confirmed the induced expression of the responsive genes in the late blight resistance signaling pathway, such as WRKY, ERF, MAPK, and NBS-LRR family genes. Our results provided valuable information for understanding late blight resistance mechanism of potato.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding RNAs that are involved in a variety of biological processes. The pig is an important farm animal and an ideal biomedical model. In this study, we performed a genome-wide scan for lncRNAs in multiple tissue types from pigs. A total of 118 million paired-end 90 nt clean reads were obtained via strand-specific RNA sequencing, 80.4% of which were aligned to the pig reference genome. We developed a stringent bioinformatics pipeline to identify 2,139 high-quality multiexonic lncRNAs. The characteristic analysis revealed that the novel lncRNAs showed relatively shorter transcript length, fewer exons, and lower expression levels in comparison with protein-coding genes (PCGs). The guanine-cytosine (GC) content of the protein-coding exons and introns was significantly higher than that of the lncRNAs. Moreover, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density of lncRNAs was significantly higher than that of PCGs. Conservation analysis revealed that most lncRNAs were evolutionarily conserved among pigs, humans, and mice, such as CUFF.253988.1, which shares homology with human long noncoding RNA MALAT1. The findings of our study significantly increase the number of known lncRNAs in pigs.

AB  - A complete understanding of human cancer variants requires new methods to systematically and efficiently assess the functional effects of genomic mutations at a large scale. Here, we describe a set of tools to rapidly clone and stratify thousands of cancer mutations at base resolution. This protocol provides a massively parallel pipeline to achieve high stringency and throughput. The approach includes high-throughput generation of mutant clones by Gateway, confirmation of variant identity by barcoding and next-generation sequencing, and stratification of cancer variants by multiplexed interaction profiling. Compared with alternative site-directed mutagenesis methods, our protocol requires less sequencing effort and enables robust statistical calling of allelespecific effects. To ensure the precision of variant interaction profiling, we further describe two complementary methods-a highthroughput enhanced yeast two-hybrid (HT-eY2H) assay and a mammalian-cell-based Gaussia princeps luciferase protein-fragment complementation assay (GPCAPCAPCA). These independent assays with standard controls validate mutational interaction profiles with high quality. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for classifying candidate cancer alleles emerging from wholegenome or whole-exome sequencing projects as 'drivers' or 'passengers'. For similar to 100 genomic mutations, the protocol-including target primer design, variant library construction, and sequence verification-can be completed within as little as 2-3 weeks, and cancer variant stratification can be completed within 2 weeks.

AB  - Beneficial plant-associated bacteria play an important role in promoting growth and preventing disease in plants. The application of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) as biofertilizers or biocontrol agents has become an effective alternative to the use of conventional fertilizers and can increase crop productivity at low cost. Plant-microbe interactions depend upon host plant-secreted signals and a reaction hereon by their associated bacteria. However, the molecular mechanisms of how beneficial bacteria respond to their associated plant-derived signals are not fully understood. Assessing the transcriptomic response of bacteria to root exudates is a powerful approach to determine the bacterial gene expression and regulation under rhizospheric conditions. Such knowledge is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in plant-microbe interactions. This paper describes a detailed protocol to study the transcriptomic response of B. mycoides EC18, a strain isolated from the potato endosphere, to potato root exudates. With the help of recent high-throughput sequencing technology, this protocol can be performed in several weeks and produce massive datasets. First, we collect the root exudates under sterile conditions, after which they are added to B. mycoides cultures. The RNA from these cultures is isolated using a phenol/chloroform method combined with a commercial kit and subjected to quality control by an automated electrophoresis instrument. After sequencing, data analysis is performed with the web-based T-REx pipeline and a group of differentially expressed genes is identified. This method is a useful tool to facilitate new discoveries on the bacterial genes involved in plant-microbe interactions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can occur in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). However, brain AVM without HHT has also been reported. Using whole exome sequencing, the authors performed comprehensive genomic characterization of a 6-person Turkish family with 3 cases of brain AVM without HHT. METHODS Three siblings with brain AVM, one of whom also had spinal AVM, were evaluated. The parents and the fourth sibling had no AVM on cranial MRI. The authors performed a whole exome capture and Illumina sequencing on blood samples from 2 siblings with AVM. RESULTS An ACVRL1 heterozygous mutation (plys332Glu) was identified in 2 patients via whole exome sequencing. Variant segregation was confirmed using direct Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSIONS Study results suggested that whole exome sequencing analysis is particularly useful in cases of locus heterogeneity and uncertain diagnostic classification schemes in patients with hereditary brain AVM.

AB  - Boron (B), a trace element found in the human body, plays an important role for health of bone by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. Our research group previously fabricated B-mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) scaffolds, which successfully promoted osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts when compared to pure MBG scaffolds without boron. However, the mechanisms of the positive effect of B-MBG scaffolds on osteogenesis remain unknown. Therefore, we performed in-vivo experiments in OVX rat models with pure MBG scaffolds and compared them to B-MBG scaffold. As a result, we found that B-MBG scaffold induced more new bone regeneration compared to pure MBG scaffold and examined genes related to bone regeneration induced by B-MBG scaffold through RNA-seq to obtain target genes and epigenetic mechanisms. The results demonstrated an increased expression and affiliation of Setd7 in the B-MBG group when compared to the MBG group. Immunofluorescent staining from our in vivo samples further demonstrated a higher localization of Setd7 and H3K4me3 in Runx2-positive cells in defects treated with B-MBG scaffolds. KEGG results suggested that specifically Wnt/I3-catenin signaling pathway was highly activated in new bone area associated with B-MBG scaffolds. Thereafter, in vitro studies with human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) stimulated by extracted liquid of B-MBG scaffolds was associated with significantly elevated levels of Setd7, as well as H3K4me3 when compared to MBG scaffolds alone. To verify the role of Setd7 in new bone formation in the presence of Boron, Setd7 was knocked down in hBMSCs with stimulation of the extracted liquids of B-MBG or MBG scaffolds. The result showed that osteoblast differentiation of hBMSCs was inhibited when Setd7 was knocked down, which could not be rescued by the extracted liquids of B-MBG scaffolds confirming its role in osteoblast differentiation and bone regeneration. As a histone methylase, Setd7 may be expected to be a potential epigenetic target for new treatment schemes of osteoporosis. Statement of Significance Boron-containing MBG scaffold has already been proved to promote bone regeneration in femoral defects of OVX rats by our research group, however, the epigenetic mechanism of Boron's positive effects on bone generation remains ill-informed. In our present study, we found an increased expression and affiliation of Setd7 and H3K4me3 in Runx2-positive osteoblasts in vivo. And in vitro, the higher expression of Setd7 enhanced osteogenic differentiation of human BMSCs stimulated by extracted liquids of B-MBG scaffold compared to MBG scaffold, which was associated with the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Above all, it suggests that Setd7 plays an positive role in osteogenic differentiation and it may become a potential epigenetic target for new schemes for osteoporosis. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB  - Preeclampsia is one of the most dangerous pregnancy complications, and the leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Although the clinical symptoms appear late, its origin is early, and hence detection is feasible already at the first trimester. In the current study, we investigated the abundance of circulating small non-coding RNAs in the plasma of pregnant women in their first trimester, seeking transcripts that best separate the preeclampsia samples from those of healthy pregnant women. To this end, we performed small non-coding RNAs sequencing of 75 preeclampsia and control samples, and identified 25 transcripts that were differentially expressed between preeclampsia and the control groups. Furthermore, we utilized those transcripts and created a pipeline for a supervised classification of preeclampsia. Our pipeline generates a logistic regression model using a 5-fold cross validation on numerous random partitions into training and blind test sets. Using this classification procedure, we achieved an average AUC value of 0.86. These findings suggest the predictive value of circulating small non-coding RNA in the first trimester, warranting further examination, and lay the foundation for producing a novel early non-invasive diagnostic tool for preeclampsia, which could reduce the life-threatening risk for both the mother and fetus.

AB  - Background: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection leads to liver fibrosis, which is a major risk factor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and an independent risk factor of recurrence after HCC tumor resection. The HBV genome can be inserted into the human genome, and chronic inflammation may trigger somatic mutations. However, how HBV integration and other genomic changes contribute to the risk of tumor recurrence with regards to the different degree of liver fibrosis is not clearly understood. Methods: We sequenced mRNAs of 21 pairs of tumor and distant non-neoplastic liver tissues of HBV-HCC patients and performed comprehensive genomic analyses of our RNAseq data and public available HBV-HCC sequencing data. Results: We developed a robust pipeline for sensitively identifying HBV integration sites based on sequencing data. Simulations showed that our method outperformed existing methods. Applying it to our data, 374 and 106 HBV host genes were identified in non-neoplastic liver and tumor tissues, respectively. When applying it to other RNA sequencing datasets, consistently more HBV integrations were identified in non-neoplastic liver than in tumor tissues. HBV host genes identified in non-neoplastic liver samples significantly overlapped with known tumor suppressor genes. More significant enrichment of tumor suppressor genes was observed among HBV host genes identified from patients with tumor recurrence, indicating the potential risk of tumor recurrence driven by HBV integration in non-neoplastic liver tissues. We also compared SNPs of each sample with SNPs in a cancer census database and inferred samples' pathogenic SNP loads. Pathogenic SNP loads in non-neoplastic liver tissues were consistently higher than those in normal liver tissues. Additionally, HBV host genes identified in non-neoplastic liver tissues significantly overlapped with pathogenic somatic mutations, suggesting that HBV integration and somatic mutations targeting the same set of genes are important to tumorigenesis. HBV integrations and pathogenic mutations showed distinct patterns between low and high liver fibrosis patients with regards to tumor recurrence. Conclusions: The results suggest that HBV integrations and pathogenic SNPs in non-neoplastic tissues are important for tumorigenesis and different recurrence risk models are needed for patients with low and high degrees of liver fibrosis.

AB  - The advent of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has led to the discovery of unprecedentedly immense transcriptomes encoded by eukaryotic genomes. However, the transcriptome maps are still incomplete partly because they were mostly reconstructed based on RNA-seq reads that lack their orientations (known as unstranded reads) and certain boundary information. Methods to expand the usability of unstranded RNA-seq data by predetermining the orientation of the reads and precisely determining the boundaries of assembled transcripts could significantly benefit the quality of the resulting transcriptome maps. Here, we present a high-performing transcriptome assembly pipeline, called CAFE, that significantly improves the original assemblies, respectively assembled with stranded and/or unstranded RNA-seq data, by orienting unstranded reads using the maximum likelihood estimation and by integrating information about transcription start sites and cleavage and polyadenylation sites. Applying large-scale transcriptomic data comprising 230 billion RNA-seq reads from the ENCODE, Human BodyMap 2.0, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and GTEx projects, CAFE enabled us to predict the directions of about 220 billion unstranded reads, which led to the construction of more accurate transcriptome maps, comparable to the manually curated map, and a comprehensive lncRNA catalog that includes thousands of novel lncRNAs. Our pipeline should not only help to build comprehensive, precise transcriptome maps from complex genomes but also to expand the universe of noncoding genomes.

AB  - Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a well-known small RNA (sRNA) species with important regulatory roles. To date, several bioinformatics tools have been developed for large-scale prediction of miRNAs based on high-throughput sequencing data. However, some of these tools become invalid without reference genomes, while some tools cannot supply user-friendly outputs. Besides, most of the current tools focus on the importance of secondary structures and sRNA expression patterns for miRNA prediction, while they do not pay attention to miRNA processing for reliability check. Results: Here, we reported a pipeline PmiRDiscVali for plant miRNA discovery and partial validation. This pipeline integrated the popular tool miRDeep-P for plant miRNA prediction, making PmiRDiscVali compatible for both reference-based and de novo predictions. To check the prediction reliability, we adopted the concept that the miRNA processing intermediates could be tracked by degradome sequencing (degradome-seq) during the development of PmiRDiscVali. A case study was performed by using the public sequencing data of Dendrobium officinale, in order to show the clear and concise presentation of the prediction results. Conclusion: Summarily, the integrated pipeline PmiRDiscVali, featured with degradome-seq data-based validation and vivid result presentation, should be useful for large-scale identification of plant miRNA candidates.

The recent availability of high-throughput RNA-seq sequencing has made genome-wide detecting and quantifying of the novel, rare and low-abundance transcripts practical. However, its potential merits in reconstructing gene co-expression network have still not been well explored. Using massive-scale RNA-seq samples, we have designed an ensemble pipeline, called NetMiner, for building genome-scale and high-quality Gene Co-expression Network (GCN) by integrating three frequently used inference algorithms. We constructed a RNA-seq-based GCN in one species of monocot rice. The quality of network obtained by our method was verified and evaluated by the curated gene functional association data sets, which obviously outperformed each single method. In addition, the powerful capability of network for associating genes with functions and agronomic traits was shown by enrichment analysis and case studies. In particular, we demonstrated the potential value of our proposed method to predict the biological roles of unknown protein-coding genes, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes and circular RNA (circRNA) genes. Our results provided a valuable and highly reliable data source to select key candidate genes for subsequent experimental validation. To facilitate identification of novel genes regulating important biological processes and phenotypes in other plants or animals, we have published the source code of NetMiner, making it freely available at https://github.com/czllab/NetMiner.

AB  - Forward genetic screens using retroviral (or transposon) gene-trap vectors in a haploid genome revolutionized the investigation of molecular networks in mammals. However, the sequencing data generated by Phenotypic interrogation followed by Tag sequencing (PhiT-seq) were not well characterized. The analysis of human and mouse haploid screens allowed us to describe PhiT-seq data and to define quality control steps. Moreover, we identified several blind spots in both haploid genomes where gene-trap vectors can hardly integrate. Integration of transcriptomic data improved the performance of candidate gene identification. Furthermore, we experimented with various statistical tests to account for biological replicates in PhiT-seq and investigated the effect of normalization methods and other parameters on the performance.

AB  - Background: RNA sequencing technique (RNA-seq) enables scientists to develop novel data-driven methods for discovering more unidentified lincRNAs. Meantime, knowledge-based technologies are experiencing a potential revolution ignited by the new deep learning methods. By scanning the newly found data set from RNA-seq, scientists have found that: (1) the expression of lincRNAs appears to be regulated, that is, the relevance exists along the DNA sequences; (2) lincRNAs contain some conversed patterns/motifs tethered together by non-conserved regions. The two evidences give the reasoning for adopting knowledge-based deep learning methods in lincRNA detection. Similar to coding region transcription, non-coding regions are split at transcriptional sites. However, regulatory RNAs rather than message RNAs are generated. That is, the transcribed RNAs participate the biological process as regulatory units instead of generating proteins. Identifying these transcriptional regions from non-coding regions is the first step towards lincRNA recognition. Results: The auto-encoder method achieves 100% and 92.4% prediction accuracy on transcription sites over the putative data sets. The experimental results also show the excellent performance of predictive deep neural network on the lincRNA data sets compared with support vector machine and traditional neural network. In addition, it is validated through the newly discovered lincRNA data set and one unreported transcription site is found by feeding the whole annotated sequences through the deep learning machine, which indicates that deep learning method has the extensive ability for lincRNA prediction. Conclusions: The transcriptional sequences of lincRNAs are collected from the annotated human DNA genome data. Subsequently, a two-layer deep neural network is developed for the lincRNA detection, which adopts the auto-encoder algorithm and utilizes different encoding schemes to obtain the best performance over intergenic DNA sequence data. Driven by those newly annotated lincRNA data, deep learning methods based on auto-encoder algorithm can exert their capability in knowledge learning in order to capture the useful features and the information correlation along DNA genome sequences for lincRNA detection. As our knowledge, this is the first application to adopt the deep learning techniques for identifying lincRNA transcription sequences.

AB  - BackgroundThe etiology of more than half of all patients with X-linked intellectual disability remains elusive, despite array-based comparative genomic hybridization, whole exome or genome sequencing. Since short read massive parallel sequencing approaches do not allow the detection of larger tandem repeat expansions, we hypothesized that such expansions could be a hidden cause of X-linked intellectual disability.MethodsWe selectively captured over 1800 tandem repeats on the X chromosome and characterized them by long read single molecule sequencing in 3 families with idiopathic X-linked intellectual disability.ResultsIn male DNA samples, full tandem repeat length sequences were obtained for 88-93% of the targets and up to 99.6% of the repeats with a moderate guanine-cytosine content. Read length and analysis pipeline allow to detect cases of >900bp tandem repeat expansion. In one family, one repeat expansion co-occurs with down-regulation of the neighboring MIR222 gene. This gene has previously been implicated in intellectual disability and is apparently linked to FMR1 and NEFH overexpression associated with neurological disorders.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the power of single molecule sequencing to measure tandem repeat lengths and detect expansions, and suggests that tandem repeat mutations may be a hidden cause of X-linked intellectual disability.

AB  - After an impressively successful application as a research instrument, whole-exome sequencing (WES) now enters the clinical practice due to its high diagnostic, time, and economic efficiency. WES is the diagnostic method of choice for symptoms that may be due to many different monogenic causes. Neurological indications include movement disorders, especially in cases of early symptom onset, familial clustering and complex manifestation. Starting from ablood sample, enrichment and sequencing of the exome enable the examination of all coding DNA regions for point mutations and small insertions/deletions. The identification of variants as the cause of adisease requires aprofessional evaluation pipeline, variant prioritization schemes and variant classification databases. Whereas many variants can be reliably classified as pathogenic or benign, variants of unclear significance (VUS) remain achallenge for the clinical evaluation and necessitate aperiodic reanalysis of WES data. As agenetic examination WES requires adequate patient informed consent which in particular should address possible secondary findings as well as data security. Apositive molecular result ends diagnostic odysseys, enables accurate genetic counseling and can point to targeted preventive measures and treatment. A WES significantly contributes to the understanding of the genetic architecture and pathophysiology of neurological diseases, enriching and enabling precision medicine.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most economically important swine pathogens and causes reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease in growing pigs. PRRSV mainly infects porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), leading to the subversion of innate and adaptive immunity of pigs. The transcriptome analysis of gene expression profiles in PRRSV-infected PAMs is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of PRRSV. Here we performed next-generation RNA sequencing and a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to characterize the dynamic transcriptome landscapes in PAMs following PRRSV infection. Totally 38222 annotated mRNAs, 12987 annotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 17624 novel lncRNAs in PRRSV-infected PAMs were identified through a transcripts computational identification pipeline. The differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs during PRRSV infection were characterized. Several differentially expressed transcripts were validated using qRT-PCR. Analyses on dynamic overrepresented GO terms and KEGG pathways in PRRSV-infected PAMs at different time points were performed. Meanwhile the genes involved in IFN-related signaling pathways, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation and processing were significantly downregulated, indicating the aberrant function of PAMs during PRRSV infection. Moreover, the differentially and highly expressed lncRNA XR_297549.1 was predicted to both cis-regulate and trans-regulate its neighboring gene, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), indicating its role in inflammatory response. Our findings reveal the transcriptome profiles and differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in PRRSV-infected PAMs in vitro, providing valuable information for further exploration of PRRSV pathogenesis.

AB  - BackgroundNormal tissue samples are often employed as a control for understanding disease mechanisms, however, collecting matched normal tissues from patients is difficult in many instances. In cancer research, for example, the open cancer resources such as TCGA and TARGET do not provide matched tissue samples for every cancer or cancer subtype. The recent GTEx project has profiled samples from healthy individuals, providing an excellent resource for this field, yet the feasibility of using GTEx samples as the reference remains unanswered.MethodsWe analyze RNA-Seq data processed from the same computational pipeline and systematically evaluate GTEx as a potential reference resource. We use those cancers that have adjacent normal tissues in TCGA as a benchmark for the evaluation. To correlate tumor samples and normal samples, we explore top varying genes, reduced features from principal component analysis, and encoded features from an autoencoder neural network. We first evaluate whether these methods can identify the correct tissue of origin from GTEx for a given cancer and then seek to answer whether disease expression signatures are consistent between those derived from TCGA and from GTEx.ResultsAmong 32 TCGA cancers, 18 cancers have less than 10 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. Among three methods, autoencoder performed the best in predicting tissue of origin, with 12 of 14 cancers correctly predicted. The reason for misclassification of two cancers is that none of normal samples from GTEx correlate well with any tumor samples in these cancers. This suggests that GTEx has matched tissues for the majority cancers, but not all. While using autoencoder to select proper normal samples for disease signature creation, we found that disease signatures derived from normal samples selected via an autoencoder from GTEx are consistent with those derived from adjacent samples from TCGA in many cases. Interestingly, choosing top 50 mostly correlated samples regardless of tissue type performed reasonably well or even better in some cancers.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that samples from GTEx can serve as reference normal samples for cancers, especially those do not have available adjacent tissue samples. A deep-learning based approach holds promise to select proper normal samples.

AB  - Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming a standard experimental methodology for genome-wide characterization and quantification of transcripts at single base-pair resolution. However, downstream analysis of massive amount of sequencing data can be prohibitively technical for wet-lab researchers. A functionally integrated and user-friendly platform is required to meet this demand. Here, we present iSeq, an R-based Web server, for RNA-seq data analysis and visualization. iSeq is a streamlined Web-based R application under the Shiny framework, featuring a simple user interface and multiple data analysis modules. Users without programming and statistical skills can analyze their RNA-seq data and construct publication-level graphs through a standardized yet customizable analytical pipeline. iSeq is accessible via Web browsers on any operating system at http://iseq.cbi.pku.edu.cn.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential metallic element with potentially deleterious effects on plants, animals, and human health. Many studies have indicated that nitrogen (N) application can effectively alleviate Cd toxicity in plants. However, the function of nitrogen in this process remains unclear. In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing and comparative analysis were carried out on poplar (Populus cathayana Rehd) trees treated with only Cd or co-treated with N and Cd, and both treatments were compared against a negative control (no Cd or N) and plants treated with only N. The results showed that approximately 48045828, 46712688, 46681202, and 48076990 clean reads were obtained in the control, Cd, N + Cd, and N treatments. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis (KEGG) indicated that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) could be classified primarily into 144 pathways, among which 19 were related to heavy metal transportation and cell detoxification. The up- and down-regulated DEGs were predominately involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis, cysteine (Cys), glycine (Gly), brassinosteroid (BR), and salicylic acid (SA)-related pathways. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed that the expression profiles of DEGs were consistent with the results from RNA sequencing analysis. Eight candidate genes encoding GSH, Cys, Gly, BR, and SA were associated with detoxification of Cd and were selected for further screening. A schematic model to explain the involvement of DEGs and N in the Cd-responsive regulatory network is proposed. This study represents the first comprehensive transcriptome-based characterization of N- and Cd-responsive DEGs in poplar. These results provide fundamental insight into the molecular mechanism of N assistance in Cd detoxification. In addition, the results of this study build a solid foundation for further genetic manipulation of Cd accumulation in plants and for the development of phytoremediation approaches to reclaim Cd-contaminated soils.

AB  - In eukaryotes, alternative splicing (AS) greatly expands the diversity of transcripts. However, it is challenging to accurately determine full-length splicing isoforms. Recently, more studies have taken advantage of Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) long-read sequencing to identify full-length transcripts. Nevertheless, the high error rate of PacBio reads seriously offsets the advantages of long reads, especially for accurately identifying splicing junctions. To best capitalize on the features of long reads, we used Illumina RNA-seq reads to improve PacBio circular consensus sequence (CCS) quality and to validate splicing patterns in the rice transcriptome. We evaluated the impact of CCS accuracy on the number and the validation rate of splicing isoforms, and integrated a comprehensive pipeline of splicing transcripts analysis by Iso-Seq and RNA-seq (STAIR) to identify the full-length multi-exon isoforms in rice seedling transcriptome (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica). STAIR discovered 11 733 full-length multi-exon isoforms, 6599 more than the SMRT Portal RS_IsoSeq pipeline did. Of these splicing isoforms identified, 4453 (37.9%) were missed in assembled transcripts from RNA-seq reads, and 5204 (44.4%), including 268 multi-exon long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), were not reported in the MSU_osa1r7 annotation. Some randomly selected unreported splicing junctions were verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. In addition, we investigated alternative polyadenylation (APA) events in transcripts and identified 829 major polyadenylation [poly(A)] site clusters (PACs). The analysis of splicing isoforms and APA events will facilitate the annotation of the rice genome and studies on the expression and polyadenylation of AS genes in different developmental stages or growth conditions of rice.

AB  - Small RNA sequencing is the most widely used tool for microRNA (miRNA) discovery, and shows great potential for the efficient study of miRNA cross-species transport, i.e., by detecting the presence of exogenous miRNA sequences in the host species. Because of the increased appreciation of dietary miRNAs and their far-reaching implication in human health, research interests are currently growing with regard to exogenous miRNAs bioavailability, mechanisms of cross-species transport and miRNA function in cellular biological processes. In this article, we present microRNA Discovery (miRDis), a new small RNA sequencing data analysis pipeline for both endogenous and exogenous miRNA detection. Specifically, we developed and deployed a Web service that supports the annotation and expression profiling data of known host miRNAs and the detection of novel miRNAs, other noncoding RNAs, and the exogenous miRNAs from dietary species. As a proof-of-concept, we analyzed a set of human plasma sequencing data from a milk-feeding study where 225 human miRNAs were detected in the plasma samples and 44 show elevated expression after milk intake. By examining the bovine-specific sequences, data indicate that three bovine miRNAs (bta-miR-378, -181* and -150) are present in human plasma possibly because of the dietary uptake. Further evaluation based on different sets of public data demonstrates that miRDis outperforms other state-of-the-art tools in both detection and quantification of miRNA from either animal or plant sources. The miRDis Web server is available at: http://sbbi.unl.edu/miRDis/index.php.

AB  - Background: With the recent proliferation of single-cell RNA-Seq experiments, several methods have been developed for unsupervised analysis of the resulting datasets. These methods often rely on unintuitive hyperparameters and do not explicitly address the subjectivity associated with clustering. Results: In this work, we present DendroSplit, an interpretable framework for analyzing single-cell RNA-Seq datasets that addresses both the clustering interpretability and clustering subjectivity issues. DendroSplit offers a novel perspective on the single-cell RNA-Seq clustering problem motivated by the definition of "cell type", allowing us to cluster using feature selection to uncover multiple levels of biologically meaningful populations in the data. We analyze several landmark single-cell datasets, demonstrating both the method's efficacy and computational efficiency. Conclusion: DendroSplit offers a clustering framework that is comparable to existing methods in terms of accuracy and speed but is novel in its emphasis on interpretabilty.

AB  - BackgroundGastric cancer (GC) ranks the second in mortality rate among all cancers. Metastases account for most of the deaths in GC patients. Yet our understanding of GC and its metastasis mechanism is still very limited.MethodsWe performed 20 whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 5 typical metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) patients with lymph node metastasis. We compared both the primary tumors to their metastatic lymph nodes, and a specific analysis pipeline was used to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels) and copy number variants (CNVs).Results(1) We confirmed 30 candidate mutations in both primary and lymph nodes tissues, and other 7 only in primary tumors. (2) Copy number gains were observed in a large section of 17q12-21, as well as copy number losses in regions containing CDKN2A and CDKN2B in both primary and lymph nodes tissues.ConclusionsOur results provide preliminary insights in the molecular mechanisms of GC initiation, development, and metastatic progression. These results need to be validated through large-scale studies.

AB  - BackgroundInteractions among transcription factors (TFs) and histone modifications (HMs) play an important role in the precise regulation of gene expression. The context specificity of those interactions and further its dynamics in normal and disease remains largely unknown. Recent development in genomics technology enables transcription profiling by RNA-seq and protein's binding profiling by ChIP-seq. Integrative analysis of the two types of data allows us to investigate TFs and HMs interactions both from the genome co-localization and downstream target gene expression.ResultsWe propose a integrative pipeline to explore the co-localization of 55 TFs and 11 HMs and its dynamics in human GM12878 and K562 by matched ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from ENCODE. We classify TFs and HMs into three types based on their binding enrichment around transcription start site (TSS). Then a set of statistical indexes are proposed to characterize the TF-TF and TF-HM co-localizations. We found that Rad21, SMC3, and CTCF co-localized across five cell lines. High resolution Hi-C data in GM12878 shows that they associate most of the Hi-C peak loci with a specific CTCF-motif anchor and supports that CTCF, SMC3, and RAD2 co-localization serves important role in 3D chromatin structure. Meanwhile, 17 TF-TF pairs are highly dynamic between GM12878 and K562. We then build SVM models to correlate high and low expression level of target genes with TF binding and HM strength. We found that H3k9ac, H3k27ac, and three TFs (ELF1, TAF1, and POL2) are predictive with the accuracy about 8592%.ConclusionWe propose a pipeline to analyze the co-localization of TF and HM and their dynamics across cell lines from ChIP-seq, and investigate their regulatory potency by RNA-seq. The integrative analysis of two level data reveals new insight for the cooperation of TFs and HMs and is helpful in understanding cell line specificity of TF/HM interactions.

AB  - RNA editing is a posttranscriptional modification process that alters the sequence of RNA molecules. RNA editing is related to many human diseases. However, the identification of RNA editing sites typically requires matched genomic sequence or multiple related expression data sets. Here we describe the GIREMI tool (genome-independent identification of RNA editing by mutual information; https://github.com/zhqingit/giremi) that is designed to accurately and sensitively predict adenosine-to-inosine editing from a single RNA-Seq data set.

AB  - Alternative splicing generates multiple transcript and protein isoforms from the same gene and thus is important in gene expression regulation. To date, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is the standard method for quantifying changes in alternative splicing on a genome-wide scale. Understanding the current limitations of RNA-seq is crucial for reliable analysis and the lack of high quality, comprehensive transcriptomes for most species, including model organisms such as Arabidopsis, is a major constraint in accurate quantification of transcript isoforms. To address this, we designed a novel pipeline with stringent filters and assembled a comprehensive Reference Transcript Dataset for Arabidopsis (AtRTD2) containing 82,190 non-redundant transcripts from 34 212 genes. Extensive experimental validation showed that AtRTD2 and its modified version, AtRTD2-QUASI, for use in Quantification of Alternatively Spliced Isoforms, outperform other available transcriptomes in RNA-seq analysis. This strategy can be implemented in other species to build a pipeline for transcript-level expression and alternative splicing analyses.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary exposure to aflatoxin is an important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, little is known about the genomic features and mutations of aflatoxin-associated HCCs compared with HCCs not associated with aflatoxin exposure. We investigated the genetic features of aflatoxin-associated HCC that can be used to differentiate them from HCCs not associated with this carcinogen. METHODS: We obtained HCC tumor tissues and matched non-tumor liver tissues from 49 patients, collected from 1990 through 2016, at the Qidong Liver Cancer Hospital Institute in China-a high-risk region for aflatoxin exposure (38.2% of food samples test positive for aflatoxin contamination). Somatic variants were identified using GATK Best Practices Pipeline. We validated part of the mutations from whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing by Sanger sequencing. We also analyzed genomes of 1072 HCCs, obtained from 5 datasets from China, the United States, France, and Japan. Mutations in 49 aflatoxin-associated HCCs and 1072 HCCs from other regions were analyzed using the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute mutational signatures framework with non-negative matrix factorization. The mutation landscape and mutational signatures from the aflatoxin-associated HCC and HCC samples from general population were compared. We identified genetic features of aflatoxin-associated HCC, and used these to identify aflatoxin-associated HCCs in datasets from other regions. Tumor samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry to determine microvessel density and levels of CD34 and CD274 (PD-L1). RESULTS: Aflatoxin-associated HCCs frequently contained C>A transversions, the sequence motif GCN, and strand bias. In addition to previously reported mutations in TP53, we found frequent mutations in the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B1 gene (ADGRB1), which were associated with increased capillary density of tumor tissue. Aflatoxin-associated HCC tissues contained high-level potential mutation-associated neoantigens, and many infiltrating lymphocytes and tumors cells that expressed PD-L1, compared to HCCs not associated with aflatoxin. Of the HCCs from China, 9.8% contained the aflatoxin-associated genetic features, whereas 0.4%-3.5% of HCCs from other regions contained these genetic features. CONCLUSIONS: We identified specific genetic and mutation features of HCCs associated with aflatoxin exposure, including mutations in ADGRB1, compared to HCCs from general populations. We associated these mutations with increased vascularization and expression of PD-L1 in HCC tissues. These findings might be used to identify patients with HCC due to aflatoxin exposure, and select therapies.

AB  - Since its establishment in 2009, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been a major driver behind progress in biomedical research. In developmental biology and stem cell studies, the ability to profile single cells confers particular benefits. Although most studies still focus on individual tissues or organs, the recent development of ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq has demonstrated potential power in characterizing more complex systems or even the entire body. However, although multiple ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems have attracted attention, no systematic comparison of these systems has been performed. Here, with the same cell line and bioinformatics pipeline, we developed directly comparable datasets for each of three widely used droplet-based ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems, inDrop, Drop-seq, and 10X Genomics Chromium. Although each system is capable of profiling single-cell transcriptomes, their detailed comparison revealed the distinguishing features and suitable applications for each system.

AB  - Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in various cellular activities and diseases. In this paper, we presented a comprehensive review on computational methods for ncRNA prediction, which are generally grouped into four categories: (1) homology-based methods, that is, comparative methods involving evolutionarily conserved RNA sequences and structures, (2) de novo methods using RNA sequence and structure features, (3) transcriptional sequencing and assembling based methods, that is, methods designed for single and pair-ended reads generated from next-generation RNA sequencing, and (4) RNA family specific methods, for example, methods specific for microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs. In the end, we summarized the advantages and limitations of these methods and pointed out a few possible future directions for ncRNA prediction. In conclusion, many computational methods have been demonstrated to be effective in predicting ncRNAs for further experimental validation. They are critical in reducing the huge number of potential ncRNAs and pointing the community to high confidence candidates. In the future, high efficient mapping technology and more intrinsic sequence features (e.g., motif and k-mer frequencies) and structure features (e.g., minimum free energy, conserved stem-loop, or graph structures) are suggested to be combined with the next- and third-generation sequencing platforms to improve ncRNA prediction.

AB  - Motivation: Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEAs) are widely used in genomic research to identify underlying biological mechanisms (defined by the gene sets), such as Gene Ontology terms and molecular pathways. There are two caveats in the currently available methods: (i) they are typically designed for group comparisons or regression analyses, which do not utilize temporal information efficiently in time-series of transcriptomics measurements; and (ii) genes overlapping in multiple molecular pathways are considered multiple times in hypothesis testing. Results: We propose an inferential framework for GSEA based on functional data analysis, which utilizes the temporal information based on functional principal component analysis, and disentangles the effects of overlapping genes by a functional extension of the elastic-net regression. Furthermore, the hypothesis testing for the gene sets is performed by an extension of Mann-Whitney U test which is based on weighted rank sums computed from correlated observations. By using both simulated datasets and a large-scale time-course gene expression data on human influenza infection, we demonstrate that our method has uniformly better receiver operating characteristic curves, and identifies more pathways relevant to immune-response to human influenza infection than the competing approaches.

AB  - Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) are profound in cancer genomes at different stages: oncogenesis, progression, and metastasis. Accurate detection and characterization of SCNA landscape at genome-wide scale are of great importance. Next-generation sequencing and SNP array are current technology of choice for SCNA analysis. They are able to quantify SCNA with high resolution and meanwhile raise great challenges in data analysis. To this end, we have developed an R package saasCNV for SCNA analysis using (1) whole-genome sequencing (WGS), (2) whole-exome sequencing (WES) or (3) whole-genome SNP array data. In this chapter, we provide the features of the package and step-by-step instructions in detail.

AB  - An increasing number of single cell transcriptome and epigenome technologies, including single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq), have been recently developed as powerful tools to analyze the features of many individual cells simultaneously. However, the methods and software were designed for one certain data type and only for single cell transcriptome data. A systematic approach for epigenome data and multiple types of transcriptome data is needed to control data quality and to perform cell-to-cell heterogeneity analysis on these ultra-high-dimensional transcriptome and epigenome datasets. Here we developed Dr. seq2, a Quality Control (QC) and analysis pipeline for multiple types of single cell transcriptome and epigenome data, including scATAC-seq and Drop-ChIP data. Application of this pipeline provides four groups of QC measurements and different analyses, including cell heterogeneity analysis. Dr. seq2 produced reliable results on published single cell transcriptome and epigenome datasets. Overall, Dr. seq2 is a systematic and comprehensive QC and analysis pipeline designed for parallel single cell transcriptome and epigenome data.

AB  - Rattan is an important group of regenerating non-wood climbing palm in tropical forests. The cirrus is an essential climbing organ and provides morphological evidence for evolutionary and taxonomic studies. However, limited data are available on the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of the cirrus. Thus, we performed in-depth transcriptomic sequencing analyses to characterize the cirrus development at different developmental stages of Daemonorops jenkinsiana. The result showed 404,875 transcripts were assembled, including 61,569 high-quality unigenes were identified, of which approximately 76.16% were annotated and classified by seven authorized databases. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of the gene expression profiles identified differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) concentrated in developmental pathways, cell wall metabolism, and hook formation between the different stages of the cirri. Among them, 37 DEGs were validated by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, 14,693 transcriptome-based microsatellites were identified. Of the 168 designed SSR primer pairs, 153 were validated and 16 pairs were utilized for the polymorphic analysis of 25 rattan accessions. These findings can be used to interpret the molecular mechanisms of cirrus development, and the developed microsatellites markers provide valuable data for assisting rattan taxonomy and expanding the understanding of genomic study in rattan.

AB  - Fusion gene derived from genomic rearrangement plays a key role in cancer initiation. The discovery of novel gene fusions may be of significant importance in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Meanwhile, next generation sequencing technology provide a sensitive and efficient way to identify gene fusions in genomic levels. However, there are still many challenges and limitations remaining in the existing methods which only rely on unmapped reads or discordant alignment fragments. In this work we have developed GFusion, a novel method using RNA-Seq data, to identify the fusion genes. This pipeline performs multiple alignments and strict filtering algorithm to improve sensitivity and reduce the false positive rate. GFusion successfully detected 34 from 43 previously reported fusions in four cancer datasets. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of GFusion using 24 million 76 bp paired-end reads simulation data which contains 42 artificial fusion genes, among which GFusion successfully discovered 37 fusion genes. Compared with existing methods, GFusion presented higher sensitivity and lower false positive rate. The GFusion pipeline can be accessed freely for non-commercial purposes at: https://github.com/xiaofengsong/GFusion.

AB  - Background: Genome-wide miRNA expression data can be used to study miRNA dysregulation comprehensively. Although many open-source tools for microRNA (miRNA)-seq data analyses are available, challenges remain in accurate miRNA quantification from large-scale miRNA-seq dataset. We implemented a pipeline called QuickMIRSeq for accurate quantification of known miRNAs and miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) from multiple samples simultaneously. Results: QuickMIRSeq considers the unique nature of miRNAs and combines many important features into its implementation. First, it takes advantage of high redundancy of miRNA reads and introduces joint mapping of multiple samples to reduce computational time. Second, it incorporates the strand information in the alignment step for more accurate quantification. Third, reads potentially arising from background noise are filtered out to improve the reliability of miRNA detection. Fourth, sequences aligned to miRNAs with mismatches are remapped to a reference genome to further reduce false positives. Finally, QuickMIRSeq generates a rich set of QC metrics and publication-ready plots. Conclusions: The rich visualization features implemented allow end users to interactively explore the results and gain more insights into miRNA-seq data analyses. The high degree of automation and interactivity in QuickMIRSeq leads to a substantial reduction in the time and effort required for miRNA-seq data analysis.

AB  - Gene post-transcription regulation involves several critical regulators such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Accumulated experimental evidences have shown that miRNAs and RBPs can competitively regulate the shared targeting transcripts. Although this establishes a novel post-transcription regulation mechanism, there are currently no computational tools to scan for the possible competing miRNA and RBP pairs. Here, we developed a novel computational pipeline-RBPvsMIR-that enables us to statistically evaluate the competing relationship between miRNAs and RBPs. RBPvsMIR first combines with previously successful miRNAs and RBP motifs discovery applications to search for overlapping or adjacent binding sites along a given RNA sequence. Then a permutation test is performed to select the miRNA and RBP pairs with the significantly enriched binding sites. As an example, we used RBPvsMIR to identify 235 competing RBP-miRNA pairs for long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MALAT1. Wet lab experiments verified that splicing factor SRSF2 competes with miR-383, miR-502 and miR-101 to regulate MALAT1 in esophageal squamous carcinoma cells. Our study also revealed the global mutual exclusive pattern for miRNAs and RBP to regulate human lncRNAs. In addition, we provided a convenient web server (http://bmc.med.stu.edu.cn/RBPvsMIR), which should accelerate the exploration of competing miRNAs and RBP pairs regulating the shared targeting transcripts.

AB  - BackgroundSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been applied as important molecular markers in genetics and breeding studies. The rapid advance of next generation sequencing (NGS) provides a high-throughput means of SNP discovery. However, SNP development is limited by the availability of reliable SNP discovery methods. Especially, the optimum assembler and SNP caller for accurate SNP prediction from next generation sequencing data are not known.ResultsHerein we performed SNP prediction based on RNA-seq data of peach and mandarin peel tissue under a comprehensive comparison of two paired-end read lengths (125bp and 150bp), five assemblers (Trinity, IDBA, oases, SOAPdenovo, Trans-abyss) and two SNP callers (GATK and GBS). The predicted SNPs were compared with the authentic SNPs identified via PCR amplification followed by gene cloning and sequencing procedures. A total of 40 and 240 authentic SNPs were presented in five anthocyanin biosynthesis related genes in peach and in nine carotenogenic genes in mandarin. Putative SNPs predicted from the same RNA-seq data with different strategies led to quite divergent results. The rate of false positive SNPs was significantly lower when the paired-end read length was 150bp compared with 125bp. Trinity was superior to the other four assemblers and GATK was substantially superior to GBS due to a low rate of missing authentic SNPs. The combination of assembler Trinity, SNP caller GATK, and the paired-end read length 150bp had the best performance in SNP discovery with 100% accuracy both in peach and in mandarin cases. This strategy was applied to the characterization of SNPs in peach and mandarin transcriptomes.ConclusionsThrough comparison of authentic SNPs obtained by PCR cloning strategy and putative SNPs predicted from different combinations of five assemblers, two SNP callers, and two paired-end read lengths, we provided a reliable and efficient strategy, Trinity-GATK with 150bp paired-end read length, for SNP discovery from RNA-seq data. This strategy discovered SNP at 100% accuracy in peach and mandarin cases and might be applicable to a wide range of plants and other organisms.

AB  - Background. Researches on immunotherapy of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, WHO grade IV) have increased exponentially in recent years. As a targeted therapy, a series of biomarkers have been identified in local tumor tissue, while circulating marker which could be detected in the body fluids is still lacking. ADAMTSL4, a secreted glycoprotein, was earlier found to play a critical role in a prognostic signature for primary GBM (pGBM). We aimed to investigate the role of ADAMTSL4 at transcriptome level and its relationship with clinical practice in pGBM. Methods. A cohort of 88 pGBM patients with RNA-seq data from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) was analyzed, and 168 pGBM patients from TCGA were included as validation. Several bioinformatic methods and predictive tools were applied to investigate the ADAMTSL4-associated immune microenvironment status. Results. We found that ADAMTSL4 was enriched in GBM (WHO grade IV), especially for those with IDH1/2 wild-type and MGMT unmethylated groups. According to the TCGA classification scheme, ADAMTSL4 can act as a potential marker for subtypes with poorer prognosis. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that ADAMTSL4 was significantly correlated to the immune-related processes in GBM (WHO grade IV), especially representing the infiltration of immune cells and complicated tumor microenvironment. Clinically, high expression of ADAMTSL4 was an independent indicator for poor prognosis. Conclusion. The expression of ADAMTSL4 is closely related to the clinicopathologic characteristics of pGBM. Meanwhile, it may play a critical role in immune-related processes. As a secreted glycoprotein, ADAMTSL4 is a promising circulating biomarker for pGBM, deserving further investigations.

AB  - Motivation: Deep sequencing based ribosome footprint profiling can provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of protein translation. However, the observed ribosome profile is fundamentally confounded by transcriptional activity. In order to decipher principles of translation regulation, tools that can reliably detect changes in translation efficiency in case-control studies are needed. Results: We present a statistical framework and an analysis tool, RiboDiff, to detect genes with changes in translation efficiency across experimental treatments. RiboDiff uses generalized linear models to estimate the over-dispersion of RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling measurements separately, and performs a statistical test for differential translation efficiency using both mRNA abundance and ribosome occupancy.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of diverse cellular processes. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have allowed for an unprecedented discovery of novel lncRNAs. To identify functional lncRNAs from thousands of candidates for further functional validation is still a challenging task. Here, we present a novel computational framework, lncFunNet (lncRNA Functional inference through integrated Network) that integrates ChIP-seq, CLIP-seq and RNA-seq data to predict, prioritize and annotate lncRNA functions. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), using lncFunNet we not only recovered most of the functional lncRNAs known to maintain mESC pluripotency but also predicted a plethora of novel functional lncRNAs. Similarly, in mousemyoblast C2C12 cells, applying lncFunNet led to prediction of reservoirs of functional lncRNAs in both proliferating myoblasts (MBs) and differentiating myotubes (MTs). Further analyses demonstrated that these lncRNAs are frequently bound by key transcription factors, interact with miRNAs and constitute key nodes in biological network motifs. Further experimentations validated their dynamic expression profiles and functionality duringmyoblast differentiation. Collectively, our studies demonstrate the use of lncFunNet to annotate and identify functional lncRNAs in a given biological system.

AB  - Background: RNA-Seq has become one of the most widely used applications based on next-generation sequencing technology. However, raw RNA-Seq data may have quality issues, which can significantly distort analytical results and lead to erroneous conclusions. Therefore, the raw data must be subjected to vigorous quality control (QC) procedures before downstream analysis. Currently, an accurate and complete QC of RNA-Seq data requires of a suite of different QC tools used consecutively, which is inefficient in terms of usability, running time, file usage, and interpretability of the results. Results: We developed a comprehensive, fast and easy-to-use QC pipeline for RNA-Seq data, RNA-QC-Chain, which involves three steps: (1) sequencing-quality assessment and trimming; (2) internal (ribosomal RNAs) and external (reads from foreign species) contamination filtering; (3) alignment statistics reporting (such as read number, alignment coverage, sequencing depth and pair-end read mapping information). This package was developed based on our previously reported tool for general QC of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data called QC-Chain, with extensions specifically designed for RNA-Seq data. It has several features that are not available yet in other QC tools for RNA-Seq data, such as RNA sequence trimming, automatic rRNA detection and automatic contaminating species identification. The three QC steps can run either sequentially or independently, enabling RNA-QC-Chain as a comprehensive package with high flexibility and usability. Moreover, parallel computing and optimizations are embedded in most of the QC procedures, providing a superior efficiency. The performance of RNA-QC-Chain has been evaluated with different types of datasets, including an in-house sequencing data, a semi-simulated data, and two real datasets downloaded from public database. Comparisons of RNA-QC-Chain with other QC tools have manifested its superiorities in both function versatility and processing speed. Conclusions: We present here a tool, RNA-QC-Chain, which can be used to comprehensively resolve the quality control processes of RNA-Seq data effectively and efficiently.

AB  - Sporulation of budding yeast is a developmental process in which cells undergo meiosis to generate stress-resistant progeny. The dynamic nature of the budding yeast meiotic transcriptome has been well established by a number of genome-wide studies. Here we develop an analysis pipeline to systematically identify novel transcription start sites that reside internal to a gene. Application of this pipeline to data from a synchronized meiotic time course reveals over 40 genes that display specific internal initiations in mid-sporulation. Consistent with the time of induction, motif analysis on upstream sequences of these internal transcription start sites reveals a significant enrichment for the binding site of Ndt80, the transcriptional activator of middle sporulation genes. Further examination of one gene, MRK1, demonstrates the Ndt80 binding site is necessary for internal initiation and results in the expression of an N-terminally truncated protein isoform. When the MRK1 paralog RIM11 is downregulated, the MRK1 internal transcript promotes efficient sporulation, indicating functional significance of the internal initiation. Our findings suggest internal transcriptional initiation to be a dynamic, regulated process with potential functional impacts on development.

AB  - CircRNAs exert gene regulatory effects by sequestering target microRNAs (miRNAs) and play a vital role in the onset and development of disease. Until recently, little has been known about the expression, regulation and biological function of circRNAs in both health and chronic hepatitis B (CHB).To identify hepatic circRNAs associated with CHB, we performed RNA sequencing using liver biopsies from untreated CHB patients and controls. We then established a bioinformatics pipeline for identification of CHB-associated circRNAs and in silico analysis of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA pathways. We used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to confirm these results. The profiles of hepatic circRNA expression were significantly different in CHB compared with controls, with a total of 99 dysregulated circRNAs identified to be correlated with CHB. Computational analysis of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA pathways revealed a large number of miRNAs (665), which were putatively targeted by the differentially expressed hepatic circRNAs. Interestingly, four of the predicted CHB-related circRNA-miRNA-mRNA pathways were found to be involved in the pathogenesis of HBV infection and progression of HBV-associated liver disease. Among these pathways, regression analysis of gene expression revealed a strong positive correlation between hsa_circ_0000650 and TGF2 and a negative correlation between hsa_circ_0000650 and miR-6873-3p, which hinted that hsa_circ_0000650 interacted with TGF2 mediated by miR-6873-3p. This study firstly demonstrates that patients with CHB present different profiles of hepatic circRNAs and circRNA/miRNA interactions. Thus, circRNAs have promise as novel mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and progression of CHB.

AB  - Background: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is an increasingly popular platform to study heterogeneity at the single-cell level. Computational methods to process scRNA-Seq data are not very accessible to bench scientists as they require a significant amount of bioinformatic skills. Results: We have developed Granatum, a web-based scRNA-Seq analysis pipeline to make analysis more broadly accessible to researchers. Without a single line of programming code, users can click through the pipeline, setting parameters and visualizing results via the interactive graphical interface. Granatum conveniently walks users through various steps of scRNA-Seq analysis. It has a comprehensive list of modules, including plate merging and batcheffect removal, outlier-sample removal, gene-expression normalization, imputation, gene filtering, cell clustering, differential gene expression analysis, pathway/ontology enrichment analysis, protein network interaction visualization, and pseudo-time cell series construction. Conclusions: Granatum enables broad adoption of scRNA-Seq technology by empowering bench scientists with an easy-to-use graphical interface for scRNA-Seq data analysis.

AB  - N-6-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) refers to methylation modification of the adenosine nucleotide acid at the nitrogen-6 position. Many conventional computational methods for identifying N-6-methyladenosine sites are limited by the small amount of data available. Taking advantage of the thousands of m(6)A sites detected by high-throughput sequencing, it is now possible to discover the characteristics of m(6)A sequences using deep learning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to use word embedding and deep neural networks for m(6)A prediction from mRNA sequences. Using four deep neural networks, we developed a model inferred from a larger sequence shifting window that can predict m(6)A accurately and robustly. Four prediction schemes were built with various RNA sequence representations and optimized convolutional neural networks. The soft voting results from the four deep networks were shown to outperform all of the state-of-the-art methods. We evaluated these predictors mentioned above on a rigorous independent test data set and proved that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors. The training, independent, and cross-species testing data sets are much larger than in previous studies, which could help to avoid the problem of overfitting.

AB  - The TomExpress platform was developed to provide the tomato research community with a browser and integrated web tools for public RNA-Seq data visualization and data mining. To avoid major biases that can result from the use of different mapping and statistical processing methods, RNA-Seq raw sequence data available in public databases were mapped de novo on a unique tomato reference genome sequence and post-processed using the same pipeline with accurate parameters. Following the calculation of the number of counts per gene in each RNA-Seq sample, a communal global normalization method was applied to all expression values. This unifies the whole set of expression data and makes them comparable. A database was designed where each expression value is associated with corresponding experimental annotations. Sample details were manually curated to be easily understandable by biologists. To make the data easily searchable, a user-friendly web interface was developed that provides versatile data mining web tools via on-the-fly generation of output graphics, such as expression bar plots, comprehensive in planta representations and heatmaps of hierarchically clustered expression data. In addition, it allows for the identification of co-expressed genes and the visualization of correlation networks of co-regulated gene groups. TomExpress provides one of the most complete free resources of publicly available tomato RNA-Seq data, and allows for the immediate interrogation of transcriptional programs that regulate vegetative and reproductive development in tomato under diverse conditions. The design of the pipeline developed in this project enables easy updating of the database with newly published RNA-Seq data, thereby allowing for continuous enrichment of the resource. Significance Statement After applying a bioinformatics and statistics pipeline, a unified TomExpress platform was developed to provide the tomato research community with a browser and integrated web tools for public RNA-Seq data visualization and data mining via on-the-fly generation of output graphics such as expression bar plots, comprehensive in planta representations and heatmaps of hierarchically clustered expression data. TomExpress provides one of the most complete free resources of publicly available tomato RNA-Seq data.
