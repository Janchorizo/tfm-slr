N2  - Viruses cause significant yield and quality losses in a wide variety of cultivated crops. Hence, the detection and identification of viruses is a crucial facet of successful crop production and of great significance in terms of world food security. Whilst the adoption of molecular techniques such as RT-PCR has increased the speed and accuracy of viral diagnostics, such techniques only allow the detection of known viruses, i.e., each test is specific to one or a small number of related viruses. Therefore, unknown viruses can be missed and testing can be slow and expensive if molecular tests are unavailable. Methods for simultaneous detection of multiple viruses have been developed, and (NGS) is now a principal focus of this area, as it enables unbiased and hypothesis-free testing of plant samples. The development of NGS protocols capable of detecting multiple known and emergent viruses present in infected material is proving to be a major advance for crops, nuclear stocks or imported plants and germplasm, in which disease symptoms are absent, unspecific or only triggered by multiple viruses. Researchers want to answer the question "how many different viruses are present in this crop plant?" without knowing what they are looking for: RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of plant material allows this question to be addressed. As well as needing efficient nucleic acid extraction and enrichment protocols, virus detection using RNA-seq requires fast and robust bioinformatics methods to enable host sequence removal and virus classification. In this review recent studies that use RNA-seq for virus detection in a variety of crop plants are discussed with specific emphasis on the computational methods implemented. The main features of a number of specific bioinformatics workflows developed for virus detection from NGS data are also outlined and possible reasons why these have not yet been widely adopted are discussed. The review concludes by discussing the future directions of this field, including the use of bioinformatics tools for virus detection deployed in analytical environments using cloud computing.

N2  - A major challenge in analyzing the data from high-throughput next-generation sequencing < NGS > is how to handle the huge amounts of data and variety of NGS tools and visualize the resultant outputs. To address these issues, we developed a cloud-based data analysis platform, Maser < Management and Analysis System for Enormous Reads >, and an original genome browser, Genome Explorer < GE >. Maser enables users to manage up to 2 terabytes of data to conduct analyses with easy graphical user interface operations and offers analysis pipelines in which several individual tools are combined as a single pipeline for very common and standard analyses. GE automatically visualizes genome assembly and mapping results output from Maser pipelines, without requiring additional data upload. With this function, the Maser pipelines can graphically display the results output from all the embedded tools and mapping results in a web browser. Therefore Maser realized a more user-friendly analysis platform especially for beginners by improving graphical display and providing the selected standard pipelines that work with built-in genome browser. In addition, all the analyses executed on Maser are recorded in the analysis history, helping users to trace and repeat the analyses. The entire process of analysis and its histories can be shared with collaborators or opened to the public. In conclusion, our system is useful for managing, analyzing, and visualizing NGS data and achieves traceability, reproducibility, and transparency of NGS analysis.

N2  - The current DNA sequencing technologies and their high-throughput yield, allowed the thrive of genomic and transcriptomic experiments but it also have generated big data problem. Due to this exponential growth of sequencing data, also the complexity of managing, processing and interpreting it in order to generate results, has raised. Therefore, the demand of easy-to-use friendly software and websites to run bioinformatic tools is imminent. In particular, RNA-Seq and differential expression analysis have become a popular and useful method to evaluate the genetic expression change in any organism. However, many scientists struggle with the data analysis since most of the available tools are implemented in a UNIX-based environment. Therefore, we have developed the web server IDEAMEX (Integrative Differential Expression Analysis for Multiple EXperiments). The IDEAMEX pipeline needs a raw count table for as many desired replicates and conditions, allowing the user to select which conditions will be compared, instead of doing all-vs.-all comparisons. The whole process consists of three main steps (1) Data Analysis: that allows a preliminary analysis for quality control based on the data distribution per sample, using different types of graphs; (2) Differential expression: performs the differential expression analysis with or without batch effect error awareness, using the bioconductor packages, NOISeq, limma-Voom, DESeg2 and edgeR, and generate reports for each method; (3) Result integration: the obtained results the integrated results are reported using different graphical outputs such as correlograms, heatmaps, Venn diagrams and text lists. Our server allows an easy and friendly visualization for results, providing an easy interaction during the analysis process, as well as error tracking and debugging by providing output log files. The server is currently available and can be accessed at http://www.uusmb.unam.mx/ideamex/where the documentation and example input files are provided. We consider that this web server can help other researchers with no previous bioinformatic knowledge, to perform their analyses in a simple manner.

N2  - Next-generation sequencing approaches, in particular RNA-seq, provide a genome-wide expression profiling allowing the identification of novel and rare transcripts such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA). Many RNA-seq studies have now been performed aimed at the characterization of lncRNAs and their possible involvement in cell development and differentiation in different organisms, cell types, and tissues. The adaptive immune system is an extraordinary context for the study of the role of lncRNAs in differentiation. Indeed lncRNAs seem to be key drivers in governing flexibility and plasticity of both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell, together with lineage-specific transcription factors and cytokines, acting as fine-tuners of fate choices in T cell differentiation. We describe here a pipeline for the identification of lncRNAs starting from RNA-Seq raw data.

N2  - Background: Copy number variations (CNVs) are the main genetic structural variations in cancer genome. Detecting CNVs in genetic exome region is efficient and cost-effective in identifying cancer associated genes. Many tools had been developed accordingly and yet these tools lack of reliability because of high false negative rate, which is intrinsically caused by genome exonic bias. Results: To provide an alternative option, here, we report Anaconda, a comprehensive pipeline that allows flexible integration of multiple CNV-calling methods and systematic annotation of CNVs in analyzing WES data. Just by one command, Anaconda can generate CNV detection result by up to four CNV detecting tools. Associated with comprehensive annotation analysis of genes involved in shared CNV regions, Anaconda is able to deliver a more reliable and useful report in assistance with CNV-associate cancer researches. Conclusion: Anaconda package and manual can be freely accessed at http://mcg.ustc.edu.cn/bsc/ANACONDA/. © 2017 The Author(s).

N2  - Complex behavioral traits, such as alcohol abuse, are caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors, producing deleterious functional adaptations in the central nervous system. The long-term behavioral consequences of such changes are of substantial cost to both the individual and society. Substantial progress has been made in the last two decades in understanding elements of brain mechanisms underlying responses to ethanol in animal models and risk factors for alcohol use disorder(AUD) in humans. However, treatments for AUD remain largely ineffective and few medications for this disease state have been licensed. Genome-wide genetic polymorphism analysis(GWAS) in humans, behavioral genetic studies in animal models and brain gene expression studies produced by microarrays or RNA-seq have the potential to produce nonbiased and novel insight into the underlying neurobiology of AUD. However, the complexity of such information, both statistical and informational, has slowed progress toward identifying new targets for intervention in AUD. This chapter describes one approach for integrating behavioral, genetic, and genomic information across animal model and human studies. The goal of this approach is to identify networks of genes functioning in the brain that are most relevant to the underlying mechanisms of a complex disease such as AUD. We illustrate an example of how genomic studies in animal models can be used to produce robust gene networks that have functional implications, and to integrate such animal model genomic data with human genetic studies such as GWAS for AUD. We describe several useful analysis tools for such studies: ComBAT, WGCNA, and EW_dmGWAS. The end result of this analysis is a ranking of gene networks and identification of their cognate hub genes, which might provide eventual targets for future therapeutic development. Furthermore, this combined approach may also improve our understanding of basic mechanisms underlying gene x environmental interactions affecting brain functioning in health and disease.

N2  - BackgroundHigh-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA metabarcoding) has become a routine tool for biodiversity survey and ecological studies. By including sample-specific tags in the primers prior PCR amplification, it is possible to multiplex hundreds of samples in a single sequencing run. The analysis of millions of sequences spread into hundreds to thousands of samples prompts for efficient, automated yet flexible analysis pipelines. Various algorithms and software have been developed to perform one or multiple processing steps, such as paired-end reads assembly, chimera filtering, Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) clustering and taxonomic assignment. Some of these software are now well established and widely used by scientists as part of their workflow. Wrappers that are capable to process metabarcoding data from raw sequencing data to annotated OTU-to-sample matrix were also developed to facilitate the analysis for non-specialist users. Yet, most of them require basic bioinformatic or command-line knowledge, which can limit the accessibility to such integrative toolkits. Furthermore, for flexibility reasons, these tools have adopted a step-by-step approach, which can prevent an easy automation of the workflow, and hence hamper the analysis reproducibility.ResultsWe introduce SLIM, an open-source web application that simplifies the creation and execution of metabarcoding data processing pipelines through an intuitive Graphic User Interface (GUI). The GUI interact with well-established software and their associated parameters, so that the processing steps are performed seamlessly from the raw sequencing data to an annotated OTU-to-sample matrix. Thanks to a module-centered organization, SLIM can be used for a wide range of metabarcoding cases, and can also be extended by developers for custom needs or for the integration of new software. The pipeline configuration (i.e. the modules chaining and all their parameters) is stored in a file that can be used for reproducing the same analysis.ConclusionThis web application has been designed to be user-friendly for non-specialists yet flexible with advanced settings and extensibility for advanced users and bioinformaticians. The source code along with full documentation is available on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/yoann-dufresne/SLIM) and a demonstration server is accessible through the application website (https://trtcrd.github.io/SLIM/).

N2  - As a revolutionary technology for life sciences, RNA-seq has many applications and the computation pipeline has also many variations. Here, we describe a protocol to perform RNA-seq data analysis where the aim is to identify differentially expressed genes in comparisons of two conditions. The protocol follows the recently published RNA-seq data analysis best practice and applies quality checkpoints throughout the analysis to ensure reliable data interpretation. It is written to help new RNA-seq users to understand the basic steps necessary to analyze an RNA-seq dataset properly. An extension of the protocol has been implemented as automated workflows in the R package ezRun, available also in the data analysis framework SUSHI, for reliable, repeatable, and easily interpretable analysis results.

N2  - BackgroundA statistical pipeline was developed and used for determining candidate genes and candidate gene coexpression networks involved in 2 alcohol (i.e., ethanol [EtOH]) metabolism phenotypes, namely alcohol clearance and acetate area under the curve in a recombinant inbred (RI) (HXB/BXH) rat panel. The approach was also used to provide an indication of how EtOH metabolism can impact the normal function of the identified networks. MethodsRNA was extracted from alcohol-naive liver tissue of 30 strains of HXB/BXH RI rats. The reconstructed transcripts were quantitated, and data were used to construct gene coexpression modules and networks. A separate group of rats, comprising the same 30 strains, were injected with EtOH (2g/kg) for measurement of blood EtOH and acetate levels. These data were used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of the rate of EtOH disappearance and circulating acetate levels. The analysis pipeline required calculation of the module eigengene values, the correction of these values with EtOH metabolism rates and acetate levels across the rat strains, and the determination of the eigengene QTLs. For a module to be considered a candidate for determining phenotype, the module eigengene values had to have significant correlation with the strain phenotypic values and the module eigengene QTLs had to overlap the phenotypic QTLs. ResultsOf the 658 transcript coexpression modules generated from liver RNA sequencing data, a single module satisfied all criteria for being a candidate for determining the alcohol clearance trait. This module contained 2 alcohol dehydrogenase genes, including the gene whose product was previously shown to be responsible for the majority of alcohol elimination in the rat. This module was also the only module identified as a candidate for influencing circulating acetate levels. This module was also linked to the process of generation and utilization of retinoic acid as related to the autonomous immune response. ConclusionsWe propose that our analytical pipeline can successfully identify genetic regions and transcripts which predispose a particular phenotype and our analysis provides functional context for coexpression module components.

N2  - Sequencing of total RNA enables the study of the whole plant transcriptome resulting from the simultaneous expression of the three genomes of plant cells (located in the nucleus, mitochondrion and chloroplast). While commonly used for the quantification of the nuclear gene expression, this method remains complex and challenging when applied to organellar genomes and/ or when used to quantify posttranscriptional RNA maturations. Here we propose a complete bioinformatical and statistical pipeline to fully characterize the differences in the chloroplast transcriptome between two conditions. Experimental design as well as bioinformatics and statistical analyses are described in order to quantify both gene expression and RNA posttranscriptional maturations, i.e., RNA splicing, editing, and processing, and identify statistically significant differences.

N2  - Octopus-toolkit is a stand-alone application for retrieving and processing large sets of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data with a single step. Octopus-toolkit is an automated set-up-and-analysis pipeline utilizing the Aspera, SRA Toolkit, FastQC, Trimmomatic, HISAT2, STAR, Samtools, and HOMER applications. All the applications are installed on the user's computer when the program starts. Upon the installation, it can automatically retrieve original files of various epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets, including ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, MeDIP-seq, MNase-seq and RNA-seq, from the gene expression omnibus data repository. The downloaded files can then be sequentially processed to generate BAM and BigWig files, which are used for advanced analyses and visualization. Currently, it can process NGS data from popular model genomes such as, human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), dog (Canis lupus familiaris), plant (Arabidopsis thaliana), zebrafish (Danio rerio), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), worm (Caenorhabditis elegans), and budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genomes. With the processed files from Octopus-toolkit, the meta-analysis of various data sets, motif searches for DNA-binding proteins, and the identification of differentially expressed genes and/or protein-binding sites can be easily conducted with few commands by users. Overall, Octopus-toolkit facilitates the systematic and integrative analysis of available epigenomic and transcriptomic NGS big data.

N2  - Background: Soft tissue and bone sarcoma represent a broad spectrum of different pathology and genetic variance. Current chemotherapy regimens are derived from randomised trials and represent empirical treatment. Chemosensitivity testing and whole exome sequencing (WES) may offer personalized chemotherapy treatment based on genetic mutations. Methods: A pilot, prospective, non-randomised control experimental study was conducted. Twelve patients with metastatic bone or soft tissue sarcoma that had failed first line chemotherapy treatment were enrolled for this study. Human tissue taken at surgical biopsy under general anaesthetic was divided between two arms of the trial. Subsections of the tumour were used for WES and the remainder was implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice (PDX). Results of WES were analysed using a bioinformatics pipeline to identify mutations conferring susceptibility to kinase inhibitors and common chemotherapeutic agents. PDX models exhibiting successful growth underwent WES of the tumour and subsequent chemosensitivity testing. Results: WES was successful in all 12 patients, with successful establishment PDX tumours models in seven patients. WES identified potential actionable therapeutics in all patients. Significant variation in predicted therapeutics was demonstrated between three PDX samples and their matched tumour samples. Conclusion: Analysis of WES of fresh tumour specimens via a bioinformatics pipeline may identify potential actionable chemotherapy agents. Further research into this field may lead to the development of personalized cancer therapy for sarcoma.

N2  - Background: Gene prediction is one of the most important steps in the genome annotation process. A large number of software tools and pipelines developed by various computing techniques are available for gene prediction. However, these systems have yet to accurately predict all or even most of the protein-coding regions. Furthermore, none of the currently available gene-finders has a universal Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that can perform gene prediction for all organisms equally well in an automatic fashion. Results: We present an automated gene prediction pipeline, Seqping that uses self-training HMM models and transcriptomic data. The pipeline processes the genome and transcriptome sequences of the target species using GlimmerHMM, SNAP, and AUGUSTUS pipelines, followed by MAKER2 program to combine predictions from the three tools in association with the transcriptomic evidence. Seqping generates species-specific HMMs that are able to offer unbiased gene predictions. The pipeline was evaluated using the Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana genomes. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis showed that the pipeline was able to identify at least 95% of BUSCO's plantae dataset. Our evaluation shows that Seqping was able to generate better gene predictions compared to three HMM-based programs (MAKER2, GlimmerHMM and AUGUSTUS) using their respective available HMMs. Seqping had the highest accuracy in rice (0.5648 for CDS, 0.4468 for exon, and 0.6695 nucleotide structure) and A. thaliana (0.5808 for CDS, 0.5955 for exon, and 0.8839 nucleotide structure). Conclusions: Seqping provides researchers a seamless pipeline to train species-specific HMMs and predict genes in newly sequenced or less-studied genomes. We conclude that the Seqping pipeline predictions are more accurate than gene predictions using the other three approaches with the default or available HMMs.

N2  - Identification of viral integration sites has been important in understanding the pathogenesis and progression of diseases associated with particular viral infections. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled researchers to understand the impact that viral integration has on the host, such as tumorigenesis. Current computational methods to analyze NGS data of virus-host junction sites have been limited in terms of their accessibility to a broad user base. In this study, we developed a software application (named ChimericSeq), that is the first program of its kind to offer a graphical user interface, compatibility with both Windows and Mac operating systems, and optimized for effectively identifying and annotating virus-host chimeric reads within NGS data. In addition, ChimericSeq's pipeline implements custom filtering to remove artifacts and detect reads with quantitative analytical reporting to provide functional significance to discovered integration sites. The improved accessibility of ChimericSeq through a GUI interface in both Windows and Mac has potential to expand NGS analytical support to a broader spectrum of the scientific community.

N2  - Background: Genome-wide miRNA expression data can be used to study miRNA dysregulation comprehensively. Although many open-source tools for microRNA (miRNA)-seq data analyses are available, challenges remain in accurate miRNA quantification from large-scale miRNA-seq dataset. We implemented a pipeline called QuickMIRSeq for accurate quantification of known miRNAs and miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) from multiple samples simultaneously. Results: QuickMIRSeq considers the unique nature of miRNAs and combines many important features into its implementation. First, it takes advantage of high redundancy of miRNA reads and introduces joint mapping of multiple samples to reduce computational time. Second, it incorporates the strand information in the alignment step for more accurate quantification. Third, reads potentially arising from background noise are filtered out to improve the reliability of miRNA detection. Fourth, sequences aligned to miRNAs with mismatches are remapped to a reference genome to further reduce false positives. Finally, QuickMIRSeq generates a rich set of QC metrics and publication-ready plots. Conclusions: The rich visualization features implemented allow end users to interactively explore the results and gain more insights into miRNA-seq data analyses. The high degree of automation and interactivity in QuickMIRSeq leads to a substantial reduction in the time and effort required for miRNA-seq data analysis.

N2  - Understanding the role of short-interfering RNA (siRNA) in diverse biological processes is of current interest and often approached through small RNA sequencing. However, analysis of these datasets is difficult due to the complexity of biological RNA processing pathways, which differ between species. Several properties like strand specificity, length distribution, and distribution of soft-dipped bases are few parameters known to guide researchers in understanding the role of siRNAs. We present RAPID, a generic eukaryotic siRNA analysis pipeline, which captures information inherent in the datasets and automatically produces numerous visualizations as user-friendly HTML reports, covering multiple categories required for siRNA analysis. RAPID also facilitates an automated comparison of multiple datasets, with one of the normalization techniques dedicated for siRNA knockdown analysis, and integrates differential expression analysis using DESeq2.

N2  - An estimated 17% of cancers worldwide are associated with infectious causes. The extent and biological significance of viral presence/infection in actual tumor samples is generally unknown but could be measured using human transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from tumor samples. We present an open source bioinformatics pipeline viGEN, which allows for not only the detection and quantification of viral RNA, but also variants in the viral transcripts. The pipeline includes 4 major modules: The first module aligns and filter out human RNA sequences; the second module maps and count (remaining un-aligned) reads against reference genomes of all known and sequenced human viruses; the third module quantifies read counts at the individual viral-gene level thus allowing for downstream differential expression analysis of viral genes between case and controls groups. The fourth module calls variants in these viruses. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available pipelines or packages that would provide this type of complete analysis in one open source package. In this paper, we applied the viGEN pipeline to two case studies. We first demonstrate the working of our pipeline on a large public dataset, the TOGA cervical cancer cohort. In the second case study, we performed an in-depth analysis on a small focused study of TOGA liver cancer patients. In the latter cohort, we performed viral-gene quantification, viral-variant extraction and survival analysis. This allowed us to find differentially expressed viral-transcripts and viral-variants between the groups of patients, and connect them to clinical outcome. From our analyses, we show that we were able to successfully detect the human papilloma virus among the TOGA cervical cancer patients. We compared the viGEN pipeline with two metagenomics tools and demonstrate similar sensitivity/specificity. We were also able to quantify viral-transcripts and extract viral-variants using the liver cancer dataset. The results presented corresponded with published literature in terms of rate of detection, and impact of several known variants of HBV genome. This pipeline is generalizable, and can be used to provide novel biological insights into microbial infections in complex diseases and tumorigeneses. Our viral pipeline could be used in conjunction with additional type of immuno-oncology analysis based on RNA-seq data of host RNA for cancer immunology applications.

N2  - Next-generation sequencing is empowering genetic disease research. However, it also brings significant challenges for efficient and effective sequencing data analysis. We built a pipeline, called DNAp, for analyzing whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, to detect mutations from disease samples. The pipeline is containerized, convenient to use and can run under any system, since it is a fully automatic process in Docker container form. It is also open, and can be easily customized with user intervention points, such as for updating reference files and different software or versions. The pipeline has been tested with both human and mouse sequencing datasets, and it has generated mutations results, comparable to published results from these datasets, and reproducible across heterogeneous hardware platforms. The pipeline DNAp, funded by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was developed for analyzing DNA sequencing data of FDA. Here we make DNAp an open source, with the software and documentation available to the public at http://bioinformatics.astate.edu/dna-pipeline/.

N2  - Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences which are capable of moving from one location to another and represent a large proportion (45%) of the human genome. TEs have functional roles in a variety of biological phenomena such as cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and aging. Rapid development in RNA-sequencing technology has enabled us, for the first time, to study the activity of TE at the systems level. However, efficient TE analysis tools are not yet developed. In this work, we developed SalmonTE, a fast and reliable pipeline for the quantification of TEs from RNA-seq data. We benchmarked our tool against TEtranscripts, a widely used TE quantification method, and three other quantification methods using several RNA-seq datasets from Drosophila melanogaster and human cell-line. We achieved 20 times faster execution speed without compromising the accuracy. This pipeline will enable the biomedical research community to quantify and analyze TEs from large amounts of data and lead to novel TE centric discoveries.

N2  - Since its first use in plants in 2007, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has generated a vast amount of data for both model and nonmodel species. Organellar transcriptomes, however, are virtually always overlooked at the data analysis step. We therefore developed ChloroSeq, a bioinformatic pipeline aimed at facilitating the systematic analysis of chloroplast RNA metabolism, and we provide here a step-by--step user's manual. Following the alignment of quality-controlled data to the genome of interest, ChloroSeq measures genome expression level along with splicing and RNA editing efficiencies. When used in combination with the Tuxedo suite (TopHat and Cufflinks), ChloroSeq allows the simultaneous analysis of organellar and nuclear transcriptomes, opening the way to a better understanding of nucleus-organelle cross talk. We also describe the use of R commands to produce publication-quality figures based on ChloroSeq outputs. The effectiveness of the pipeline is illustrated through analysis of an RNA-Seq dataset covering the transition from growth to maturation to senescence of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves.

N2  - Advancing the clinical utility of whole-exome sequencing (WES) for patients with suspected genetic disorders is largely driven by bioinformatics approaches that streamline data processing and analysis. Herein, we describe our experience with implementing a semiautomated and phenotype-driven WES diagnostic workflow, incorporating both the DRAGEN pipeline and the Exomiser variant prioritization tool, at an academic children's hospital with an ethnically diverse pediatric patient population. We achieved a 41% molecular diagnostic rate for 66 duo-, quad-, or trio-WES cases, and 28% for 40 singleton-WES cases. Preliminary results were returned to ordering physicians within 1 wk for 12 of 38 (32%) probands with positive findings, which were instrumental in guiding the appropriate clinical management for a variety of patients, especially in critical care settings. The semiautomated and streamlined WES workflow also enabled us to identify novel variants in candidate disease genes in patients with developmental delay and autism and immune disorders and cancer, including ANK2, BPTF, BCL11A, FOXN1, PLAA, ATRX, DNAJC21, and RAD50. Together, we demonstrated the implementation of a streamlined WES workflow that was successfully applied for both clinical and research purposes.

N2  - Proper control of microRNA (miRNA) expression is critical for normal development and physiology, while abnormal miRNA expression is a common feature of many diseases. Dissecting mechanisms of miRNA regulation, however, is complicated by the generally poor annotation of miRNA primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). Although some miRNAs are processed from well-defined protein coding genes, the majority of pri-miRNAs are poorly characterized noncoding RNAs, with incomplete annotation of promoters, splice sites, and polyadenylation signals. Due to the efficiency of DROSHA processing, the abundance of pri-miRNAs is very low at steady state, thereby complicating the elucidation of pri-miRNA structures. Here we describe a strategy to enrich intact pri-miRNAs and improve their coverage in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments. In addition, we outline a computational approach for reconstruction of pri-miRNA structures. This pipeline begins with raw RNA-seq reads and concludes with publication-ready visualization of pri-miRNA annotations. Together, these approaches allow the user to define and explore miRNA gene structures in a cell-type or organism of interest.

N2  - Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a well-known small RNA (sRNA) species with important regulatory roles. To date, several bioinformatics tools have been developed for large-scale prediction of miRNAs based on high-throughput sequencing data. However, some of these tools become invalid without reference genomes, while some tools cannot supply user-friendly outputs. Besides, most of the current tools focus on the importance of secondary structures and sRNA expression patterns for miRNA prediction, while they do not pay attention to miRNA processing for reliability check. Results: Here, we reported a pipeline PmiRDiscVali for plant miRNA discovery and partial validation. This pipeline integrated the popular tool miRDeep-P for plant miRNA prediction, making PmiRDiscVali compatible for both reference-based and de novo predictions. To check the prediction reliability, we adopted the concept that the miRNA processing intermediates could be tracked by degradome sequencing (degradome-seq) during the development of PmiRDiscVali. A case study was performed by using the public sequencing data of Dendrobium officinale, in order to show the clear and concise presentation of the prediction results. Conclusion: Summarily, the integrated pipeline PmiRDiscVali, featured with degradome-seq data-based validation and vivid result presentation, should be useful for large-scale identification of plant miRNA candidates.

N2  - Next generation sequencing of the RNA content of single cells or single nuclei (sc/nRNA-seq) has become a powerful approach to understand the cellular complexity and diversity of multicellular organisms and environmental ecosystems. However, the fact that the procedure begins with a relatively small amount of starting material, thereby pushing the limits of the laboratory procedures required, dictates that careful approaches for sample quality control (QC) are essential to reduce the impact of technical noise and sample bias in downstream analysis applications. Here we present a preliminary framework for sample level quality control that is based on the collection of a series of quantitative laboratory and data metrics that are used as features for the construction of QC classification models using random forest machine learning approaches. We've applied this initial framework to a dataset comprised of 2272 single nuclei RNA-seq results and determined that similar to 79% of samples were of high quality. Removal of the poor quality samples from downstream analysis was found to improve the cell type clustering results. In addition, this approach identified quantitative features related to the proportion of unique or duplicate reads and the proportion of reads remaining after quality trimming as useful features for pass/fail classification. The construction and use of classification models for the identification of poor quality samples provides for an objective and scalable approach to sc/nRNA-seq quality control.

N2  - Plant transcription factors have potential to behave as hubs in gene regulatory networks through altering the expression of many downstream genes, and identification of such hub transcription factors strongly enhances our understating of biological processes. Transcriptome analysis has become a staple of gene expression analyses. In addition to current advances in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, various methods for mRNA library construction and downstream data analyses have been enthusiastically developed. Here, we describe Breath Adapter Directional sequencing (BrAD-seq), a simple strand-specific mRNA library preparation for the Illumina platform, allowing easy scaling of transcriptome experiments with low reagent and labor costs. This protocol includes our recent modifications and the detailed practical procedure for BrAD-seq. Because extracting biological meanings from large-scale transcriptome data presents a significant challenge, we also describe a new analytical method that goes beyond differential expression. Differential regulatory analysis (DRA) is based on a gene co-expression network to address which regulatory factor or factors have the ability to predict the abundance of differentially expressed genes between two groups or conditions. This protocol provides a ready-to-use informatics pipeline from raw sequence data to DRA for plant transcriptome datasets.

N2  - The improvement of sequencing technologies has facilitated generalization of metagenomic sequencing, which has become a standard procedure for analyzing the structure and functionality of microbiomes. Bioinformatic analysis of sequencing results poses a challenge because it involves many different complex steps. SqueezeMeta is a fully automatic pipeline for metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, covering all steps of the analysis. SqueezeMeta includes multi-metagenome support that enables co-assembly of related metagenomes and retrieval of individual genomes via binning procedures. SqueezeMeta features several unique characteristics: co-assembly procedure or coassembly of unlimited number of metagenomes via merging of individual assembled metagenomes, both with read mapping for estimation of the abundances of genes in each metagenome. It also includes binning and bin checking for retrieving individual genomes. Internal checks for the assembly and binning steps provide information about the consistency of contigs and bins. Moreover, results are stored in a MySQL database, where they can be easily exported and shared, and can be inspected anywhere using a flexible web interface that allows simple creation of complex queries. We illustrate the potential of SqueezeMeta by analyzing 32 gut metagenomes in a fully automatic way, enabling retrieval of several million genes and several hundreds of genomic bins. One of the motivations in the development of SqueezeMeta was producing a software capable of running in small desktop computers and thus amenable to all users and settings. We were also able to co-assemble two of these metagenomes and complete the full analysis in less than one day using a simple laptop computer. This reveals the capacity of SqueezeMeta to run without high-performance computing infrastructure and in absence of any network connectivity. It is therefore adequate for in situ, real time analysis of metagenomes produced by nanopore sequencing. SqueezeMeta can be downloaded from https://github.com/jtamames/SqueezeMeta.

N2  - Background: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments typically analyze hundreds or thousands of cells after amplification of the cDNA. The high throughput is made possible by the early introduction of sample-specific bar codes (BCs), and the amplification bias is alleviated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Thus, the ideal analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data needs to efficiently tabulate reads according to both BC and UMI. Findings: zUMIs is a pipeline that can handle both known and random BCs and also efficiently collapse UMIs, either just for exon mapping reads or for both exon and intron mapping reads. If BC annotation is missing, zUMIs can accurately detect intact cells from the distribution of sequencing reads. Another unique feature of zUMIs is the adaptive downsampling function that facilitates dealing with hugely varying library sizes but also allows the user to evaluate whether the library has been sequenced to saturation. To illustrate the utility of zUMIs, we analyzed a single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset and show that more than 35% of all reads map to introns. Also, we show that these intronic reads are informative about expression levels, significantly increasing the number of detected genes and improving the cluster resolution. Conclusions: zUMIs flexibility makes if possible to accommodate data generated with any of the major scRNA-seq protocols that use BCs and UMIs and is the most feature-rich, fast, and user-friendly pipeline to process such scRNA-seq data.

N2  - The recent availability of comprehensive, brain-wide gene expression atlases such as the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) has opened new opportunities for understanding how spatial variations on molecular scale relate to the macroscopic neuroimaging phenotypes. A rapidly growing body of literature is demonstrating relationships between gene expression and diverse properties of brain structure and function, but approaches for combining expression atlas data with neuroimaging are highly inconsistent, with substantial variations in how the expression data are processed. The degree to which these methodological variations affect findings is unclear. Here, we outline a seven-step analysis pipeline for relating brain-wide transcriptomic and neuroimaging data and compare how different processing choices influence the resulting data. We suggest that studies using the AHBA should work towards a unified data processing pipeline to ensure consistent and reproducible results in this burgeoning field.

N2  - Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming a standard experimental methodology for genome-wide characterization and quantification of transcripts at single base-pair resolution. However, downstream analysis of massive amount of sequencing data can be prohibitively technical for wet-lab researchers. A functionally integrated and user-friendly platform is required to meet this demand. Here, we present iSeq, an R-based Web server, for RNA-seq data analysis and visualization. iSeq is a streamlined Web-based R application under the Shiny framework, featuring a simple user interface and multiple data analysis modules. Users without programming and statistical skills can analyze their RNA-seq data and construct publication-level graphs through a standardized yet customizable analytical pipeline. iSeq is accessible via Web browsers on any operating system at http://iseq.cbi.pku.edu.cn.

N2  - With advances in molecular biology, various biological phenomena can now be explored at higher resolution using mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), two powerful high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. While methods are used widely in mouse, human, etc., less information is available in other animals, such as the chicken. Here we assemble a workflow of the RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analyses for the chicken studies using chicken skin appendage tissue as an example. We present guidelines for RNA-Seq quality control, alignment, quantification, normalization, and differentially expressed gene analysis. In the meantime, we outline a bioinformatics pipeline for ChIP-Seq quality control, alignment, peak calling, super-enhancer identification, and differential enrichment analysis.

N2  - Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed male cancer in the world. The molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression are still unclear. Here we show analysis of a prostate cancer RNA-sequencing dataset that was originally generated by Ren et al. [3] from the prostate tumor and adjacent normal tissues of 14 patients. The data presented here was analyzed using our RNA-sequencing bioinformatics analysis pipeline implemented on the bioinformatics web platform, Galaxy. The relative expression of fibronectin (FN1) and the androgen receptor (AR) were calculated in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads, and represented in FPKM unit. A subanalysis is also shown for data from three patients, that includes the relative expression of FN1 and AR and their fold change. For interpretation and discussion, please refer to the article, "miR-1207-3p regulates the androgen receptor in prostate cancer via FNDC1/fibronectin" [1] by Das et al. (C) 2017 The Authors.

N2  - The advent of next-generation sequencing has resulted in transcriptome-based approaches to investigate functionally significant biological components in a variety of non-model organism. This has resulted in the area of "venomics": a rapidly growing field using combined transcriptomic and proteomic datasets to characterize toxin diversity in a variety of venomous taxa. Ultimately, the transcriptomic portion of these analyses follows very similar pathways after transcriptome assembly often including candidate toxin identification using BLAST, expression level screening, protein sequence alignment, gene tree reconstruction, and characterization of potential toxin function. Here we describe the Python package Venomix, which streamlines these processes using common bioinformatic tools along with ToxProt, a publicly available annotated database comprised of characterized venom proteins. In this study, we use the Venomix pipeline to characterize candidate venom diversity in four phylogenetically distinct organisms, a cone snail (Conidae; Conus sponsalis), a snake (Viperidae; Echis coloratus), an ant (Formicidae; Tetramorium bicarinatum), and a scorpion (Scorpionidae; Urodacus yaschenkoi). Data on these organisms were sampled from public databases, with each original analysis using different approaches for transcriptome assembly, toxin identification, or gene expression quantification, Venomix recovered numerically more candidate toxin transcripts for three of the four transcriptomes than the original analyses and identified new toxin candidates. In summary, we show that the Venomix package is a useful tool to identify and characterize the diversity of toxin-like transcripts derived from transcriptomic datasets.

N2  - Sequencing of transcribed RNA molecules (RNA-Seq) has been used wildly for studying cell transcriptomes in bulk or at the single-cell level (Wang et al., Nat Rev Genet, 10:57-63, 2009; Ozsolak and Milos, Nat Rev Genet, 12:87-98, 2011; Sandberg, Nat Methods, 11:22-24, 2014) and is becoming the de facto technology for investigating gene expression level changes in various biological conditions, on the time course, and under drug treatments. Furthermore, RNA-Seq data helped identify fusion genes that are related to certain cancers (Maher et al., Nature, 458:97-101, 2009). Differential gene expression before and after drug treatments provides insights to mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics of the drugs, and safety concerns (Dixit et al., Genomics, 107:178-188, 2016). Because each RNA-Seq run generates tens to hundreds of millions of short reads with size ranging from 50 to 200 bp, a tool that deciphers these short reads to an integrated and digestible analysis report is in high demand. QuickRNASeq (Zhao et al., BMC Genomics, 17:39-53, 2016) is an application for large-scale RNA-Seq data analysis and real-time interactive visualization of complex data sets. This application automates the use of several of the best open-source tools to efficiently generate user friendly, easy to share, and ready to publish report. Figures in this protocol illustrate some of the interactive plots produced by QuickRNASeq. The visualization features of the application have been further improved since its first publication in early 2016. The original QuickRNASeq publication (Zhao et al., BMC Genomics, 17:39-53, 2016) provided details of background, software selection, and implementation. Here, we outline the steps required to implement QuickRNASeq in user's own environment, as well as demonstrate some basic yet powerful utilities of the advanced interactive visualization modules in the report.

N2  - RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) function in all aspects of RNA processes including stability, structure, export, localization and translation, and control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. To investigate the roles of RBPs and their direct RNA ligands in vivo, recent global approaches combining RNA immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (RIP-seq) as well as UV-cross-linking (CLIP-seq) have become instrumental in dissecting RNA-protein interactions. However, the computational analysis of these high-throughput sequencing data is still challenging. Here, we provide a computational pipeline to analyze CLIP-seq and RIP-seq datasets. This generic analytic procedure may help accelerate the identification of direct RNA-protein interactions from high-throughput RBP profiling experiments in a variety of bacterial species.

N2  - RNA-based regulation has become a major research topic inmolecular biology. The analysis of epigenetic and expression data is therefore incomplete if RNA-based regulation is not taken into account. Thus, it is increasingly important but not yet standard to combine RNA-centric data and analysis tools with other types of experimental data such as RNA-seq or ChIP-seq. Here, we present the RNA workbench, a comprehensive set of analysis tools and consolidated workflows that enable the researcher to combine these two worlds. Based on the Galaxy framework the workbench guarantees simple access, easy extension, flexible adaption to personal and security needs, and sophisticated analyses that are independent of command-line knowledge. Currently, it includes more than 50 bioinformatics tools that are dedicated to different research areas of RNA biology including RNA structure analysis, RNA alignment, RNA annotation, RNA-protein interaction, ribosome profiling, RNA-seq analysis and RNA target prediction. The workbench is developed and maintained by experts in RNA bioinformatics and the Galaxy framework. Together with the growing community evolving around this workbench, we are committed to keep the workbench up-to-date for future standards and needs, providing researchers with a reliable and robust framework for RNA data analysis. Availability: The RNA workbench is available at https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench.

N2  - Motivation: Next-generation sequencing is now an established method in genomics, and massive amounts of sequencing data are being generated on a regular basis. Analysis of the sequencing data is typically performed by lab-specific in-house solutions, but the agreement of results from different facilities is often small. General standards for quality control, reproducibility and documentation are missing. Results: We developed NGS-pipe, a flexible, transparent and easy-to-use framework for the design of pipelines to analyze whole-exome, whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing data. NGSpipe facilitates the harmonization of genomic data analysis by supporting quality control, documentation, reproducibility, parallelization and easy adaptation to other NGS experiments.

N2  - An increasing number of single cell transcriptome and epigenome technologies, including single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq), have been recently developed as powerful tools to analyze the features of many individual cells simultaneously. However, the methods and software were designed for one certain data type and only for single cell transcriptome data. A systematic approach for epigenome data and multiple types of transcriptome data is needed to control data quality and to perform cell-to-cell heterogeneity analysis on these ultra-high-dimensional transcriptome and epigenome datasets. Here we developed Dr. seq2, a Quality Control (QC) and analysis pipeline for multiple types of single cell transcriptome and epigenome data, including scATAC-seq and Drop-ChIP data. Application of this pipeline provides four groups of QC measurements and different analyses, including cell heterogeneity analysis. Dr. seq2 produced reliable results on published single cell transcriptome and epigenome datasets. Overall, Dr. seq2 is a systematic and comprehensive QC and analysis pipeline designed for parallel single cell transcriptome and epigenome data.

N2  - High-throughput next-generation sequencing is a powerful tool to identify the genotypic landscapes of somatic variants and therapeutic targets in various cancers including gastric cancer, forming the basis for personalized medicine in the clinical setting. Although the advent of many computational algorithms leads to higher accuracy in somatic variant calling, no standard method exists due to the limitations of each method. Here, we constructed a new pipeline. We combined two different somatic variant callers with different algorithms, Strelka and VarScan 2, and evaluated performance using whole exome sequencing data obtained from 19 Japanese cases with gastric cancer (GC); then, we characterized these tumors based on identified driver molecular alterations. More single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions were detected by Strelka and VarScan 2, respectively. SNVs detected by both tools showed higher accuracy for estimating somatic variants compared with those detected by only one of the two tools and accurately showed the mutation signature and mutations of driver genes reported for GC. Our combinatorial pipeline may have an advantage in detection of somatic mutations in GC and may be useful for further genomic characterization of Japanese patients with GC to improve the efficacy of GC treatments. © 2017, University of Tokushima.

N2  - Rapid advancements in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, coupled with the dramatic decrease in cost, have made NGS one of the leading approaches applied in cancer research. In addition, it is increasingly used in clinical practice for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Somatic (cancer-only) single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions (indels) are the simplest classes of mutation, however, their identifcation in whole exome sequencing data is complicated by germline polymorphisms, tumor heterogeneity and errors in sequencing and analysis. An increasing number of software and methodological guidelines are being published for the analysis of sequencing data. Usually, the algorithms of MuTect, VarScan and Genome Analysis Toolkit are applied to identify the variants. However, one of these algorithms alone results in incomplete genomic information. To address this issue, the present study developed a systematic pipeline for analyzing the whole exome sequencing data of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a combination of the three algorithms, named the three-caller pipeline. Application of the three-caller pipeline to the whole exome data of HCC, improved the detection of true positive mutations and a total of 75 tumor-specifc somatic variants were identifed. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the mutations in the genes encoding cell adhesion and regulation of Ras GTPase activity. This pipeline provides an effective approach to identify variants from NGS data for subsequent functional analyses.

N2  - Intermolecular interactions of ncRNAs are at the core of gene regulation events, and identifying the full map of these interactions bears crucial importance for ncRNA functional studies. It is known that RNA- RNA interactions are built up by complementary base pairings between interacting RNAs and high level of complementarity between two RNA sequences is a powerful predictor of such interactions. Here, we present RIsearch2, a large-scale RNA-RNA interaction prediction tool that enables quick localization of potential near-complementary RNA-RNA interactions between given query and target sequences. In contrast to previous heuristics which either search for exact matches while including G-U wobble pairs or employ simplified energy models, we present a novel approach using a single integrated seed-andextend framework based on suffix arrays. RIsearch2 enables fast discovery of candidate RNA-RNA interactions on genome/transcriptome-wide scale. We furthermore present an siRNA off-target discovery pipeline that not only predicts the off-target transcripts but also computes the off-targeting potential of a given siRNA. This is achieved by combining genome-wide RIsearch2 predictions with target site accessibilities and transcript abundance estimates. We show that this pipeline accurately predicts siRNA off-target interactions and enables offtargeting potential comparisons between different siRNA designs. RIsearch2 and the siRNA off-target discovery pipeline are available as stand-alone software packages from http://rth.dk/resources/risearch. © The Author(s) 2017.

Sequence data are generated by DOE's Joint Genome Institute (JGI), submitted by individual scientists, or collected from public sequence data archives. Structural and functional annotation is carried out by JGI's genome and metagenome annotation pipelines. A variety of analytical and visualization tools provide support for examining and comparing IMG/M's datasets. IMG/M allows open access interactive analysis of publicly available datasets, while manual curation, submission and access to private datasets and computationally intensive workspace-based analysis require login/password access to its expert review(ER) companion system (IMG/M ER: https://img.jgi.doe.gov/ mer/). Since the last report published in the 2014 NAR Database Issue, IMG/M's dataset content has tripled in terms of number of datasets and overall protein coding genes, while its analysis tools have been extended to cope with the rapid growth in the number and size of datasets handled by the system. © The Author(s) 2016.

N2  - The interest in investigating the biological roles of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) is increasing, due to the pleiotropic effects of these molecules exert in many biological contexts. While several methods and tools are available to study microRNAs (miRNAs), only few focus on novel classes of sncRNAs, in particular PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). To overcome these limitations, we implemented iSmaRT (integrative Small RNA Tool-kit), an automated pipeline to analyze smallRNA-Seq data. © The Author 2016.

N2  - The recently introduced Kallisto pseudoaligner has radically simplified the quantification of transcripts in RNA-sequencing experiments. We offer cloud-scale RNAseq pipelines Arkas-Quantification, which deploys Kallisto for parallel cloud computations, and Arkas-Analysis, which annotates the Kallisto results by extracting structured information directly from source FASTA files with per-contig metadata and calculates the differential expression and gene-set enrichment analysis on both coding genes and transcripts. The biologically informative downstream gene-set analysis maintains special focus on Reactome annotations while supporting ENSEMBL transcriptomes. The Arkas cloud quantification pipeline includes support for custom user-uploaded FASTA files, selection for bias correction and pseudoBAM output. The option to retain pseudoBAM output for structural variant detection and annotation provides a middle ground between de novo transcriptome assembly and routine quantification, while consuming a fraction of the resources used by popular fusion detection pipelines. Illumina's BaseSpace cloud computing environment, where these two applications are hosted, offers a massively parallel distributive quantification step for users where investigators are better served by cloud-based computing platforms due to inherent efficiencies of scale. © 2017 Colombo AR et al.

N2  - Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a very valuable resource to understand the evolutionary history of poorly known species. However, in organisms with large genomes, as most amphibians, WGS is still excessively challenging and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) represents a cost-effective tool to explore genome-wide variability. Nonmodel organisms do not usually have a reference genome and the transcriptome must be assembled de-novo. We used RNA-seq to obtain the transcriptomic profile for Oreobates cruralis, a poorly known South American direct-developing frog. In total, 550,871 transcripts were assembled, corresponding to 422,999 putative genes. Of those, we identified 23,500, 37,349, 38,120 and 45,885 genes present in the Pfam, EggNOG, KEGG and GO databases, respectively. Interestingly, our results suggested that genes related to immune system and defense mechanisms are abundant in the transcriptome of O. cruralis. We also present a pipeline to assist with pre-processing, assembling, evaluating and functionally annotating a de-novo transcriptome from RNA-seq data of non-model organisms. Our pipeline guides the inexperienced user in an intuitive way through all the necessary steps to build de-novo transcriptome assemblies using readily available software and is freely available at: https://github.com/biomendi/TRANSCRIPTOME-ASSEMBLY-PIPELINE/wiki. © 2017 Montero-Mendieta et al.

N2  - Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used in a range of biomedical studies. Nonetheless, current RNA-seq analysis tools are not specifically designed to efficiently process scRNA-seq data due to their limited scalability. Here we introduce Falco, a cloud-based framework to enable paralellization of existing RNA-seq processing pipelines using big data technologies of Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark for performing massively parallel analysis of large scale transcriptomic data. Using two public scRNA-seq datasets and two popular RNA-seq alignment/feature quantification pipelines, we show that the same processing pipeline runs 2.6-145.4 times faster using Falco than running on a highly optimized standalone computer. Falco also allows users to utilize low-cost spot instances of Amazon Web Services, providing a ∼65% reduction in cost of analysis. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.

N2  - Background: The identification of disease-causing variants in autosomal dominant diseases using exome-sequencing data remains a difficult task in small pedigrees. We combined several strategies to improve filtering and prioritizing of heterozygous variants using exome-sequencing datasets in familial Meniere disease: an in-house Pathogenic Variant (PAVAR) score, the Variant Annotation Analysis and Search Tool (VAAST-Phevor), Exomiser-v2, CADD, and FATHMM. We also validated the method by a benchmarking procedure including causal mutations in synthetic exome datasets. Results: PAVAR and VAAST were able to select the same sets of candidate variants independently of the studied disease. In contrast, Exomiser V2 and VAAST-Phevor had a variable correlation depending on the phenotypic information available for the disease on each family. Nevertheless, all the selected diseases ranked a limited number of concordant variants in the top 10 ranking, using the three systems or other combined algorithm such as CADD or FATHMM. Benchmarking analyses confirmed that the combination of systems with different approaches improves the prediction of candidate variants compared with the use of a single method. The overall efficiency of combined tools ranges between 68 and 71% in the top 10 ranked variants. Conclusions: Our pipeline prioritizes a short list of heterozygous variants in exome datasets based on the top 10 concordant variants combining multiple systems. © The Author(s). 2017.

N2  - Background: The 15 sibling species of the Paramecium aurelia cryptic species complex emerged after a whole genome duplication that occurred tens of millions of years ago. Given extensive knowledge of the genetics and epigenetics of Paramecium acquired over the last century, this species complex offers a uniquely powerful system to investigate the consequences of whole genome duplication in a unicellular eukaryote as well as the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that drive speciation. High quality Paramecium gene models are important for research using this system. The major aim of the work reported here was to build an improved gene annotation pipeline for the Paramecium lineage. Results: We generated oriented RNA-Seq transcriptome data across the sexual process of autogamy for the model species Paramecium tetraurelia. We determined, for the first time in a ciliate, candidate P. tetraurelia transcription start sites using an adapted Cap-Seq protocol. We developed TrUC, multi-threaded Perl software that in conjunction with TopHat mapping of RNA-Seq data to a reference genome, predicts transcription units for the annotation pipeline. We used EuGene software to combine annotation evidence. The high quality gene structural annotations obtained for P. tetraurelia were used as evidence to improve published annotations for 3 other Paramecium species. The RNA-Seq data were also used for differential gene expression analysis, providing a gene expression atlas that is more sensitive than the previously established microarray resource. Conclusions: We have developed a gene annotation pipeline tailored for the compact genomes and tiny introns of Paramecium species. A novel component of this pipeline, TrUC, predicts transcription units using Cap-Seq and oriented RNA-Seq data. TrUC could prove useful beyond Paramecium, especially in the case of high gene density. Accurate predictions of 3' and 5' UTR will be particularly valuable for studies of gene expression (e.g. nucleosome positioning, identification of cis regulatory motifs). The P. tetraurelia improved transcriptome resource, gene annotations for P. tetraurelia, P. biaurelia, P. sexaurelia and P. caudatum, and Paramecium-trained EuGene configuration are available through ParameciumDB ( http://paramecium.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr ).

N2  - Processing of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data requires significant technical skills, involving installation, configuration, and execution of bioinformatics data pipelines, in addition to specialized postanalysis visualization and data mining software. In order to address some of these challenges, developers have leveraged virtualization containers toward seamless deployment of preconfigured bioinformatics software and pipelines on any computational platform. We present an approach for abstracting the complex data operations of multistep, bioinformatics pipelines for NGS data analysis. As examples, we have deployed 2 pipelines for RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, preconfigured within Docker virtualization containers we call Bio-Docklets. Each Bio-Docklet exposes a single data input and output endpoint and from a user perspective, running the pipelines as simply as running a single bioinformatics tool. This is achieved using a "meta-script" that automatically starts the Bio-Docklets and controls the pipeline execution through the BioBlend software library and the Galaxy Application Programming Interface. The pipeline output is postprocessed by integration with the Visual Omics Explorer framework, providing interactive data visualizations that users can access through a web browser. Our goal is to enable easy access to NGS data analysis pipelines for nonbioinformatics experts on any computing environment, whether a laboratory workstation, university computer cluster, or a cloud service provider. Beyond end users, the Bio-Docklets also enables developers to programmatically deploy and run a large number of pipeline instances for concurrent analysis of multiple datasets. © The Author 2017.

N2  - Background: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are commonly used to identify key regulatory networks that drive transcriptional programs. Although these technologies are frequently used in biological studies, NGS data analysis remains a challenging, time-consuming, and often irreproducible process. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive and flexible workflow platform that can accelerate data processing and analysis so more time can be spent on functional studies. Results: We have developed an integrative, stand-alone workflow platform, named CIPHER, for the systematic analysis of several commonly used NGS datasets including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, MNase-seq, DNase-seq, GRO-seq, and ATAC-seq data. CIPHER implements various open source software packages, in-house scripts, and Docker containers to analyze and process single-ended and pair-ended datasets. CIPHER's pipelines conduct extensive quality and contamination control checks, as well as comprehensive downstream analysis. A typical CIPHER workflow includes: (1) raw sequence evaluation, (2) read trimming and adapter removal, (3) read mapping and quality filtering, (4) visualization track generation, and (5) extensive quality control assessment. Furthermore, CIPHER conducts downstream analysis such as: narrow and broad peak calling, peak annotation, and motif identification for ChIP-seq, differential gene expression analysis for RNA-seq, nucleosome positioning for MNase-seq, DNase hypersensitive site mapping, site annotation and motif identification for DNase-seq, analysis of nascent transcription from Global-Run On (GRO-seq) data, and characterization of chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq datasets. In addition, CIPHER contains an "analysis" mode that completes complex bioinformatics tasks such as enhancer discovery and provides functions to integrate various datasets together. Conclusions: Using public and simulated data, we demonstrate that CIPHER is an efficient and comprehensive workflow platform that can analyze several NGS datasets commonly used in genome biology studies. Additionally, CIPHER's integrative "analysis" mode allows researchers to elicit important biological information from the combined dataset analysis. © 2017 The Author(s).

N2  - Motivation: In recent years we have witnessed an increase in novel RNA-seq based techniques for transcriptomics analysis. Spatial transcriptomics is a novel RNA-seq based technique that allows spatial mapping of transcripts in tissue sections. The spatial resolution adds an extra level of complexity, which requires the development of new tools and algorithms for efficient and accurate data processing.
Results: Here we present a pipeline to automatically and efficiently process RNA-seq data obtained from spatial transcriptomics experiments to generate datasets for downstream analysis.

N2  - Over the last decade, a large number of nucleotide sequences have been generated by next-generation sequencing technologies and deposited to public databases. However, most of these datasets do not specify the sex of individuals sampled because researchers typically ignore or hide this information. Male and female genomes in many species have distinctive sex chromosomes, XX/XY and ZW/ZZ, and expression levels of many sex-related genes differ between the sexes. Herein, we describe how to develop sex marker sequences from syntenic regions of sex chromosomes and use them to quickly identify the sex of individuals being analyzed. Array-based technologies routinely use either known sex markers or the B-allele frequency of X or Z chromosomes to deduce the sex of an individual. The same strategy has been used with whole-exome/genome sequence data; however, all reads must be aligned onto a reference genome to determine the B-allele frequency of the X or Z chromosomes. SEXCMD is a pipeline that can extract sex marker sequences from reference sex chromosomes and rapidly identify the sex of individuals from whole-exome/ genome and RNA sequencing after training with a known dataset through a simple machine learning approach. The pipeline counts total numbers of hits from sex-specific marker sequences and identifies the sex of the individuals sampled based on the fact that XX/ZZ samples do not have Y or W chromosome hits. We have successfully validated our pipeline with mammalian (Homo sapiens; XY) and avian (Gallus gallus; ZW) genomes. Typical calculation time when applying SEXCMD to human whole-exome or RNA sequencing datasets is a few minutes, and analyzing human whole-genome datasets takes about 10 minutes. Another important application of SEXCMD is as a quality control measure to avoid mixing samples before bioinformatics analysis.

N2  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a high-throughput technology that provides unique insights into the transcriptome. It has a wide variety of applications in quantifying genes/isoforms and in detecting non-coding RNA, alternative splicing, and splice junctions. It is extremely important to comprehend the entire transcriptome for a thorough understanding of the cellular system. Several RNA-seq analysis pipelines have been proposed to date. However, no single analysis pipeline can capture dynamics of the entire transcriptome. Here, we compile and present a robust and commonly used analytical pipeline covering the entire spectrum of transcriptome analysis, including quality checks, alignment of reads, differential gene/transcript expression analysis, discovery of cryptic splicing events, and visualization. Challenges, critical parameters, and possible downstream functional analysis pipelines associated with each step are highlighted and discussed. This unit provides a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art RNA-seq analysis pipeline and a greater understanding of the transcriptome. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

N2  - Cell-based assays are an attractive option to measure gene expression response to exposure, but the cost of whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing has been a barrier to the use of gene expression profiling for in vitro toxicity screening. In addition, standard RNA sequencing adds variability due to variable transcript length and amplification. Targeted probe-sequencing technologies such as TempO-Seq, with transcriptomic representation that can vary from hundreds of genes to the entire transcriptome, may reduce some components of variation. Analyses of high-throughput toxicogenomics data require renewed attention to read-calling algorithms and simplified dose-response modeling for datasets with relatively few samples. Using data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes treated with chemicals at varying concentrations, we describe here and make available a pipeline for handling expression data generated by TempO-Seq to align reads, clean and normalize raw count data, identify differentially expressed genes, and calculate transcriptomic concentration-response points of departure. The methods are extensible to other forms of concentration-response gene-expression data, and we discuss the utility of the methods for assessing variation in susceptibility and the diseased cellular state. © 2017 House, Grimm, Jima, Zhou, Rusyn and Wright.

N2  - Background: The three prime untranslated region (3'-UTR) is known to play a pivotal role in modulating gene expression by determining the fate of mRNA. Many crucial developmental events, such as mammalian spermatogenesis, tissue patterning, sex determination and neurogenesis, rely heavily on post-transcriptional regulation by the 3'-UTR. However, 3'-UTR biology seems to be a relatively untapped field, with only limited tools and 3'-UTR resources available. To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of the 3'-UTR on gene expression, firstly the 3'-UTR sequences must be identified. Current 3'-UTR mining tools, such as GETUTR, 3USS and UTRscan, all depend on a well-annotated reference genome or curated 3'-UTR sequences, which hinders their application on a myriad of non-model organisms where the genomes are not available. To address these issues, the establishment of an NGS-based, automated pipeline is urgently needed for genome-wide 3'-UTR prediction in the absence of reference genomes. Results: Here, we propose ExUTR, a novel NGS-based pipeline to predict and retrieve 3'-UTR sequences from RNA-Seq experiments, particularly designed for non-model species lacking well-annotated genomes. This pipeline integrates cutting-edge bioinformatics tools, databases (Uniprot and UTRdb) and novel in-house Perl scripts, implementing a fully automated workflow. By taking transcriptome assemblies as inputs, this pipeline identifies 3'-UTR signals based primarily on the intrinsic features of transcripts, and outputs predicted 3'-UTR candidates together with associated annotations. In addition, ExUTR only requires minimal computational resources, which facilitates its implementation on a standard desktop computer with reasonable runtime, making it affordable to use for most laboratories. We also demonstrate the functionality and extensibility of this pipeline using publically available RNA-Seq data from both model and non-model species, and further validate the accuracy of predicted 3'-UTR using both well-characterized 3'-UTR resources and 3P-Seq data. Conclusions:ExUTR is a practical and powerful workflow that enables rapid genome-wide 3'-UTR discovery from NGS data. The candidates predicted through this pipeline will further advance the study of miRNA target prediction, cis elements in 3'-UTR and the evolution and biology of 3'-UTRs. Being independent of a well-annotated reference genome will dramatically expand its application to much broader research area, encompassing all species for which RNA-Seq is available. © 2017 The Author(s).

N2  - Although many tools have been developed to analyze small RNA sequencing (sRNA-Seq) data, it remains challenging to accurately analyze the small RNA population, mainly due to multiple sequence ID assignment caused by short read length. Additional issues in small RNA analysis include low consistency of microRNA (miRNA) measurement results across different platforms, miRNA mapping associated with miRNA sequence variation (isomiR) and RNA editing, and the origin of those unmapped reads after screening against all endogenous reference sequence databases. To address these issues, we built a comprehensive and customizable sRNA-Seq data analysis pipeline-sRNAnalyzer, which enables: (i) comprehensive miRNA profiling strategies to better handle isomiRs and summarization based on each nucleotide position to detect potential SNPs in miRNAs, (ii) different sequence mapping result assignment approaches to simulate results from microarray/qRT-PCR platforms and a local probabilistic model to assign mapping results to the mostlikely IDs, (iii) comprehensive ribosomal RNA filtering for accurate mapping of exogenous RNAs and summarization based on taxonomy annotation. We evaluated our pipeline on both artificial samples (including synthetic miRNA and Escherichia coli cultures) and biological samples (human tissue and plasma). sRNAnalyzer is implemented in Perl and available at: http://srnanalyzer.systemsbiology.net/. © The Author(s) 2017.

N2  - Background: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is an increasingly popular platform to study heterogeneity at the single-cell level. Computational methods to process scRNA-Seq data are not very accessible to bench scientists as they require a significant amount of bioinformatic skills. Results: We have developed Granatum, a web-based scRNA-Seq analysis pipeline to make analysis more broadly accessible to researchers. Without a single line of programming code, users can click through the pipeline, setting parameters and visualizing results via the interactive graphical interface. Granatum conveniently walks users through various steps of scRNA-Seq analysis. It has a comprehensive list of modules, including plate merging and batch-effect removal, outlier-sample removal, gene-expression normalization, imputation, gene filtering, cell clustering, differential gene expression analysis, pathway/ontology enrichment analysis, protein network interaction visualization, and pseudo-time cell series construction. Conclusions: Granatum enables broad adoption of scRNA-Seq technology by empowering bench scientists with an easy-to-use graphical interface for scRNA-Seq data analysis.

N2  - Designing novel RNA topologies is a challenge, with important therapeutic and industrial applications. We describe a computational pipeline for design of novel RNA topologies based on our coarse-grained RNA-As-Graphs (RAG) framework. RAG represents RNA structures as tree graphs and describes RNA secondary (2D) structure topologies (currently up to 13 vertices, ≈260 nucleotides). We have previously identified novel graph topologies that are RNA-like among these. Here we describe a systematic design pipeline and illustrate design for six broad design problems using recently developed tools for graph-partitioning and fragment assembly (F-RAG). Following partitioning of the target graph, corresponding atomic fragments from our RAG-3D database are combined using F-RAG, and the candidate atomic models are scored using a knowledge-based potential developed for 3D structure prediction. The sequences of the top scoring models are screened further using available tools for 2D structure prediction. The results indicate that our modular approach based on RNA-like topologies rather than specific 2D structures allows for greater flexibility in the design process, and generates a large number of candidate sequences quickly. Experimental structure probing using SHAPE-MaP for two sequences agree with our predictions and suggest that our combined tools yield excellent candidates for further sequence and experimental screening. © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Background and Objective: Docker is a light containerization program that shows almost the same performance as a local environment. Recently, many bioinformatics tools have been distributed as Docker images that include complex settings such as libraries, configurations, and data if needed, as well as the actual tools. Users can simply download and run them without making the effort to compile and configure them, and can obtain reproducible results. In spite of these advantages, several problems remain. First, there is a lack of clear standards for distribution of Docker images, and the Docker Hub often provides multiple images with the same objective but different uses. For these reasons, it can be difficult for users to learn how to select and use them. Second, Docker images are often not suitable as a component of a pipeline, because many of them include big data. Moreover, a group of users can have difficulties when sharing a pipeline composed of Docker images. Users of a group may modify scripts or use different versions of the data, which causes inconsistent results. Methods and Results: To handle the problems described above, we developed a Java web application, DockerBIO, which provides reliable, verified, light-weight Docker images for various bioinformatics tools and for various kinds of reference data. With DockerBIO, users can easily build a pipeline with tools and data registered at DockerBIO, and if necessary, users can easily register new tools or data. Built pipelines are registered in DockerBIO, which provides an efficient running environment for the pipelines registered at DockerBIO. This enables user groups to run their pipelines without expending much effort to copy and modify them. Copyright 2018 Kwon et al.

N2  - RNA-Seq is increasingly being used to measure human RNA expression on a genome-wide scale. Expression profiles can be interrogated to identify and functionally characterize treatment-responsive genes. Ultimately, such controlled studies promise to reveal insights into molecular mechanisms of treatment effects, identify biomarkers, and realize personalized medicine. RNA-Seq Reports (RSEQREP) is a new open-source cloud-enabled framework that allows users to execute start-to-end gene-level RNA-Seq analysis on a preconfigured RSEQREP Amazon Virtual Machine Image (AMI) hosted by AWS or on their own Ubuntu Linux machine via a Docker container or installation script. The framework works with unstranded, stranded, and paired-end sequence FASTQ files stored locally, on Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), or at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). RSEQREP automatically executes a series of customizable steps including reference alignment, CRAM compression, reference alignment QC, data normalization, multivariate data visualization, identification of differentially expressed genes, heatmaps, co-expressed gene clusters, enriched pathways, and a series of custom visualizations. The framework outputs a file collection that includes a dynamically generated PDF report using R, knitr, and LaTeX, as well as publication-ready table and figure files. A user-friendly configuration file handles sample metadata entry, processing, analysis, and reporting options. The configuration supports time series RNA-Seq experimental designs with at least one pre- and one post-treatment sample for each subject, as well as multiple treatment groups and specimen types. All RSEQREP analyses components are built using open-source R code and R/Bioconductor packages allowing for further customization. As a use case, we provide RSEQREP results for a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) RNA-Seq study that collected 1 pre-TIV and 10 post-TIV vaccination samples (days 1-10) for 5 subjects and two specimen types (peripheral blood mononuclear cells and B-cells). © 2018 Jensen TL et al.

N2  - RNA editing increases the diversity of the transcriptome and proteome. Adenosine-to-ino-sine (A-to-I) editing is the predominant type of RNA editing in mammals and it is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) family. Here, we used a largescale computational analysis of transcriptomic data from brain, heart, colon, lung, spleen, kidney, testes, skeletal muscle and liver, from three adult animals in order to identify RNA editing sites in bovine. We developed a computational pipeline and used a rigorous strategy to identify novel editing sites from RNA-Seq data in the absence of corresponding DNA sequence information. Our methods take into account sequencing errors, mapping bias, as well as biological replication to reduce the probability of obtaining a false-positive result. We conducted a detailed characterization of sequence and structural features related to novel candidate sites and found 1,600 novel canonical A-to-I editing sites in the nine bovine tissues analyzed. Results show that these sites 1) occur frequently in clusters and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) repeats, 2) have a preference for guanines depletion/enrichment in the flanking 50/30 nucleotide, 3) occur less often in coding sequences than other regions of the genome, and 4) have low evolutionary conservation. Further, we found that a positive correlation exists between expression of ADAR family members and tissue-specific RNA editing. Most of the genes with predicted A-to-I editing in each tissue were significantly enriched in biological terms relevant to the function of the corresponding tissue. Lastly, the results highlight the importance of the RNA editome in nervous system regulation. The present study extends the list of RNA editing sites in bovine and provides pipelines that may be used to investigate the editome in other organisms. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

N2  - Background: The development of high-throughput experimental technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, have led to new challenges for handling, analyzing and integrating the resulting large and diverse datasets. Bioinformatical analysis of these data commonly requires a number of mutually dependent steps applied to numerous samples for multiple conditions and replicates. To support these analyses, a number of workflow management systems (WMSs) have been developed to allow automated execution of corresponding analysis workflows. Major advantages of WMSs are the easy reproducibility of results as well as the reusability of workflows or their components. Results: In this article, we present Watchdog, a WMS for the automated analysis of large-scale experimental data. Main features include straightforward processing of replicate data, support for distributed computer systems, customizable error detection and manual intervention into workflow execution. Watchdog is implemented in Java and thus platform-independent and allows easy sharing of workflows and corresponding program modules. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for workflow construction using pre-defined modules as well as a helper script for creating new module definitions. Execution of workflows is possible using either the GUI or a command-line interface and a web-interface is provided for monitoring the execution status and intervening in case of errors. To illustrate its potentials on a real-life example, a comprehensive workflow and modules for the analysis of RNA-seq experiments were implemented and are provided with the software in addition to simple test examples. Conclusions:Watchdog is a powerful and flexible WMS for the analysis of large-scale high-throughput experiments. We believe it will greatly benefit both users with and without programming skills who want to develop and apply bioinformatical workflows with reasonable overhead.

N2  - B cells play a critical role in the immune response by producing antibodies, which display remarkable diversity. Here we describe a bioinformatic pipeline, BALDR (BCR Assignment of Lineage using De novo Reconstruction) that accurately reconstructs the paired heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene sequences from Illumina single-cell RNA-seq data. BALDR was accurate for clonotype identification in human and rhesus macaque influenza vaccine and simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine induced vaccine-induced plasmablasts and naïve and antigen-specific memory B cells. BALDR enables matching of clonotype identity with single-cell transcriptional information in B cell lineages and will have broad application in the fields of vaccines, human immunodeficiency virus broadly neutralizing antibody development, and cancer.

N2  - Background: Ginseng is a popular traditional herbal medicine in north-eastern Asia. It has been used for human health for over thousands of years. With the rise in global temperature, the production of Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A.Meyer) in Korea have migrated from mid to northern parts of the Korean peninsula to escape from the various higher temperature related stresses. Under the high ambient temperature, vegetative growth was accelerated, which resulted in early flowering. This precocious phase change led to yield loss. Despite of its importance as a traditional medicine, biological mechanisms of ginseng has not been well studied and even the genome sequence of ginseng is yet to be determined due to its complex genome structure. Thus, it is challenging to investigate the molecular biology mechanisms at the transcript level. Results: To investigate how ginseng responds to the high ambient temperature environment, we performed high throughput RNA sequencing and implemented a bioinformatics pipeline for the integrated analysis of small-RNA and mRNA-seq data without a reference genome. By performing reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR and sanger sequencing of transcripts that were assembled using our pipeline, we validated that their sequences were expressed in our samples. Furthermore, to investigate the interaction between genes and non-coding small RNAs and their regulation status under the high ambient temperature, we identified potential gene regulatory miRNAs. As a result, 100,672 contigs with significant expression level were identified and 6 known, 214 conserved and 60 potential novel miRNAs were predicted to be expressed under the high ambient temperature. Conclusion: Collectively, we have found that development, flowering and temperature responsive genes were induced under high ambient temperature, whereas photosynthesis related genes were repressed. Functional miRNAs were down-regulated under the high ambient temperature. Among them are miR156 and miR396 that target flowering (SPL6/9) and growth regulating genes (GRF) respectively. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Genetic data analysis of large numbers of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), exome chips, and whole exome (WES) or whole-genome (WGS) sequencing data, requires well defined processing steps. As a result, several freely available analytic toolkits have been developed to streamline these processes. Among these, PLINK is the most comprehensive in terms of its quality control and analytic modules, although its focus remains on SNVs. PLINK fulfills two analytic needs-aiding the process of performing quality control (QC) on large data sets and providing basic statistical tools to analyze the variants in genetic models. The current version of PLINK (v1.90b) has incorporated several sophisticated statistical modeling features, such as those that were introduced by GCTA (genome-wide complex trait analysis), including mixed-model association analysis and cluster-based algorithms. Although PLINK is diverse in its applicability to data management and analysis, in some instances, other available tools offer more optimal options. Here we provide a practical overview of major PLINK features with respect to QC, data management, and association mapping, along with learned shortcuts and limitations to be considered. In cases where PLINK features are limited, we provide alternative approaches using additional freely available pipelines. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

N2  - Background: RNA sequencing has become a ubiquitous technology used throughout life sciences as an effective method of measuring RNA abundance quantitatively in tissues and cells. The increase in use of RNA-seq technology has led to the continuous development of new tools for every step of analysis from alignment to downstream pathway analysis. However, effectively using these analysis tools in a scalable and reproducible way can be challenging, especially for non-experts. Results: Using the workflow management system Snakemake we have developed a user friendly, fast, efficient, and comprehensive pipeline for RNA-seq analysis. VIPER (Visualization Pipeline for RNA-seq analysis) is an analysis workflow that combines some of the most popular tools to take RNA-seq analysis from raw sequencing data, through alignment and quality control, into downstream differential expression and pathway analysis. VIPER has been created in a modular fashion to allow for the rapid incorporation of new tools to expand the capabilities. This capacity has already been exploited to include very recently developed tools that explore immune infiltrate and T-cell CDR (Complementarity-Determining Regions) reconstruction abilities. The pipeline has been conveniently packaged such that minimal computational skills are required to download and install the dozens of software packages that VIPER uses. Conclusions: VIPER is a comprehensive solution that performs most standard RNA-seq analyses quickly and effectively with a built-in capacity for customization and expansion. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - The single-molecule real-time (SMRT) isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) based on Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) platform has received increasing attention for its ability to explore full-length isoforms. Thus, comprehensive tools for Iso-Seq bioinformatics analysis are extremely useful. Here, we present a one-stop solution for Iso-Seq analysis, called PRAPI to analyze alternative transcription initiation (ATI), alternative splicing (AS), alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA), natural antisense transcripts (NAT), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) comprehensively. PRAPI is capable of combining Iso-Seq full-length isoforms with short read data, such as RNA-Seq or polyadenylation site sequencing (PAS-seq) for differential expression analysis of NAT, AS, APA and circRNAs. Furthermore, PRAPI can annotate new genes and correct mis-annotated genes when gene annotation is available. Finally, PRAPI generates high-quality vector graphics to visualize and highlight the Iso-Seq results.

N2  - Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses can benefit from performing a genome-guided and de novo assembly, in particular for species where the reference genome or the annotation is incomplete. However, tools for integrating an assembled transcriptome with reference annotation are lacking. Findings: Necklace is a software pipeline that runs genome-guided and de novo assembly and combines the resulting transcriptomes with reference genome annotations. Necklace constructs a compact but comprehensive superTranscriptome out of the assembled and reference data. Reads are subsequently aligned and counted in preparation for differential expression testing. Conclusions: Necklace allows a comprehensive transcriptome to be built from a combination of assembled and annotated transcripts, which results in a more comprehensive transcriptome for the majority of organisms. In addition RNA-seq data are mapped back to this newly created superTranscript reference to enable differential expression testing with standard methods.

N2  - Background: Complex microbial communities are an area of growing interest in biology. Metatranscriptomics allows researchers to quantify microbial gene expression in an environmental sample via high-throughput sequencing. Metatranscriptomic experiments are computationally intensive because the experiments generate a large volume of sequence data and each sequence must be compared with reference sequences from thousands of organisms. Results: SAMSA2 is an upgrade to the original Simple Annotation of Metatranscriptomes by Sequence Analysis (SAMSA) pipeline that has been redesigned for standalone use on a supercomputing cluster. SAMSA2 is faster due to the use of the DIAMOND aligner, and more flexible and reproducible because it uses local databases. SAMSA2 is available with detailed documentation, and example input and output files along with examples of master scripts for full pipeline execution. Conclusions: SAMSA2 is a rapid and efficient metatranscriptome pipeline for analyzing large RNA-seq datasets in a supercomputing cluster environment. SAMSA2 provides simplified output that can be examined directly or used for further analyses, and its reference databases may be upgraded, altered or customized to fit the needs of any experiment. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: The field of small RNA is one of the most investigated research areas since they were shown to regulate transposable elements and gene expression and play essential roles in fundamental biological processes. Small RNA deep sequencing (sRNA-seq) is now routinely used for large-scale analyses of small RNA. Such high-throughput sequencing typically produces several millions reads. Results: Here we present a computational pipeline (sRNAPipe: small RNA pipeline) based on the Galaxy framework that takes as input a fastq file of small RNA-seq reads and performs successive steps of mapping to categories of genomic sequences: transposable elements, gene transcripts, microRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs. It also provides individual mapping and counting for chromosomes, transposable elements and gene transcripts, normalization, small RNA length analysis and plotting of the data along genomic coordinates to build publication-quality graphs and figures. sRNAPipe evaluates 10-nucleotide 5′-overlaps of reads on opposite strands to test ping-pong amplification for putative PIWI-interacting RNAs, providing counts of overlaps and corresponding z-scores. Conclusions: sRNAPipe is easy to use and does not require command-line or coding knowledge. This pipeline gives quick visual and quantitative results, which are usable for publications. sRNAPipe is freely available as a Galaxy tool and via GitHub. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows researchers to profile the transcriptomes of thousands of cells simultaneously. Protocols that incorporate both designed and random barcodes have greatly increased the throughput of scRNA-seq, but give rise to a more complex data structure. There is a need for new tools that can handle the various barcoding strategies used by different protocols and exploit this information for quality assessment at the sample-level and provide effective visualization of these results in preparation for higher-level analyses. To this end, we developed scPipe, an R/Bioconductor package that integrates barcode demultiplexing, read alignment, UMI-aware gene-level quantification and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple protocols that include CEL-seq, MARS-seq, Chromium 10X, Drop-seq and Smart-seq. scPipe produces a count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with an HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing. scPipe performs this processing in a few simple R commands, promoting reproducible analysis of single-cell data that is compatible with the emerging suite of open-source scRNA-seq analysis tools available in R/Bioconductor and beyond.

N2  - Abstract In bioinformatics, as well as other computationally intensive research fields, there is a need for workflows that can reliably produce consistent output, from known sources, independent of the software environment or configuration settings of the machine on which they are executed. Indeed, this is essential for controlled comparison between different observations and for the wider dissemination of workflows. However, providing this type of reproducibility and traceability is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which generally comes in various versions. Moreover, in many fields (bioinformatics being a prime example), these versions are subject to continual change due to rapidly evolving technologies, further complicating problems related to reproducibility. Here, we propose a principled approach for building analysis pipelines and managing their dependencies with GNU Guix. As a case study to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present a set of highly reproducible pipelines called PiGx for the analysis of RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, bisulfite-treated DNA sequencing, and single-cell resolution RNA sequencing. All pipelines process raw experimental data and generate reports containing publication-ready plots and figures, with interactive report elements and standard observables. Users may install these highly reproducible packages and apply them to their own datasets without any special computational expertise beyond the use of the command line. We hope such a toolkit will provide immediate benefit to laboratory workers wishing to process their own datasets or bioinformaticians seeking to automate all, or parts of, their analyses. In the long term, we hope our approach to reproducibility will serve as a blueprint for reproducible workflows in other areas. Our pipelines, along with their corresponding documentation and sample reports, are available at http://bioinformatics.mdc-Berlin.de/pigx. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Targeted resequencing has become the most used and cost-effective approach for identifying causative mutations of Mendelian diseases both for diagnostics and research purposes. Due to very rapid technological progress, NGS laboratories are expanding their capabilities to address the increasing number of analyses. Several open source tools are available to build a generic variant calling pipeline, but a tool able to simultaneously execute multiple analyses, organize, and categorize the samples is still missing. Results: Here we describe VarGenius, a Linux based command line software able to execute customizable pipelines for the analysis of multiple targeted resequencing data using parallel computing. VarGenius provides a database to store the output of the analysis (calling quality statistics, variant annotations, internal allelic variant frequencies) and sample information (personal data, genotypes, phenotypes). VarGenius can also perform the "joint analysis" of hundreds of samples with a single command, drastically reducing the time for the configuration and execution of the analysis. VarGenius executes the standard pipeline of the Genome Analysis Tool-Kit (GATK) best practices (GBP) for germinal variant calling, annotates the variants using Annovar, and generates a user-friendly output displaying the results through a web page. VarGenius has been tested on a parallel computing cluster with 52 machines with 120GB of RAM each. Under this configuration, a 50 M whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis for a family was executed in about 7h (trio or quartet); a joint analysis of 30 WES in about 24 h and the parallel analysis of 34 single samples from a 1 M panel in about 2 h. Conclusions: We developed VarGenius, a "master" tool that faces the increasing demand of heterogeneous NGS analyses and allows maximum flexibility for downstream analyses. It paves the way to a different kind of analysis, centered on cohorts rather than on singleton. Patient and variant information are stored into the database and any output file can be accessed programmatically. VarGenius can be used for routine analyses by biomedical researchers with basic Linux skills providing additional flexibility for computational biologists to develop their own algorithms for the comparison and analysis of data.

Toolsets available for in-depth analysis of scRNA-seq datasets by biologists with little informatics experience is limited. Here, we describe an informatics tool (PyMINEr) that fully automates cell type identification, cell type-specific pathway analyses, graph theory-based analysis of gene regulation, and detection of autocrine-paracrine signaling networks in silico. We applied PyMINEr to interrogate human pancreatic islet scRNA-seq datasets and discovered several features of co-expression graphs, including concordance of scRNA-seq-graph structure with both protein-protein interactions and 3D genomic architecture, association of high-connectivity and low-expression genes with cell type enrichment, and potential for the graph structure to clarify potential etiologies of enigmatic disease-associated variants. We further created a consensus co-expression network and autocrine-paracrine signaling networks within and across islet cell types from seven datasets. PyMINEr correctly identified changes in BMP-WNT signaling associated with cystic fibrosis pancreatic acinar cell loss. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that the PyMINEr framework will be a valuable resource for scRNA-seq analyses. © 2019 The Author(s)

N2  - Background: Genetically engineered mice (GEM) are essential tools for understanding gene function and disease modeling. Historically, gene targeting was first done in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the 129 family of inbred strains, leading to a mixed background or congenic mice when crossed with C57BL/6 mice. Depending on the number of backcrosses and breeding strategies, genomic segments from 129-derived ESCs can be introgressed into the C57BL/6 genome, establishing a unique genetic makeup that needs characterization in order to obtain valid conclusions from experiments using GEM lines. Currently, SNP genotyping is used to detect the extent of 129-derived ESC genome introgression into C57BL/6 recipients; however, it fails to detect novel/rare variants. Results: Here, we present a computational pipeline implemented in the Galaxy platform and in BASH/R script to determine genetic introgression of GEM using next generation sequencing data (NGS), such as whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq. The pipeline includes strategies to uncover variants linked to a targeted locus, genome-wide variant visualization, and the identification of potential modifier genes. Although these methods apply to congenic mice, they can also be used to describe variants fixed by genetic drift. As a proof of principle, we analyzed publicly available RNA-Seq data from five congenic knockout (KO) lines and our own RNA-Seq data from the Sall2 KO line. Additionally, we performed target validation using several genetics approaches. Conclusions: We revealed the impact of the 129-derived ESC genome introgression on gene expression, predicted potential modifier genes, and identified potential phenotypic interference in KO lines. Our results demonstrate that our new approach is an effective method to determine genetic introgression of GEM. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Backgrounds: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is now widely used in biomedical research for various applications. Processing of NGS data requires multiple programs and customization of the processing pipelines according to the data platforms. However, rapid progress of the NGS applications and processing methods urgently require prompt update of the pipelines. Recent clinical applications of NGS technology such as cell-free DNA, cancer panel, or exosomal RNA sequencing data also require appropriate customization of the processing pipelines. Here, we developed SEQprocess, a highly extendable framework that can provide standard as well as customized pipelines for NGS data processing. Results: SEQprocess was implemented in an R package with fully modularized steps for data processing that can be easily customized. Currently, six pre-customized pipelines are provided that can be easily executed by non-experts such as biomedical scientists, including the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) pipelines as well as the popularly used pipelines for variant calling (e.g., GATK) and estimation of allele frequency, RNA abundance (e.g., TopHat2/Cufflink), or DNA copy numbers (e.g., Sequenza). In addition, optimized pipelines for the clinical sequencing from cell-free DNA or miR-Seq are also provided. The processed data were transformed into R package-compatible data type 'ExpressionSet' or 'SummarizedExperiment', which could facilitate subsequent data analysis within R environment. Finally, an automated report summarizing the processing steps are also provided to ensure reproducibility of the NGS data analysis. Conclusion: SEQprocess provides a highly extendable and R compatible framework that can manage customized and reproducible pipelines for handling multiple legacy NGS processing tools. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - RNA cytosine-5 methylation (m 5 C) has emerged as a key epitranscriptomic mark, which fulfills multiple roles in structural modulation, stress signaling and the regulation of protein translation. Bisulfite sequencing is currently the most accurate and reliable method to detect m 5 C marks at nucleotide resolution. Targeted bisulfite sequencing allows m 5 C detection at single base resolution, by combining the use of tailored primers with bisulfite treatment. A number of computational tools currently exist to analyse m 5 C marks in DNA bisulfite sequencing. However, these methods are not directly applicable to the analysis of RNA m 5 C marks, because DNA analysis focuses on CpG methylation, and because artifactual unconversion and misamplification in RNA can obscure actual methylation signals. We describe a pipeline designed specifically for RNA cytosine-5 methylation analysis in targeted bisulfite sequencing experiments. The pipeline is directly applicable to Illumina MiSeq (or equivalent) sequencing datasets using a web interface (https://bisamp.dkfz.de), and is defined by optimized mapping parameters and the application of tailored filters for the removal of artifacts. We provide examples for the application of this pipeline in the unambiguous detection of m 5 C marks in tRNAs from mouse embryonic stem cells and neuron-differentiated stem cells as well as in 28S rRNA from human fibroblasts. Finally, we also discuss the adaptability of BisAMP to the analysis of DNA methylation. Our pipeline provides an accurate, fast and user-friendly framework for the analysis of cytosine-5 methylation in amplicons from bisulfite-treated RNA. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The availability of low-cost small-factor sequencers, such as the Illumina MiSeq, MiniSeq, or iSeq, have paved the way for democratizing genomics sequencing, providing researchers in minority universities with access to the technology that was previously only affordable by institutions with large core facilities. However, these instruments are not bundled with software for performing bioinformatics data analysis, and the data analysis can be the main bottleneck for independent laboratories or even small clinical facilities that consider adopting genomic sequencing for medical applications. To address this issue, we have developed miCloud, a bioinformatics platform that enables genomic data analysis through a fully featured data analysis cloud, which seamlessly integrates with genome sequencers over the local network. The miCloud can be easily deployed without any prior bioinformatics expertise on any computing environment, from a laboratory computer workstation to a university computer cluster. Our platform not only provides access to a set of preconfigured RNA-Seq and CHIP-Seq bioinformatics pipelines, but also enables users to develop or install new preconfigured tools from the large selection available on open-source online Docker container repositories. The miCloud built-in analysis pipelines are also integrated with the Visual Omics Explorer framework (Kim et al., 2016), which provides rich interactive visualizations and publication-ready graphics from the next-generation sequencing data. Ultimately, the miCloud demonstrates a bioinformatics approach that can be adopted in the field for standardizing genomic data analysis, similarly to the way molecular biology sample preparation kits have standardized laboratory operations. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.

N2  - Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq, currently dominate genome-wide gene expression studies. A standard approach to analyse this data requires mapping sequence reads to a reference and counting the number of reads which map to each gene. However, for many transcriptome studies, a suitable reference genome is unavailable, especially for meta-transcriptome studies which assay gene expression from mixed populations of organisms. Where a reference is unavailable, it is possible to generate a reference by the de novo assembly of the sequence reads. However, the high cost of generating high-coverage data for de novo assembly hinders this approach and more importantly the accurate assembly of such data is challenging, especially for meta-transcriptome data, and resulting assemblies frequently suffer from collapsed regions or chimeric sequences. As an alternative to the standard reference mapping approach, we have developed a k-mer-based analysis pipeline (DiffKAP) to identify differentially expressed reads between RNA-Seq datasets without the requirement for a reference. We compared the DiffKAP approach with the traditional Tophat/Cuffdiff method using RNA-Seq data from soybean, which has a suitable reference genome. We subsequently examined differential gene expression for a coral meta-transcriptome where no reference is available, and validated the results using qRT-PCR. We conclude that DiffKAP is an accurate method to study differential gene expression in complex meta-transcriptomes without the requirement of a reference genome. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background: RNA-Seq technology is routinely used to characterize the transcriptome, and to detect gene expression differences among cell types, genotypes and conditions. Advances in short-read sequencing instruments such as Illumina Next-Seq have yielded easy-to-operate machines, with high throughput, at a lower price per base. However, processing this data requires bioinformatics expertise to tailor and execute specific solutions for each type of library preparation. Results: In order to enable fast and user-friendly data analysis, we developed an intuitive and scalable transcriptome pipeline that executes the full process, starting from cDNA sequences derived by RNA-Seq [Nat Rev Genet 10:57-63, 2009] and bulk MARS-Seq [Science 343:776-779, 2014] and ending with sets of differentially expressed genes. Output files are placed in structured folders, and results summaries are provided in rich and comprehensive reports, containing dozens of plots, tables and links. Conclusion: Our User-friendly Transcriptome Analysis Pipeline (UTAP) is an open source, web-based intuitive platform available to the biomedical research community, enabling researchers to efficiently and accurately analyse transcriptome sequence data. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Rapid advances in genomic technologies have facilitated the identification pathogenic variants causing human disease. We report siblings with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy due to a novel, shared heterozygous pathogenic 13 bp duplication in SYNGAP1 (c.435_447dup, p.(L150Vfs*6)) that was identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS). The pathogenic variant had escaped earlier detection via two methodologies: whole exome sequencing and high-depth targeted sequencing. Both technologies had produced reads carrying the variant, however, they were either not aligned due to the size of the insertion or aligned to multiple major histocompatibility complex (MHC) regions in the hg19 reference genome, making the critical reads unavailable for variant calling. The WGS pipeline followed different protocols, including alignment of reads to the GRCh37 reference genome, which lacks the additional MHC contigs. Our findings highlight the benefit of using orthogonal clinical bioinformatic pipelines and all relevant inheritance patterns to re-analyze genomic data in undiagnosed patients. © 2018 The Authors.

N2  - Most of the research studies developed applying microarray technology to the characterization of different pathological states of any disease may fail in reaching statistically significant results. This is largely due to the small repertoire of analysed samples, and to the limitation in the number of states or pathologies usually addressed. Moreover, the influence of potential deviations on the gene expression quantification is usually disregarded. In spite of the continuous changes in omic sciences, reflected for instance in the emergence of new Next-Generation Sequencing-related technologies, the existing availability of a vast amount of gene expression microarray datasets should be properly exploited. Therefore, this work proposes a novel methodological approach involving the integration of several heterogeneous skin cancer series, and a later multiclass classifier design. This approach is thus a way to provide the clinicians with an intelligent diagnosis support tool based on the use of a robust set of selected biomarkers, which simultaneously distinguishes among different cancerrelated skin states. To achieve this, a multi-platform combination of microarray datasets from Affymetrix and Illumina manufacturers was carried out. This integration is expected to strengthen the statistical robustness of the study as well as the finding of highly-reliable skin cancer biomarkers. Specifically, the designed operation pipeline has allowed the identification of a small subset of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from which to distinguish among 7 involved skin states. These genes were obtained from the assessment of a number of potential batch effects on the gene expression data. The biological interpretation of these genes was inspected in the specific literature to understand their underlying information in relation to skin cancer. Finally, in order to assess their possible effectiveness in cancer diagnosis, a cross-validation Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based classification including feature ranking was performed. The accuracy attained exceeded the 92% in overall recognition of the 7 different cancer-related skin states. The proposed integration scheme is expected to allow the co-integration with other state-of-the-art technologies such as RNA-seq.

N2  - Background: Many bioinformatics pipelines are available nowadays to analyze transcriptomics data produced by high-throughput RNA sequencing. They implement different workflows that address several analysis tasks, supported by the use of third party programs. Nevertheless, a proper workflow definition for RNA-seq data analysis is still lacking. Objective: To proper define what a comprehensive RNA-seq data analysis workflow should be. Compare all available pipelines and, if such a solution is not available, implement a new pipeline. Method: We have developed a new pipeline integrating state-of-the art programs for different parts of the RNA-seq analysis. We also have used RUbioSeq libraries to achieve a scalable solution. Results: We have defined a comprehensive RNA-seq data analysis workflow, comprising the most common needs demanded by biologists and implemented it in a new pipeline, nextpresso. We also validate it in two case studies presented here. Conclusion: Nexpresso is a new, freely available, pipeline covering the most common needs of RNA-seq data analysis. It is easy to configure, generates user friendly results and scales well for larger studies comprising a high number of samples.

N2  - RNA-seq using the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach is a common technology to analyze large-scale RNA transcript data for gene expression studies. However, an appropriate bioinformatics tool is needed to analyze a large amount of transcriptomes data from RNA-seq experiment. The aim of this study was to construct a system that can be easily applied to analyze RNA-seq data. RNA-seq analysis tool as SMART-RDA was constructed in this study. It is a computational workflow based on Galaxy framework to be used for analyzing RNA-seq raw data into gene expression information. This workflow was adapted from a well-known Tuxedo Protocol for RNA-seq analysis with some modifications. Expression value from each transcriptome was quantitatively stated as Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million fragments (FPKM). RNA-seq data of sterile and fertile oil palm (Pisifera) pollens derived from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) NCBI were used to test this workflow in local facility Galaxy server. The results showed that differentially gene expression in pollens might be responsible for sterile and fertile characteristics in palm oil Pisifera.

N2  - Motivation: A large choice of tools exists for many standard tasks in the analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. However, once a project deviates from standard workflows, custom scripts are needed. Results: We present HTSeq, a Python library to facilitate the rapid development of such scripts. HTSeq offers parsers for many common data formats in HTS projects, as well as classes to represent data, such as genomic coordinates, sequences, sequencing reads, alignments, gene model information and variant calls, and provides data structures that allow for querying via genomic coordinates. We also present htseq-count, a tool developed with HTSeq that preprocesses RNA-Seq data for differential expression analysis by counting the overlap of reads with genes.

N2  - Whole exome sequencing has facilitated the discovery of causal genetic variants associated with human diseases at deep coverage and low cost. In particular, the detection of somatic mutations from tumor/normal pairs has provided insights into the cancer genome. Although there is an abundance of publicly-available software for the detection of germline and somatic variants, concordance is generally limited among variant callers and alignment algorithms. Successful integration of variants detected by multiple methods requires in-depth knowledge of the software, access to high-performance computing resources, and advanced programming techniques. We present ExScalibur, a set of fully automated, highly scalable and modulated pipelines for whole exome data analysis. The suite integrates multiple alignment and variant calling algorithms for the accurate detection of germline and somatic mutations with close to 99% sensitivity and specificity. ExScalibur implements streamlined execution of analytical modules, real-time monitoring of pipeline progress, robust handling of errors and intuitive documentation that allows for increased reproducibility and sharing of results and workflows. It runs on local computers, high-performance computing clusters and cloud environments. In addition, we provide a data analysis report utility to facilitate visualization of the results that offers interactive exploration of quality control files, read alignment and variant calls, assisting downstream customization of potential disease-causing mutations. ExScalibur is open-source and is also available as a public image on Amazon cloud.

N2  - Background: Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies have enabled the sequencing of several individual human genomes. These technologies are also being used in novel ways for mRNA expression profiling, genome-wide discovery of transcription-factor binding sites, small RNA discovery, etc. The multitude of sequencing platforms, each with their unique characteristics, pose a number of design challenges, regarding the technology to be used and the depth of sequencing required for a particular sequencing application. Here we describe a number of analytical and empirical results to address design questions for two applications: detection of structural variations from paired-end sequencing and estimating mRNA transcript abundance. Results: For structural variation, our results provide explicit trade-offs between the detection and resolution of rearrangement breakpoints, and the optimal mix of paired-read insert lengths. Specifically, we prove that optimal detection and resolution of breakpoints is achieved using a mix of exactly two insert library lengths. Furthermore, we derive explicit formulae to determine these insert length combinations, enabling a 15% improvement in breakpoint detection at the same experimental cost. On empirical short read data, these predictions show good concordance with Illumina 200 bp and 2 Kbp insert length libraries. For transcriptome sequencing, we determine the sequencing depth needed to detect rare transcripts from a small pilot study. With only 1 Million reads, we derive corrections that enable almost perfect prediction of the underlying expression probability distribution, and use this to predict the sequencing depth required to detect low expressed genes with greater than 95% probability. Conclusions: Together, our results form a generic framework for many design considerations related to high-throughput sequencing. We provide software tools http://bix.ucsd.edu/projects/NGS-DesignTools to derive platform independent guidelines for designing sequencing experiments (amount of sequencing, choice of insert length, mix of libraries) for novel applications of next generation sequencing.

N2  - The initial steps in the analysis of next-generation sequencing data can be automated by way of software 'pipelines'. However, individual components depreciate rapidly because of the evolving technology and analysis methods, often rendering entire versions of production informatics pipelines obsolete. Constructing pipelines from Linux bash commands enables the use of hot swappable modular components as opposed to the more rigid program call wrapping by higher level languages, as implemented in comparable published pipelining systems. Here we present Next Generation Sequencing ANalysis for Enterprises (NGSANE), a Linux-based, high-performance-computing-enabled framework that minimizes overhead for set up and processing of new projects, yet maintains full flexibility of custom scripting when processing raw sequence data.

N2  - Background: In the past decade, transcriptome data have become an important component of many phylogenetic studies. They are a cost-effective source of protein-coding gene sequences, and have helped projects grow from a few genes to hundreds or thousands of genes. Phylogenetic studies now regularly include genes from newly sequenced transcriptomes, as well as publicly available transcriptomes and genomes. Implementing such a phylogenomic study, however, is computationally intensive, requires the coordinated use of many complex software tools, and includes multiple steps for which no published tools exist. Phylogenomic studies have therefore been manual or semiautomated. In addition to taking considerable user time, this makes phylogenomic analyses difficult to reproduce, compare, and extend. In addition, methodological improvements made in the context of one study often cannot be easily applied and evaluated in the context of other studies. Results: We present Agalma, an automated tool that constructs matrices for phylogenomic analyses. The user provides raw Illumina transcriptome data, and Agalma produces annotated assemblies, aligned gene sequence matrices, a preliminary phylogeny, and detailed diagnostics that allow the investigator to make extensive assessments of intermediate analysis steps and the final results. Sequences from other sources, such as externally assembled genomes and transcriptomes, can also be incorporated in the analyses. Agalma is built on the BioLite bioinformatics framework, which tracks provenance, profiles processor and memory use, records diagnostics, manages metadata, installs dependencies, logs version numbers and calls to external programs, and enables rich HTML reports for all stages of the analysis. Agalma includes a small test data set and a built-in test analysis of these data. In addition to describing Agalma, we here present a sample analysis of a larger seven-taxon data set. Agalma is available for download at https://bitbucket.org/caseywdunn/agalma. Conclusions: Agalma allows complex phylogenomic analyses to be implemented and described unambiguously as a series of high-level commands. This will enable phylogenomic studies to be readily reproduced, modified, and extended. Agalma also facilitates methods development by providing a complete modular workflow, bundled with test data, that will allow further optimization of each step in the context of a full phylogenomic analysis.

N2  - Motivation: Omics Pipe (http://sulab.scripps.edu/omicspipe) is a computational framework that automates multi-omics data analysis pipelines on high performance compute clusters and in the cloud. It supports best practice published pipelines for RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, Exome-seq, Whole-Genome sequencing, ChIP-seq analyses and automatic processing of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Omics Pipe provides researchers with a tool for reproducible, open source and extensible next generation sequencing analysis. The goal of Omics Pipe is to democratize next-generation sequencing analysis by dramatically increasing the accessibility and reproducibility of best practice computational pipelines, which will enable researchers to generate biologically meaningful and interpretable results. Results: Using Omics Pipe, we analyzed 100 TCGA breast invasive carcinoma paired tumor-normal datasets based on the latest UCSC hg19 RefSeq annotation. Omics Pipe automatically downloaded and processed the desired TCGA samples on a high throughput compute cluster to produce a results report for each sample. We aggregated the individual sample results and compared them to the analysis in the original publications. This comparison revealed high overlap between the analyses, as well as novel findings due to the use of updated annotations and methods.

N2  - Next-generation sequencing is rapidly becoming the approach of choice for transcriptional analysis experiments. Substantial advances have been achieved in computational approaches to support these technologies. These approaches typically rely on existing transcript annotations, introducing a bias towards known genes, require specific experimental design and computational resources, or focus only on identification of splice variants (ignoring other biologically relevant transcribed features contained within the data that may be important for downstream analysis). Biologically relevant transcribed features also include large and small non-coding RNA, new transcription start sites, alternative promoters, RNA editing and processing of coding transcripts. Also, many existing solutions lack accessible interfaces required for wide scale adoption. We present a user-friendly, rapid and computation-efficient feature annotation framework (RNA-eXpress) that enables identification of transcripts and other genomic and transcriptional features independently of current annotations. RNA-eXpress accepts mapped reads in the standard binary alignment (BAM) format and produces a study-specific feature annotation in GTF format, comparison statistics, sequence extraction and feature counts. The framework is designed to be easily accessible while allowing advanced users to integrate new feature-identification algorithms through simple class extension, thus facilitating expansion to novel feature types or identification of study-specific feature types. Availability and implementation: RNA-eXpress software, source code, user manuals, supporting tutorials, developer guides and example data are available at http://www.rnaexpress.org.

N2  - Background: The low concordance between different variant calling methods still poses a challenge for the wide-spread application of next-generation sequencing in research and clinical practice. A wide range of variant annotations can be used for filtering call sets in order to improve the precision of the variant calls, but the choice of the appropriate filtering thresholds is not straightforward. Variant quality score recalibration provides an alternative solution to hard filtering, but it requires large-scale, genomic data. Results: We evaluated germline variant calling pipelines based on BWA and Bowtie 2 aligners in combination with GATK UnifiedGenotyper, GATK HaplotypeCaller, FreeBayes and SAMtools variant callers, using simulated and real benchmark sequencing data (NA12878 with Illumina Platinum Genomes). We argue that these pipelines are not merely discordant, but they extract complementary useful information. We introduce VariantMetaCaller to test the hypothesis that the automated fusion of measurement related information allows better performance than the recommended hard-filtering settings or recalibration and the fusion of the individual call sets without using annotations. VariantMetaCaller uses Support Vector Machines to combine multiple information sources generated by variant calling pipelines and estimates probabilities of variants. This novel method had significantly higher sensitivity and precision than the individual variant callers in all target region sizes, ranging from a few hundred kilobases to whole exomes. We also demonstrated that VariantMetaCaller supports a quantitative, precision based filtering of variants under wider conditions. Specifically, the computed probabilities of the variants can be used to order the variants, and for a given threshold, probabilities can be used to estimate precision. Precision then can be directly translated to the number of true called variants, or equivalently, to the number of false calls, which allows finding problem-specific balance between sensitivity and precision. Conclusions: VariantMetaCaller can be applied to small target regions and whole exomes as well, and it can be used in cases of organisms for which highly accurate variant call sets are not yet available, therefore it can be a viable alternative to hard filtering in cases where variant quality score recalibration cannot be used. VariantMetaCaller is freely available at http://bioinformatics.mit.bme.hu/VariantMetaCaller.

N2  - Background: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq), enables unbiased and genome-wide mapping of protein-DNA interactions and epigenetic marks. The first step in ChIP-seq data analysis involves the identification of peaks (i.e., genomic locations with high density of mapped sequence reads). The next step consists of interpreting the biological meaning of the peaks through their association with known genes, pathways, regulatory elements, and integration with other experiments. Although several programs have been published for the analysis of ChIP-seq data, they often focus on the peak detection step and are usually not well suited for thorough, integrative analysis of the detected peaks. Results: To address the peak interpretation challenge, we have developed ChIPseeqer, an integrative, comprehensive, fast and user-friendly computational framework for in-depth analysis of ChIP-seq datasets. The novelty of our approach is the capability to combine several computational tools in order to create easily customized workflows that can be adapted to the user's needs and objectives. In this paper, we describe the main components of the ChIPseeqer framework, and also demonstrate the utility and diversity of the analyses offered, by analyzing a published ChIP-seq dataset. Conclusions: ChIPseeqer facilitates ChIP-seq data analysis by offering a flexible and powerful set of computational tools that can be used in combination with one another. The framework is freely available as a user-friendly GUI application, but all programs are also executable from the command line, thus providing flexibility and automatability for advanced users.

N2  - In this work, we present the Genome Modeling System (GMS), an analysis information management system capable of executing automated genome analysis pipelines at a massive scale. The GMS framework provides detailed tracking of samples and data coupled with reliable and repeatable analysis pipelines. The GMS also serves as a platform for bioinformatics development, allowing a large team to collaborate on data analysis, or an individual researcher to leverage the work of others effectively within its data management system. Rather than separating ad-hoc analysis from rigorous, reproducible pipelines, the GMS promotes systematic integration between the two. As a demonstration of the GMS, we performed an integrated analysis of whole genome, exome and transcriptome sequencing data from a breast cancer cell line (HCC1395) and matched lymphoblastoid line (HCC1395BL). These data are available for users to test the software, complete tutorials and develop novel GMS pipeline configurations.

N2  - The advent of next-generation sequencing for functional genomics has given rise to quantities of sequence information that are often so large that they are difficult to handle. Moreover, sequence reads from a specific individual can contain sufficient information to potentially identify and genetically characterize that person, raising privacy concerns. In order to address these issues, we have developed the Mapped Read Format (MRF), a compact data summary format for both short and long read alignments that enables the anonymization of confidential sequence information, while allowing one to still carry out many functional genomics studies. We have developed a suite of tools (RSEQtools) that use this format for the analysis of RNA-Seq experiments. These tools consist of a set of modules that perform common tasks such as calculating gene expression values, generating signal tracks of mapped reads and segmenting that signal into actively transcribed regions. Moreover, the tools can readily be used to build customizable RNA-Seq workflows. In addition to the anonymization afforded by MRF, this format also facilitates the decoupling of the alignment of reads from downstream analyses.

High-Throughput Omics and Data Integration Workshop

N2  - High-throughput sequencing assays are now routinely used to study different aspects of genome organization. As decreasing costs and widespread availability of sequencing enable more laboratories to use sequencing assays in their research projects, the number of samples and replicates in these experiments can quickly grow to several dozens of samples and thus require standardized annotation, storage and management of preprocessing steps. As a part of the STATegra project, we have developed an Experiment Management System (EMS) for high throughput omics data that supports different types of sequencing-based assays such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Methyl-seq, etc, as well as proteomics and metabolomics data. The STATegra EMS provides metadata annotation of experimental design, samples and processing pipelines, as well as storage of different types of data files, from raw data to ready-to-use measurements. The system has been developed to provide research laboratories with a freely-available, integrated system that offers a simple and effective way for experiment annotation and tracking of analysis procedures.

N2  - Background: Large-scale sequencing experiments are complex and require a wide spectrum of computational tools to extract and interpret relevant biological information. This is especially true in projects where individual processing and integrated analysis of both small RNA and complementary RNA data is needed. Such studies would benefit from a computational workflow that is easy to implement and standardizes the processing and analysis of both sequenced data types. Results: We developed SePIA (Sequence Processing, Integration, and Analysis), a comprehensive small RNA and RNA workflow. It provides ready execution for over 20 commonly known RNA-seq tools on top of an established workflow engine and provides dynamic pipeline architecture to manage, individually analyze, and integrate both small RNA and RNA data. Implementation with Docker makes SePIA portable and easy to run. We demonstrate the workflow's extensive utility with two case studies involving three breast cancer datasets. SePIA is straightforward to configure and organizes results into a perusable HTML report. Furthermore, the underlying pipeline engine supports computational resource management for optimal performance. Conclusion: SePIA is an open-source workflow introducing standardized processing and analysis of RNA and small RNA data. SePIA's modular design enables robust customization to a given experiment while maintaining overall workflow structure.

N2  - Proteogenomics combines large-scale genomic and transcriptomic data with mass-spectrometry-based proteomic data to discover novel protein sequence variants and improve genome annotation. In contrast with conventional proteomic applications, proteogenomic analysis requires a number of additional data processing steps. Ideally, these required steps would be integrated and automated via a single software platform offering accessibility for wet-bench researchers as well as flexibility for user-specific customization and integration of new software tools as they emerge. Toward this end, we have extended the Galaxy bioinformatics framework to facilitate proteogenomic analysis. Using analysis of whole human saliva as an example, we demonstrate Galaxys flexibility through the creation of a modular workflow incorporating both established and customized software tools that improve depth and quality of proteogenomic results. Our customized Galaxy-based software includes automated, batch-mode BLASTP searching and a Peptide Sequence Match Evaluator tool, both useful for evaluating the veracity of putative novel peptide identifications. Our complex workflow (approximately 140 steps) can be easily shared using built-in Galaxy functions, enabling their use and customization by others. Our results provide a blueprint for the establishment of the Galaxy framework as an ideal solution for the emerging field of proteogenomics.

N2  - Identifying master regulators of biological processes and mapping their downstream gene networks are key challenges in systems biology. We developed a computational method, called iRegulon, to reverse-engineer the transcriptional regulatory network underlying a co-expressed gene set using cis-regulatory sequence analysis. iRegulon implements a genome-wide ranking-and-recovery approach to detect enriched transcription factor motifs and their optimal sets of direct targets. We increase the accuracy of network inference by using very large motif collections of up to ten thousand position weight matrices collected from various species, and linking these to candidate human TFs via a motif2TF procedure. We validate iRegulon on gene sets derived from ENCODE ChIP-seq data with increasing levels of noise, and we compare iRegulon with existing motif discovery methods. Next, we use iRegulon on more challenging types of gene lists, including microRNA target sets, protein-protein interaction networks, and genetic perturbation data. In particular, we over-activate p53 in breast cancer cells, followed by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, and could identify an extensive up-regulated network controlled directly by p53. Similarly we map a repressive network with no indication of direct p53 regulation but rather an indirect effect via E2F and NFY. Finally, we generalize our computational framework to include regulatory tracks such as ChIP-seq data and show how motif and track discovery can be combined to map functional regulatory interactions among co-expressed genes. iRegulon is available as a Cytoscape plugin from http://iregulon.aertslab.org.

N2  - Cloud computing has become a widely used solution for efficiently provisioning computational and storage resources. Meanwhile, it is essential to provide customizable scientific data analytic platforms for researchers to conduct their personalized data intensive analysis. The integration of scientific data analytics and Cloud computing has the potential to improve resource utilization and facilitate the development of scientific researches. This paper proposes an automatic deployment framework for deploying computing environments on Clouds for every customized scientific data analytics. To achieve customization and deployment functionalities, this framework has two major components: customization service and workspace deployment service. Users are allowed to customize their personalized scientific data analytics and required Cloud resources under the customization service. A workspace language is defined in the workspace deployment service to describe the requirements of computing resources and software tools of a scientific data analytics. Workspace deployment service then adopts Chef to deploy corresponding computing environments on Clouds based on the workspace descriptions. We also implement a system based on this automatic deployment framework and present a RNA-seq analysis use case to demonstrate how this framework and its system can be used in practice.

N2  - Background: Although the costs of next generation sequencing technology have decreased over the past years, there is still a lack of simple-to-use applications, for a comprehensive analysis of RNA sequencing data. There is no one-stop shop for transcriptomic genomics. We have developed MAP-RSeq, a comprehensive computational workflow that can be used for obtaining genomic features from transcriptomic sequencing data, for any genome. Results: For optimization of tools and parameters, MAP-RSeq was validated using both simulated and real datasets. MAP-RSeq workflow consists of six major modules such as alignment of reads, quality assessment of reads, gene expression assessment and exon read counting, identification of expressed single nucleotide variants (SNVs), detection of fusion transcripts, summarization of transcriptomics data and final report. This workflow is available for Human transcriptome analysis and can be easily adapted and used for other genomes. Several clinical and research projects at the Mayo Clinic have applied the MAP-RSeq workflow for RNA-Seq studies. The results from MAP-RSeq have thus far enabled clinicians and researchers to understand the transcriptomic landscape of diseases for better diagnosis and treatment of patients. Conclusions: Our software provides gene counts, exon counts, fusion candidates, expressed single nucleotide variants, mapping statistics, visualizations, and a detailed research data report for RNA-Seq. The workflow can be executed on a standalone virtual machine or on a parallel Sun Grid Engine cluster. The software can be downloaded from http://bioinformaticstools.mayo.edu/research/maprseq/.

N2  - With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), including whole genome sequencing (WGS), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), many biologists and computer scientists are highlighting the urgent need for computing power, storage, and various bioinformatics software for analyzing large quantities of sequence data. Currently, building the computational infrastructure required for massive data processing and providing maintenance services are among the most important tasks. However, technology platforms for handling large amounts of information pose multiple challenges for data access and processing. To overcome these challenges, cloud computing technologies are emerging as a possible infrastructure for tackling the intensive use of computing power and communication resources in NGS data analysis. Thus, in this review, we explain the concepts and key technologies of cloud computing, such as Map and Reduce, and discuss the problem of data transfer. To reveal the performance and usefulness of these technologies, we analyzed NGS data using cloud platforms and compared them with a local cluster. From the benchmark results, we concluded that cloud computing is still more expensive than local cluster, but provides reasonable performance for NGS data analysis with acceptable prices and could be a good alternative to local cluster systems.

N2  - Advances in transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) have revolutionized the way to characterize and quantify transcripts. The breakthroughs in RNA-Seq technologies give rise to the ever-increasing volumes of data, making data processing the bottleneck of transcriptome research. It becomes crucial to develop an efficient analysis pipeline to automate RNA-Seq data analysis. Based on Oshell environment, we present here an ultra-fast and powerful RNA-Seq analysis pipeline for quality control, sequence alignment, variation detection, expression quantification and junction discovery. The pipeline runs on both Linux and Windows operating systems, with either stand-alone or cluster computing environment. Parallel computing is also supported for improved processing speed.

N2  - Even though next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become an invaluable tool in molecular biology, several laboratories with NGS facilities lack trained Bioinformaticians for data analysis. Here, focusing on the variant detection application of NGS analysis, we have developed a fully automated pipeline, namely Variant Discovery and Annotation Tool-Graphical User Interface (VDAP-GUI), which detects and annotates single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions from raw sequence reads. VDAP-GUI consolidates several proven methods in each step such as quality control, trimming, mapping, variant detection and annotation. It supports multiple NGS platforms and has four methodological choices for variant detection. Further, it can re-analyze existing data with alternate thresholds and generates easily interpretable reports in html and tab-delimited formats. Using VDAP-GUI, we have analyzed a publically available human whole-exome sequence dataset. VDAP-GUI is developed using Perl/Tk programming, and is available for free download and use at http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdapgui/.

N2  - Background: High-throughput or next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have become an established and affordable experimental framework in biological and medical sciences for all basic and translational research. Processing and analyzing NGS data is challenging. NGS data are big, heterogeneous, sparse, and error prone. Although a plethora of tools for NGS data analysis has emerged in the past decade, (i) software development is still lagging behind data generation capabilities, and (ii) there is a 'cultural' gap between the end user and the developer. Text: Generic software template libraries specifically developed for NGS can help in dealing with the former problem, whilst coupling template libraries with visual programming may help with the latter. Here we scrutinize the state-of-the-art low-level software libraries implemented specifically for NGS and graphical tools for NGS analytics. An ideal developing environment for NGS should be modular (with a native library interface), scalable in computational methods (i.e. serial, multithread, distributed), transparent (platform-independent), interoperable (with external software interface), and usable (via an intuitive graphical user interface). These characteristics should facilitate both the run of standardized NGS pipelines and the development of new workflows based on technological advancements or users' needs. We discuss in detail the potential of a computational framework blending generic template programming and visual programming that addresses all of the current limitations. Conclusion: In the long term, a proper, well-developed (although not necessarily unique) software framework will bridge the current gap between data generation and hypothesis testing. This will eventually facilitate the development of novel diagnostic tools embedded in routine healthcare.

N2  - Motivation: The growth of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has not only dramatically accelerated the pace of research in the field of genomics, but it has also opened the door to personalized medicine and diagnostics. The resulting flood of data has led to the rapid development of large numbers of bioinformatic tools for data analysis, creating a challenging situation for researchers when choosing and configuring a variety of software for their analysis, and for other researchers trying to replicate their analysis. As NGS technology continues to expand from the research environment into clinical laboratories, the challenges associated with data analysis have the potential to slow the adoption of this technology. Results: Here we discuss the potential of virtual machines (VMs) to be used as a method for sharing entire installations of NGS software (bioinformatic 'pipelines'). VMs are created by programs designed to allow multiple operating systems to co-exist on a single physical machine, and they can be made following the object-oriented paradigm of encapsulating data and methods together. This allows NGS data to be distributed within a VM, along with the pre-configured software for its analysis. Although VMs have historically suffered from poor performance relative to native operating systems, we present benchmarking results demonstrating that this reduced performance can now be minimized. We further discuss the many potential benefits of VMs as a solution for NGS analysis and describe several published examples. Lastly, we consider the benefits of VMs in facilitating the introduction of NGS technology into the clinical environment.

N2  - The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionised the way biologists produce, analyse and interpret data. Although NGS platforms provide a cost-effective way to discover genome-wide variants from a single experiment, variants discovered by NGS need follow up validation due to the high error rates associated with various sequencing chemistries. Recently, whole exome sequencing has been proposed as an affordable option compared to whole genome runs but it still requires follow up validation of all the novel exomic variants. Customarily, a consensus approach is used to overcome the systematic errors inherent to the sequencing technology, alignment and post alignment variant detection algorithms. However, the aforementioned approach warrants the use of multiple sequencing chemistry, multiple alignment tools, multiple variant callers which may not be viable in terms of time and money for individual investigators with limited informatics know-how. Biologists often lack the requisite training to deal with the huge amount of data produced by NGS runs and face difficulty in choosing from the list of freely available analytical tools for NGS data analysis. Hence, there is a need to customise the NGS data analysis pipeline to preferentially retain true variants by minimising the incidence of false positives and make the choice of right analytical tools easier. To this end, we have sampled different freely available tools used at the alignment and post alignment stage suggesting the use of the most suitable combination determined by a simple framework of pre-existing metrics to create significant datasets.

N2  - Background: Probabilistic assignment of ambiguously mapped fragments produced by high-throughput sequencing experiments has been demonstrated to greatly improve accuracy in the analysis of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq, and is an essential step in many other sequence census experiments. A maximum likelihood method using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for optimization is commonly used to solve this problem. However, batch EM-based approaches do not scale well with the size of sequencing datasets, which have been increasing dramatically over the past few years. Thus, current approaches to fragment assignment rely on heuristics or approximations for tractability. Results: We present an implementation of a distributed EM solution to the fragment assignment problem using Spark, a data analytics framework that can scale by leveraging compute clusters within datacenters-"the cloud". We demonstrate that our implementation easily scales to billions of sequenced fragments, while providing the exact maximum likelihood assignment of ambiguous fragments. The accuracy of the method is shown to be an improvement over the most widely used tools available and can be run in a constant amount of time when cluster resources are scaled linearly with the amount of input data. Conclusions: The cloud offers one solution for the difficulties faced in the analysis of massive high-thoughput sequencing data, which continue to grow rapidly. Researchers in bioinformatics must follow developments in distributed systems-such as new frameworks like Spark-for ways to port existing methods to the cloud and help them scale to the datasets of the future.

N2  - Connections between disease phenotypes and drug effects can be made by identifying commonalities in the associated patterns of differential gene expression. Searchable databases that record the impacts of chemical or genetic perturbations on the transcriptome-here referred to as 'connectivity maps'-permit discovery of such commonalities. We describe two R packages, gCMAP and gCMAPWeb, which provide a complete framework to construct and query connectivity maps assembled from user-defined collections of differential gene expression data. Microarray or RNAseq data are processed in a standardized way, and results can be interrogated using various well-established gene set enrichment methods. The packages also feature an easy-to-deploy web application that facilitates reproducible research through automatic generation of graphical and tabular reports.

N2  - Background: The analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) has become a standard task for many laboratories in the life sciences. Though there exists several tools to support users in the manipulation of such datasets on various levels, few are built on the basis of vertical integration. Here, we present the NExt generation Analysis Toolbox (NEAT) that allows non-expert users including wet-lab scientists to comprehensively build, run and analyze NGS data through double-clickable executables without the need of any programming experience. Results: In comparison to many publicly available tools including Galaxy, NEAT provides three main advantages: (1) Through the development of double-clickable executables, NEAT is efficient (completes within <24 hours), easy to implement and intuitive; (2) Storage space, maximum number of job submissions, wall time and cluster-specific parameters can be customized as NEAT is run on the institution's cluster; (3) NEAT allows users to visualize and summarize NGS data rapidly and efficiently using various built-in exploratory data analysis tools including metagenomic and differentially expressed gene analysis. To simplify the control of the workflow, NEAT projects are built around a unique and centralized file containing sample names, replicates, conditions, antibodies, alignment-, filtering-and peak calling parameters as well as cluster-specific paths and settings. Moreover, the small-sized files produced by NEAT allow users to easily manipulate, consolidate and share datasets from different users and institutions. Conclusions: NEAT provides biologists and bioinformaticians with a robust, efficient and comprehensive tool for the analysis of massive NGS datasets. Frameworks such as NEAT not only allow novice users to overcome the increasing number of technical hurdles due to the complexity of manipulating large datasets, but provide more advance users with tools that ensure high reproducibility standards in the NGS era. NEAT is publically available at https://github.com/pschorderet/NEAT.

N2  - Background: Current practice in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is to identify peptides by comparison of experimental mass spectra with theoretical mass spectra derived from a reference protein database; however, this strategy necessarily fails to detect peptide and protein sequences that are absent from the database. We and others have recently shown that customized proteomic databases derived from RNA-Seq data can be employed for MS-searching to both improve MS analysis and identify novel peptides. While this general strategy constitutes a significant advance for the discovery of novel protein variations, it has not been readily transferable to other laboratories due to the need for many specialized software tools. To address this problem, we have implemented readily accessible, modifiable, and extensible workflows within Galaxy-P, short for Galaxy for Proteomics, a web-based bioinformatic extension of the Galaxy framework for the analysis of multi-omics (e. g. genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) data. Results: We present three bioinformatic workflows that allow the user to upload raw RNA sequencing reads and convert the data into high-quality customized proteomic databases suitable for MS searching. We show the utility of these workflows on human and mouse samples, identifying 544 peptides containing single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) and 187 peptides corresponding to unannotated splice junction peptides, correlating protein and transcript expression levels, and providing the option to incorporate transcript abundance measures within the MS database search process (reduced databases, incorporation of transcript abundance for protein identification score calculations, etc.). Conclusions: Using RNA-Seq data to enhance MS analysis is a promising strategy to discover novel peptides specific to a sample and, more generally, to improve proteomics results. The main bottleneck for widespread adoption of this strategy has been the lack of easily used and modifiable computational tools. We provide a solution to this problem by introducing a set of workflows within the Galaxy-P framework that converts raw RNA-Seq data into customized proteomic databases.

N2  - Background: Genome-wide experiments are routinely conducted to measure gene expression, DNA-protein interactions and epigenetic status. Structured metadata for these experiments is imperative for a complete understanding of experimental conditions, to enable consistent data processing and to allow retrieval, comparison, and integration of experimental results. Even though several repositories have been developed for genomics data, only a few provide annotation of samples and assays using controlled vocabularies. Moreover, many of them are tailored for a single type of technology or measurement and do not support the integration of multiple data types. Results: We have developed eXframe - a reusable web-based framework for genomics experiments that provides 1) the ability to publish structured data compliant with accepted standards 2) support for multiple data types including microarrays and next generation sequencing 3) query, analysis and visualization integration tools (enabled by consistent processing of the raw data and annotation of samples) and is available as open-source software. We present two case studies where this software is currently being used to build repositories of genomics experiments - one contains data from hematopoietic stem cells and another from Parkinson's disease patients. Conclusion: The web-based framework eXframe offers structured annotation of experiments as well as uniform processing and storage of molecular data from microarray and next generation sequencing platforms. The framework allows users to query and integrate information across species, technologies, measurement types and experimental conditions. Our framework is reusable and freely modifiable - other groups or institutions can deploy their own custom web-based repositories based on this software. It is interoperable with the most important data formats in this domain. We hope that other groups will not only use eXframe, but also contribute their own useful modifications.

N2  - Sequencing the transcriptome can answer various questions such as determining the transcripts expressed in a given species for a specific tissue or condition, evaluating differential expression, discovering variants, and evaluating allele-specific expression. Differential expression evaluates the expression differences between different strains, tissues, and conditions. Allele-specific expression evaluates expression differences between parental alleles. Both differential expression and allele-specific expression have been studied for heterosis (hybrid vigor), where the hybrid has improved performance over the parents for one or more traits. The Allele Workbench software was developed for a heterosis study that evaluated allele-specific expression for a mouse F1 hybrid using libraries from multiple tissues with biological replicates. This software has been made into a distributable package, which includes a pipeline, a Java interface to build the database, and a Java interface for query and display of the results. The required input is a reference genome, annotation file, and one or more RNA-Seq libraries with optional replicates. It evaluates allelic imbalance at the SNP and transcript level and flags transcripts with significant opposite directional allele-specific expression. The Java interface allows the user to view data from libraries, replicates, genes, transcripts, exons, and variants, including queries on allele imbalance for selected libraries. To determine the impact of allele-specific SNPs on protein folding, variants are annotated with their effect (e.g., missense), and the parental protein sequences may be exported for protein folding analysis. The Allele Workbench processing results in transcript files and read counts that can be used as input to the previously published Transcriptome Computational Workbench, which has a new algorithm for determining a trimmed set of gene ontology terms. The software with demo files is available from https://code.google.com/p/alleleworkbench. Additionally, all software is ready for immediate use from an Atmosphere Virtual Machine Image available from the iPlant Collaborative (www.iplantcollaborative.org).

N2  - Background: Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are indispensable for molecular biology research, but data analysis represents the bottleneck in their application. Users need to be familiar with computer terminal commands, the Linux environment, and various software tools and scripts. Analysis workflows have to be optimized and experimentally validated to extract biologically meaningful data. Moreover, as larger datasets are being generated, their analysis requires use of high-performance servers. Results: To address these needs, we developed CANEapp (application for Comprehensive automated Analysis of Next-generation sequencing Experiments), a unique suite that combines a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and an automated server-side analysis pipeline that is platform-independent, making it suitable for any server architecture. The GUI runs on a PC or Mac and seamlessly connects to the server to provide full GUI control of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) project analysis. The server-side analysis pipeline contains a framework that is implemented on a Linux server through completely automated installation of software components and reference files. Analysis with CANEapp is also fully automated and performs differential gene expression analysis and novel noncoding RNA discovery through alternative workflows (Cuffdiff and R packages edgeR and DESeq2). We compared CANEapp to other similar tools, and it significantly improves on previous developments. We experimentally validated CANEapp's performance by applying it to data derived from different experimental paradigms and confirming the results with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). CANEapp adapts to any server architecture by effectively using available resources and thus handles large amounts of data efficiently. CANEapp performance has been experimentally validated on various biological datasets. CANEapp is available free of charge athttp://psychiatry.med.miami.edu/research/laboratory-of-translational-r na-genomics/CANE-app. Conclusions: We believe that CANEapp will serve both biologists with no computational experience and bioinformaticians as a simple, timesaving but accurate and powerful tool to analyze large RNA-seq datasets and will provide foundations for future development of integrated and automated high-throughput genomics data analysis tools. Due to its inherently standardized pipeline and combination of automated analysis and platform-independence, CANEapp is an ideal for large-scale collaborative RNA-seq projects between different institutions and research groups.

N2  - Background: Technical advances in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) provide a means to acquire deeper insights into cellular functions. The lack of standardized and automated methodologies poses a challenge for the analysis and interpretation of RNA sequencing data. We critically compare and evaluate state-of-the-art bioinformatics approaches and present a workflow that integrates the best performing data analysis, data evaluation and annotation methods in a Transparent, Reproducible and Automated PipeLINE (TRAPLINE) for RNA sequencing data processing (suitable for Illumina, SOLiD and Solexa). Results: Comparative transcriptomics analyses with TRAPLINE result in a set of differentially expressed genes, their corresponding protein-protein interactions, splice variants, promoter activity, predicted miRNA-target interactions and files for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. The obtained results are combined into a single file for downstream analysis such as network construction. We demonstrate the value of the proposed pipeline by characterizing the transcriptome of our recently described stem cell derived antibiotic selected cardiac bodies ('aCaBs'). Conclusion: TRAPLINE supports NGS-based research by providing a workflow that requires no bioinformatics skills, decreases the processing time of the analysis and works in the cloud. The pipeline is implemented in the biomedical research platform Galaxy and is freely accessible via www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/RNAseqTRAPLINE or the specific Galaxy manual page (https://usegalaxy.org/u/mwolfien/p/trapline-manual).

N2  - Background: Several tools have been developed to enable biologists to perform initial browsing and exploration of sequencing data. However the computational tool set for further analyses often requires significant computational expertise to use and many of the biologists with the knowledge needed to interpret these data must rely on programming experts. Results: We present VisRseq, a framework for analysis of sequencing datasets that provides a computationally rich and accessible framework for integrative and interactive analyses without requiring programming expertise. We achieve this aim by providing R apps, which offer a semi-auto generated and unified graphical user interface for computational packages in R and repositories such as Bioconductor. To address the interactivity limitation inherent in R libraries, our framework includes several native apps that provide exploration and brushing operations as well as an integrated genome browser. The apps can be chained together to create more powerful analysis workflows. Conclusions: To validate the usability of VisRseq for analysis of sequencing data, we present two case studies performed by our collaborators and report their workflow and insights.

N2  - Motivation: Data from RNA-seq experiments provide us with many new possibilities to gain insights into biological and disease mechanisms of cellular functioning. However, the reproducibility and robustness of RNA-seq data analysis results is often unclear. This is in part attributed to the two counter acting goals of (i) a cost efficient and (ii) an optimal experimental design leading to a compromise, e.g. in the sequencing depth of experiments. Results: We introduce an R package called samExploreR that allows the subsampling (m out of n bootstraping) of short-reads based on SAM files facilitating the investigation of sequencing depth related questions for the experimental design. Overall, this provides a systematic way for exploring the reproducibility and robustness of general RNA-seq studies. We exemplify the usage of samExploreR by studying the influence of the sequencing depth and the annotation on the identification of differentially expressed genes. © The Author 2016.

N2  - The majority of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) expression studies in plants remain underutilized and inaccessible due to the use of disparate transcriptome references and the lack of skills and resources to analyze and visualize these data. We have developed expVIP, an expression visualization and integration platform, which allows easy analysis of RNA-seq data combined with an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can analyze public and user-specified data sets with minimal bioinformatics knowledge using the expVIP virtual machine. This generates a custom Web browser to visualize, sort, and filter the RNA-seq data and provides outputs for differential gene expression analysis. We demonstrate expVIP’s suitability for polyploid crops and evaluate its performance across a range of biologically relevant scenarios. To exemplify its use in crop research, we developed a flexible wheat (Triticum aestivum) expression browser (www.wheat-expression.com) that can be expanded with user-generated data in a local virtual machine environment. The open-access expVIP platform will facilitate the analysis of gene expression data from a wide variety of species by enabling the easy integration, visualization, and comparison of RNA-seq data across experiments. © 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

N2  - De-novo motif search is a frequently applied bioinformatics procedure to identify and prioritize recurrent elements in sequences sets for biological investigation, such as the ones derived from high-throughput differential expression experiments. Several algorithms have been developed to perform motif search, employing widely different approaches and often giving divergent results. In order to maximize the power of these investigations and ultimately be able to draft solid biological hypotheses, there is the need for applying multiple tools on the same sequences and merge the obtained results. However, motif reporting formats and statistical evaluation methods currently make such an integration task difficult to perform and mostly restricted to specific scenarios. We thus introduce here the Dynamic Motif Integration Toolkit (DynaMIT), an extremely flexible platform allowing to identify motifs employing multiple algorithms, integrate them by means of a user-selected strategy and visualize results in several ways; furthermore, the platform is user-extendible in all its aspects.

N2  - Background: Sequencing technologies provide a wealth of details in terms of genes, expression, splice variants, polymorphisms, and other features. A standard for sequencing analysis pipelines is to put genomic or transcriptomic features into a context of known functional information, but the relationships between ontology terms are often ignored. For RNA-Seq, considering genes and their genetic variants at the group level enables a convenient way to both integrate annotation data and detect small coordinated changes between experimental conditions, a known caveat of gene level analyses. Results: We introduce the high throughput data integration tool, htsint, as an extension to the commonly used gene set enrichment frameworks. The central aim of htsint is to compile annotation information from one or more taxa in order to calculate functional distances among all genes in a specified gene space. Spectral clustering is then used to partition the genes, thereby generating functional modules. The gene space can range from a targeted list of genes, like a specific pathway, all the way to an ensemble of genomes. Given a collection of gene sets and a count matrix of transcriptomic features (e.g. expression, polymorphisms), the gene sets produced by htsint can be tested for 'enrichment' or conditional differences using one of a number of commonly available packages. Conclusion: The database and bundled tools to generate functional modules were designed with sequencing pipelines in mind, but the toolkit nature of htsint allows it to also be used in other areas of genomics. The software is freely available as a Python library through GitHub at https://github.com/ajrichards/htsint. © 2015 Richards et al.

N2  - The iPlant Collaborative is an academic consortium whose mission is to develop an informatics and social infrastructure to address the "grand challenges" in plant biology. Its cyberinfrastructure supports the computational needs of the research community and facilitates solving major challenges in plant science. The Discovery Environment provides a powerful and rich graphical interface to the iPlant Collaborative cyberinfrastructure by creating an accessible virtual workbench that enables all levels of expertise, ranging from students to traditional biology researchers and computational experts, to explore, analyze, and share their data. By providing access to iPlant's robust data-management system and high-performance computing resources, the Discovery Environment also creates a unified space in which researchers can access scalable tools. Researchers can use available Applications (Apps) to execute analyses on their data, as well as customize or integrate their own tools to better meet the specific needs of their research. These Apps can also be used in workflows that automate more complicated analyses. This module describes how to use the main features of the Discovery Environment, using bioinformatics workflows for high-throughput sequence data as examples. © 2013 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
