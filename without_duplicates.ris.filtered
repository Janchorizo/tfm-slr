N2  - Biology research has entered into the big data era. Systems biology approaches, therefore, have become essential tools to elucidate the whole landscape of how cells separate, grow, and resist different stresses. In 2009, a novel RNA technology, termed ribosome profiling, was invented by Dr. JonathanWeissman Lab from UCSF. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) is a powerful tool which can provide the most direct readout of the intracellular translation state of a protein including information on the location of translation start/stop sites, ribosome distribution pattern, and even the moving rate of the translating ribosome, at the whole-genome scale and single-nucleotide resolution. To date, many researchers including our lab have successfully applied ribosome profiling method for diverse purposes. We thus review in this chapter the underlying mechanism and recent advances as regards this fantastic tool. Firstly, we introduce the working mechanism, advantages, and study history of ribosome profiling. Secondly, we discuss the data analysis pipeline, also compare different statistical algorithms and data visualization software. Finally, we review the extensive applications of Ribo-seq, for example, identification of uORF, computation of global translation efficiency (TE), the study of the posttranscriptional regulatory role of RNA binding protein and others. We hope this chapter would be useful for interested systems biology researchers as well as RNA biologists.

N2  - Viruses cause significant yield and quality losses in a wide variety of cultivated crops. Hence, the detection and identification of viruses is a crucial facet of successful crop production and of great significance in terms of world food security. Whilst the adoption of molecular techniques such as RT-PCR has increased the speed and accuracy of viral diagnostics, such techniques only allow the detection of known viruses, i.e., each test is specific to one or a small number of related viruses. Therefore, unknown viruses can be missed and testing can be slow and expensive if molecular tests are unavailable. Methods for simultaneous detection of multiple viruses have been developed, and (NGS) is now a principal focus of this area, as it enables unbiased and hypothesis-free testing of plant samples. The development of NGS protocols capable of detecting multiple known and emergent viruses present in infected material is proving to be a major advance for crops, nuclear stocks or imported plants and germplasm, in which disease symptoms are absent, unspecific or only triggered by multiple viruses. Researchers want to answer the question "how many different viruses are present in this crop plant?" without knowing what they are looking for: RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of plant material allows this question to be addressed. As well as needing efficient nucleic acid extraction and enrichment protocols, virus detection using RNA-seq requires fast and robust bioinformatics methods to enable host sequence removal and virus classification. In this review recent studies that use RNA-seq for virus detection in a variety of crop plants are discussed with specific emphasis on the computational methods implemented. The main features of a number of specific bioinformatics workflows developed for virus detection from NGS data are also outlined and possible reasons why these have not yet been widely adopted are discussed. The review concludes by discussing the future directions of this field, including the use of bioinformatics tools for virus detection deployed in analytical environments using cloud computing.

N2  - Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a class of noncoding RNA > 200 bp in length that has essential roles in regulating a variety of biological processes. Here, we constructed a computational pipeline to identify lncRNA genes in the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), a major insect pest of cruciferous vegetables. In total, 3,324 lncRNAs corresponding to 2,475 loci were identified from 13 RNA-Seq datasets, including samples from parasitized, insecticide-resistant strains and different developmental stages. The identified P. xylostella lncRNAs had shorter transcripts and fewer exons than protein-coding genes. Seven out of nine randomly selected lncRNAs were validated by strand-specific RT-PCR. In total, 54-172 lncRNAs were specifically expressed in the insecticide resistant strains, among which one lncRNA was located adjacent to the sodium channel gene. In addition, 63-135 lncRNAs were specifically expressed in different developmental stages, among which three lncRNAs overlapped or were located adjacent to the metamorphosis-associated genes. These lncRNAs were either strongly or weakly co-expressed with their overlapping or neighboring mRNA genes. In summary, we identified thousands of lncRNAs and presented evidence that lncRNAs might have key roles in conferring insecticide resistance and regulating the metamorphosis development in P. xylostella.

N2  - Background: The chronically instrumented fetal sheep is a widely used animal model to study fetal brain development in health and disease, but no methods exist yet to interrogate dedicated brain cell populations to identify their molecular and genomic phenotype. For example, the molecular mechanisms whereby microglia or astrocytes contribute to inflammation in the brain remain incompletely understood. New method: Here we present a protocol to derive primary pure microglial or astrocyte cultures from near -term fetal sheep brain, after the animals have been chronically instrumented and studied in vivo. Next, we present the implementation of whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) pipeline to deeper elucidate the phenotype of such primary sheep brain glial cultures. Results: We validate the new primary cultures method for cell purity and test the function of the glial cells on protein (IL-1 beta) and transcriptome (RNAseq) levels in response to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in vitro. Comparison with existing methods: This method represents the first implementation of pure microglial or astrocytes cultures in fetal sheep brain. Conclusions: The presented approach opens new possibilities for testing not only supernatant protein levels in response to an in vitro challenge, but also to evaluate changes in the transcriptome of glial cells derived from a large mammalian brain bearing high resemblance to the human brain. Moreover, the presented approach lends itself to modeling the complex multi-hit paradigms of antenatal and perinatal cerebral insults in vivo and in vitro. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - A major goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the role of adaptive processes on sensory systems. Visual capabilities are strongly influenced by environmental and ecological conditions, and the evolutionary advantages of vision are manifest by its complexity and ubiquity throughout Metazoa. Crustaceans occupy a vast array of habitats and ecological niches, and are thus ideal taxa to investigate the evolution of visual systems. A comparative approach is taken here for efficient identification and classification of opsin genes, photoreceptive pigment proteins involved in color vision, focusing on two crustacean model organisms:Hyalella azteca and Daphnia pulex. Transcriptomes of both species were assembled de novo to elucidate the diversity and function of expressed opsins within a robust phylogenetic context. For this purpose, we developed a modified version of the Phylogenetically Informed Annotation tool's pipeline to filter and identify visual genes from transcriptomes in a scalable and efficient manner. In addition, reference genomes of these species were used to validate our pipeline while characterizing the genomic architecture of the opsin genes. Next-generation sequencing and phylogenetics provide future venues for the study of sensory systems, adaptation, and evolution in model and nonmodel organisms.

N2  - A major challenge in analyzing the data from high-throughput next-generation sequencing < NGS > is how to handle the huge amounts of data and variety of NGS tools and visualize the resultant outputs. To address these issues, we developed a cloud-based data analysis platform, Maser < Management and Analysis System for Enormous Reads >, and an original genome browser, Genome Explorer < GE >. Maser enables users to manage up to 2 terabytes of data to conduct analyses with easy graphical user interface operations and offers analysis pipelines in which several individual tools are combined as a single pipeline for very common and standard analyses. GE automatically visualizes genome assembly and mapping results output from Maser pipelines, without requiring additional data upload. With this function, the Maser pipelines can graphically display the results output from all the embedded tools and mapping results in a web browser. Therefore Maser realized a more user-friendly analysis platform especially for beginners by improving graphical display and providing the selected standard pipelines that work with built-in genome browser. In addition, all the analyses executed on Maser are recorded in the analysis history, helping users to trace and repeat the analyses. The entire process of analysis and its histories can be shared with collaborators or opened to the public. In conclusion, our system is useful for managing, analyzing, and visualizing NGS data and achieves traceability, reproducibility, and transparency of NGS analysis.

N2  - Sporulation of budding yeast is a developmental process in which cells undergo meiosis to generate stress-resistant progeny. The dynamic nature of the budding yeast meiotic transcriptome has been well established by a number of genome-wide studies. Here we develop an analysis pipeline to systematically identify novel transcription start sites that reside internal to a gene. Application of this pipeline to data from a synchronized meiotic time course reveals over 40 genes that display specific internal initiations in mid-sporulation. Consistent with the time of induction, motif analysis on upstream sequences of these internal transcription start sites reveals a significant enrichment for the binding site of Ndt80, the transcriptional activator of middle sporulation genes. Further examination of one gene, MRK1, demonstrates the Ndt80 binding site is necessary for internal initiation and results in the expression of an N-terminally truncated protein isoform. When the MRK1 paralog RIM11 is downregulated, the MRK1 internal transcript promotes efficient sporulation, indicating functional significance of the internal initiation. Our findings suggest internal transcriptional initiation to be a dynamic, regulated process with potential functional impacts on development.

N2  - The current DNA sequencing technologies and their high-throughput yield, allowed the thrive of genomic and transcriptomic experiments but it also have generated big data problem. Due to this exponential growth of sequencing data, also the complexity of managing, processing and interpreting it in order to generate results, has raised. Therefore, the demand of easy-to-use friendly software and websites to run bioinformatic tools is imminent. In particular, RNA-Seq and differential expression analysis have become a popular and useful method to evaluate the genetic expression change in any organism. However, many scientists struggle with the data analysis since most of the available tools are implemented in a UNIX-based environment. Therefore, we have developed the web server IDEAMEX (Integrative Differential Expression Analysis for Multiple EXperiments). The IDEAMEX pipeline needs a raw count table for as many desired replicates and conditions, allowing the user to select which conditions will be compared, instead of doing all-vs.-all comparisons. The whole process consists of three main steps (1) Data Analysis: that allows a preliminary analysis for quality control based on the data distribution per sample, using different types of graphs; (2) Differential expression: performs the differential expression analysis with or without batch effect error awareness, using the bioconductor packages, NOISeq, limma-Voom, DESeg2 and edgeR, and generate reports for each method; (3) Result integration: the obtained results the integrated results are reported using different graphical outputs such as correlograms, heatmaps, Venn diagrams and text lists. Our server allows an easy and friendly visualization for results, providing an easy interaction during the analysis process, as well as error tracking and debugging by providing output log files. The server is currently available and can be accessed at http://www.uusmb.unam.mx/ideamex/where the documentation and example input files are provided. We consider that this web server can help other researchers with no previous bioinformatic knowledge, to perform their analyses in a simple manner.

N2  - Next-generation sequencing approaches, in particular RNA-seq, provide a genome-wide expression profiling allowing the identification of novel and rare transcripts such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA). Many RNA-seq studies have now been performed aimed at the characterization of lncRNAs and their possible involvement in cell development and differentiation in different organisms, cell types, and tissues. The adaptive immune system is an extraordinary context for the study of the role of lncRNAs in differentiation. Indeed lncRNAs seem to be key drivers in governing flexibility and plasticity of both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell, together with lineage-specific transcription factors and cytokines, acting as fine-tuners of fate choices in T cell differentiation. We describe here a pipeline for the identification of lncRNAs starting from RNA-Seq raw data.

N2  - Background: Copy number variations (CNVs) are the main genetic structural variations in cancer genome. Detecting CNVs in genetic exome region is efficient and cost-effective in identifying cancer associated genes. Many tools had been developed accordingly and yet these tools lack of reliability because of high false negative rate, which is intrinsically caused by genome exonic bias. Results: To provide an alternative option, here, we report Anaconda, a comprehensive pipeline that allows flexible integration of multiple CNV-calling methods and systematic annotation of CNVs in analyzing WES data. Just by one command, Anaconda can generate CNV detection result by up to four CNV detecting tools. Associated with comprehensive annotation analysis of genes involved in shared CNV regions, Anaconda is able to deliver a more reliable and useful report in assistance with CNV-associate cancer researches.

N2  - Complex behavioral traits, such as alcohol abuse, are caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors, producing deleterious functional adaptations in the central nervous system. The long-term behavioral consequences of such changes are of substantial cost to both the individual and society. Substantial progress has been made in the last two decades in understanding elements of brain mechanisms underlying responses to ethanol in animal models and risk factors for alcohol use disorder(AUD) in humans. However, treatments for AUD remain largely ineffective and few medications for this disease state have been licensed. Genome-wide genetic polymorphism analysis(GWAS) in humans, behavioral genetic studies in animal models and brain gene expression studies produced by microarrays or RNA-seq have the potential to produce nonbiased and novel insight into the underlying neurobiology of AUD. However, the complexity of such information, both statistical and informational, has slowed progress toward identifying new targets for intervention in AUD. This chapter describes one approach for integrating behavioral, genetic, and genomic information across animal model and human studies. The goal of this approach is to identify networks of genes functioning in the brain that are most relevant to the underlying mechanisms of a complex disease such as AUD. We illustrate an example of how genomic studies in animal models can be used to produce robust gene networks that have functional implications, and to integrate such animal model genomic data with human genetic studies such as GWAS for AUD. We describe several useful analysis tools for such studies: ComBAT, WGCNA, and EW_dmGWAS. The end result of this analysis is a ranking of gene networks and identification of their cognate hub genes, which might provide eventual targets for future therapeutic development. Furthermore, this combined approach may also improve our understanding of basic mechanisms underlying gene x environmental interactions affecting brain functioning in health and disease.

N2  - Phylogenomics is extremely powerful but introduces new challenges as no agreement exists on 'standards' for data selection, curation and tree inference. We use jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomata) as a model to address these issues. Despite considerable efforts in resolving their evolutionary history and macroevolution, few studies have included a full phylogenetic diversity of gnathostomes, and some relationships remain controversial. We tested a new bioinformatic pipeline to assemble large and accurate phylogenomic datasets from RNA sequencing and found this phylotranscriptomic approach to be successful and highly cost- effective. Increased sequencing effort up to about 10 Gbp allows more genes to be recovered, but shallower sequencing (1.5 Gbp) is sufficient to obtain thousands of full-length orthologous transcripts. We reconstruct a robust and strongly supported timetree of jawed vertebrates using 7,189 nuclear genes from 100 taxa, including 23 new transcriptomes from previously unsampled key species. Gene jackknifing of genomic data corroborates the robustness of our tree and allows calculating genome-wide divergence times by overcoming gene sampling bias. Mitochondrial genomes prove insufficient to resolve the deepest relationships because of limited signal and among-lineage rate heterogeneity. Our analyses emphasize the importance of large, curated, nuclear datasets to increase the accuracy of phylogenomics and provide a reference framework for the evolutionary history of jawed vertebrates.

N2  - BackgroundHigh-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA metabarcoding) has become a routine tool for biodiversity survey and ecological studies. By including sample-specific tags in the primers prior PCR amplification, it is possible to multiplex hundreds of samples in a single sequencing run. The analysis of millions of sequences spread into hundreds to thousands of samples prompts for efficient, automated yet flexible analysis pipelines. Various algorithms and software have been developed to perform one or multiple processing steps, such as paired-end reads assembly, chimera filtering, Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) clustering and taxonomic assignment. Some of these software are now well established and widely used by scientists as part of their workflow. Wrappers that are capable to process metabarcoding data from raw sequencing data to annotated OTU-to-sample matrix were also developed to facilitate the analysis for non-specialist users. Yet, most of them require basic bioinformatic or command-line knowledge, which can limit the accessibility to such integrative toolkits. Furthermore, for flexibility reasons, these tools have adopted a step-by-step approach, which can prevent an easy automation of the workflow, and hence hamper the analysis reproducibility.ResultsWe introduce SLIM, an open-source web application that simplifies the creation and execution of metabarcoding data processing pipelines through an intuitive Graphic User Interface (GUI). The GUI interact with well-established software and their associated parameters, so that the processing steps are performed seamlessly from the raw sequencing data to an annotated OTU-to-sample matrix. Thanks to a module-centered organization, SLIM can be used for a wide range of metabarcoding cases, and can also be extended by developers for custom needs or for the integration of new software. The pipeline configuration (i.e. the modules chaining and all their parameters) is stored in a file that can be used for reproducing the same analysis.ConclusionThis web application has been designed to be user-friendly for non-specialists yet flexible with advanced settings and extensibility for advanced users and bioinformaticians. The source code along with full documentation is available on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/yoann-dufresne/SLIM) and a demonstration server is accessible through the application website (https://trtcrd.github.io/SLIM/).

N2  - IMPORTANCE Conjunctival melanoma (CM) is a highly aggressive ocular cancer for which treatment options are limited; the molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE To identify the molecular characteristics of CM using next-generation whole-exome sequencing (WES). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Whole-exome sequencing was performed on tumor DNA extracted from the archived specimens of 5 patients with CM who had been treated with surgical excision between 2006 and 2011. These samples were analyzed at a tertiary academic ocular oncology referral center using a customized bioinformatic pipeline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sample analyses were designed to detect driver mutations, chromosome copy number aberrations, and mutation signatures. RESULTS The study's 5 patients ranged in age from 51 to 77 years. Four of the 5 were female, and all were white. Mutations were detected in known oncogenes, including BRAF, NRAS, NF1, EGFR, ALK, TERT, and APC. None of the mutations associated with uveal melanoma were found. All samples demonstrated a C -> T mutation signature typical of UV-induced DNA damage. The most common CNA was a gain in chromosome 6p. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In these 5 patients, WES allowed identification of mutations that can be targeted with therapy and supported the role of UV light in CM pathogenesis. These findings indicate a need for larger studies to evaluate the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value of WES for CM.

N2  - As a revolutionary technology for life sciences, RNA-seq has many applications and the computation pipeline has also many variations. Here, we describe a protocol to perform RNA-seq data analysis where the aim is to identify differentially expressed genes in comparisons of two conditions. The protocol follows the recently published RNA-seq data analysis best practice and applies quality checkpoints throughout the analysis to ensure reliable data interpretation. It is written to help new RNA-seq users to understand the basic steps necessary to analyze an RNA-seq dataset properly. An extension of the protocol has been implemented as automated workflows in the R package ezRun, available also in the data analysis framework SUSHI, for reliable, repeatable, and easily interpretable analysis results.

N2  - In recent years, the publication of genome sequences for the Chinese hamster and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines has facilitated study of these biopharmaceutical cell factories with unprecedented resolution. Our understanding of the CHO cell transcriptome, in particular, has rapidly advanced through the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to characterize RNA expression (RNA-Seq). In this chapter, we present a computational pipeline for the analysis of CHO cell RNA-Seq data from the Illumina platform to identify differentially expressed genes.

N2  - BackgroundA statistical pipeline was developed and used for determining candidate genes and candidate gene coexpression networks involved in 2 alcohol (i.e., ethanol [EtOH]) metabolism phenotypes, namely alcohol clearance and acetate area under the curve in a recombinant inbred (RI) (HXB/BXH) rat panel. The approach was also used to provide an indication of how EtOH metabolism can impact the normal function of the identified networks. MethodsRNA was extracted from alcohol-naive liver tissue of 30 strains of HXB/BXH RI rats. The reconstructed transcripts were quantitated, and data were used to construct gene coexpression modules and networks. A separate group of rats, comprising the same 30 strains, were injected with EtOH (2g/kg) for measurement of blood EtOH and acetate levels. These data were used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of the rate of EtOH disappearance and circulating acetate levels. The analysis pipeline required calculation of the module eigengene values, the correction of these values with EtOH metabolism rates and acetate levels across the rat strains, and the determination of the eigengene QTLs. For a module to be considered a candidate for determining phenotype, the module eigengene values had to have significant correlation with the strain phenotypic values and the module eigengene QTLs had to overlap the phenotypic QTLs. ResultsOf the 658 transcript coexpression modules generated from liver RNA sequencing data, a single module satisfied all criteria for being a candidate for determining the alcohol clearance trait. This module contained 2 alcohol dehydrogenase genes, including the gene whose product was previously shown to be responsible for the majority of alcohol elimination in the rat. This module was also the only module identified as a candidate for influencing circulating acetate levels. This module was also linked to the process of generation and utilization of retinoic acid as related to the autonomous immune response. ConclusionsWe propose that our analytical pipeline can successfully identify genetic regions and transcripts which predispose a particular phenotype and our analysis provides functional context for coexpression module components.

N2  - Sequencing of total RNA enables the study of the whole plant transcriptome resulting from the simultaneous expression of the three genomes of plant cells (located in the nucleus, mitochondrion and chloroplast). While commonly used for the quantification of the nuclear gene expression, this method remains complex and challenging when applied to organellar genomes and/ or when used to quantify posttranscriptional RNA maturations. Here we propose a complete bioinformatical and statistical pipeline to fully characterize the differences in the chloroplast transcriptome between two conditions. Experimental design as well as bioinformatics and statistical analyses are described in order to quantify both gene expression and RNA posttranscriptional maturations, i.e., RNA splicing, editing, and processing, and identify statistically significant differences.

N2  - Octopus-toolkit is a stand-alone application for retrieving and processing large sets of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data with a single step. Octopus-toolkit is an automated set-up-and-analysis pipeline utilizing the Aspera, SRA Toolkit, FastQC, Trimmomatic, HISAT2, STAR, Samtools, and HOMER applications. All the applications are installed on the user's computer when the program starts. Upon the installation, it can automatically retrieve original files of various epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets, including ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, MeDIP-seq, MNase-seq and RNA-seq, from the gene expression omnibus data repository. The downloaded files can then be sequentially processed to generate BAM and BigWig files, which are used for advanced analyses and visualization. Currently, it can process NGS data from popular model genomes such as, human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), dog (Canis lupus familiaris), plant (Arabidopsis thaliana), zebrafish (Danio rerio), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), worm (Caenorhabditis elegans), and budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genomes. With the processed files from Octopus-toolkit, the meta-analysis of various data sets, motif searches for DNA-binding proteins, and the identification of differentially expressed genes and/or protein-binding sites can be easily conducted with few commands by users. Overall, Octopus-toolkit facilitates the systematic and integrative analysis of available epigenomic and transcriptomic NGS big data.

N2  - Background: Soft tissue and bone sarcoma represent a broad spectrum of different pathology and genetic variance. Current chemotherapy regimens are derived from randomised trials and represent empirical treatment. Chemosensitivity testing and whole exome sequencing (WES) may offer personalized chemotherapy treatment based on genetic mutations. Methods: A pilot, prospective, non-randomised control experimental study was conducted. Twelve patients with metastatic bone or soft tissue sarcoma that had failed first line chemotherapy treatment were enrolled for this study. Human tissue taken at surgical biopsy under general anaesthetic was divided between two arms of the trial. Subsections of the tumour were used for WES and the remainder was implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice (PDX). Results of WES were analysed using a bioinformatics pipeline to identify mutations conferring susceptibility to kinase inhibitors and common chemotherapeutic agents. PDX models exhibiting successful growth underwent WES of the tumour and subsequent chemosensitivity testing. Results: WES was successful in all 12 patients, with successful establishment PDX tumours models in seven patients. WES identified potential actionable therapeutics in all patients. Significant variation in predicted therapeutics was demonstrated between three PDX samples and their matched tumour samples. Conclusion: Analysis of WES of fresh tumour specimens via a bioinformatics pipeline may identify potential actionable chemotherapy agents. Further research into this field may lead to the development of personalized cancer therapy for sarcoma.

N2  - Background: Gene prediction is one of the most important steps in the genome annotation process. A large number of software tools and pipelines developed by various computing techniques are available for gene prediction. However, these systems have yet to accurately predict all or even most of the protein-coding regions. Furthermore, none of the currently available gene-finders has a universal Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that can perform gene prediction for all organisms equally well in an automatic fashion. Results: We present an automated gene prediction pipeline, Seqping that uses self-training HMM models and transcriptomic data. The pipeline processes the genome and transcriptome sequences of the target species using GlimmerHMM, SNAP, and AUGUSTUS pipelines, followed by MAKER2 program to combine predictions from the three tools in association with the transcriptomic evidence. Seqping generates species-specific HMMs that are able to offer unbiased gene predictions. The pipeline was evaluated using the Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana genomes. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis showed that the pipeline was able to identify at least 95% of BUSCO's plantae dataset. Our evaluation shows that Seqping was able to generate better gene predictions compared to three HMM-based programs (MAKER2, GlimmerHMM and AUGUSTUS) using their respective available HMMs. Seqping had the highest accuracy in rice (0.5648 for CDS, 0.4468 for exon, and 0.6695 nucleotide structure) and A. thaliana (0.5808 for CDS, 0.5955 for exon, and 0.8839 nucleotide structure). Conclusions: Seqping provides researchers a seamless pipeline to train species-specific HMMs and predict genes in newly sequenced or less-studied genomes. We conclude that the Seqping pipeline predictions are more accurate than gene predictions using the other three approaches with the default or available HMMs.

N2  - Identification of viral integration sites has been important in understanding the pathogenesis and progression of diseases associated with particular viral infections. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled researchers to understand the impact that viral integration has on the host, such as tumorigenesis. Current computational methods to analyze NGS data of virus-host junction sites have been limited in terms of their accessibility to a broad user base. In this study, we developed a software application (named ChimericSeq), that is the first program of its kind to offer a graphical user interface, compatibility with both Windows and Mac operating systems, and optimized for effectively identifying and annotating virus-host chimeric reads within NGS data. In addition, ChimericSeq's pipeline implements custom filtering to remove artifacts and detect reads with quantitative analytical reporting to provide functional significance to discovered integration sites. The improved accessibility of ChimericSeq through a GUI interface in both Windows and Mac has potential to expand NGS analytical support to a broader spectrum of the scientific community.

N2  - Background: Genome-wide miRNA expression data can be used to study miRNA dysregulation comprehensively. Although many open-source tools for microRNA (miRNA)-seq data analyses are available, challenges remain in accurate miRNA quantification from large-scale miRNA-seq dataset. We implemented a pipeline called QuickMIRSeq for accurate quantification of known miRNAs and miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) from multiple samples simultaneously. Results: QuickMIRSeq considers the unique nature of miRNAs and combines many important features into its implementation. First, it takes advantage of high redundancy of miRNA reads and introduces joint mapping of multiple samples to reduce computational time. Second, it incorporates the strand information in the alignment step for more accurate quantification. Third, reads potentially arising from background noise are filtered out to improve the reliability of miRNA detection. Fourth, sequences aligned to miRNAs with mismatches are remapped to a reference genome to further reduce false positives. Finally, QuickMIRSeq generates a rich set of QC metrics and publication-ready plots. Conclusions: The rich visualization features implemented allow end users to interactively explore the results and gain more insights into miRNA-seq data analyses. The high degree of automation and interactivity in QuickMIRSeq leads to a substantial reduction in the time and effort required for miRNA-seq data analysis.

N2  - Understanding the role of short-interfering RNA (siRNA) in diverse biological processes is of current interest and often approached through small RNA sequencing. However, analysis of these datasets is difficult due to the complexity of biological RNA processing pathways, which differ between species. Several properties like strand specificity, length distribution, and distribution of soft-dipped bases are few parameters known to guide researchers in understanding the role of siRNAs. We present RAPID, a generic eukaryotic siRNA analysis pipeline, which captures information inherent in the datasets and automatically produces numerous visualizations as user-friendly HTML reports, covering multiple categories required for siRNA analysis. RAPID also facilitates an automated comparison of multiple datasets, with one of the normalization techniques dedicated for siRNA knockdown analysis, and integrates differential expression analysis using DESeq2.

N2  - An estimated 17% of cancers worldwide are associated with infectious causes. The extent and biological significance of viral presence/infection in actual tumor samples is generally unknown but could be measured using human transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from tumor samples. We present an open source bioinformatics pipeline viGEN, which allows for not only the detection and quantification of viral RNA, but also variants in the viral transcripts. The pipeline includes 4 major modules: The first module aligns and filter out human RNA sequences; the second module maps and count (remaining un-aligned) reads against reference genomes of all known and sequenced human viruses; the third module quantifies read counts at the individual viral-gene level thus allowing for downstream differential expression analysis of viral genes between case and controls groups. The fourth module calls variants in these viruses. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available pipelines or packages that would provide this type of complete analysis in one open source package. In this paper, we applied the viGEN pipeline to two case studies. We first demonstrate the working of our pipeline on a large public dataset, the TOGA cervical cancer cohort. In the second case study, we performed an in-depth analysis on a small focused study of TOGA liver cancer patients. In the latter cohort, we performed viral-gene quantification, viral-variant extraction and survival analysis. This allowed us to find differentially expressed viral-transcripts and viral-variants between the groups of patients, and connect them to clinical outcome. From our analyses, we show that we were able to successfully detect the human papilloma virus among the TOGA cervical cancer patients. We compared the viGEN pipeline with two metagenomics tools and demonstrate similar sensitivity/specificity. We were also able to quantify viral-transcripts and extract viral-variants using the liver cancer dataset. The results presented corresponded with published literature in terms of rate of detection, and impact of several known variants of HBV genome. This pipeline is generalizable, and can be used to provide novel biological insights into microbial infections in complex diseases and tumorigeneses. Our viral pipeline could be used in conjunction with additional type of immuno-oncology analysis based on RNA-seq data of host RNA for cancer immunology applications. The source code, with example data and tutorial is available at: https://github.com/ICBI/viGEN/.

N2  - Next-generation sequencing is empowering genetic disease research. However, it also brings significant challenges for efficient and effective sequencing data analysis. We built a pipeline, called DNAp, for analyzing whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, to detect mutations from disease samples. The pipeline is containerized, convenient to use and can run under any system, since it is a fully automatic process in Docker container form. It is also open, and can be easily customized with user intervention points, such as for updating reference files and different software or versions. The pipeline has been tested with both human and mouse sequencing datasets, and it has generated mutations results, comparable to published results from these datasets, and reproducible across heterogeneous hardware platforms. The pipeline DNAp, funded by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was developed for analyzing DNA sequencing data of FDA. Here we make DNAp an open source, with the software and documentation available to the public at http://bioinformatics.astate.edu/dna-pipeline/.

N2  - Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences which are capable of moving from one location to another and represent a large proportion (45%) of the human genome. TEs have functional roles in a variety of biological phenomena such as cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and aging. Rapid development in RNA-sequencing technology has enabled us, for the first time, to study the activity of TE at the systems level. However, efficient TE analysis tools are not yet developed. In this work, we developed SalmonTE, a fast and reliable pipeline for the quantification of TEs from RNA-seq data. We benchmarked our tool against TEtranscripts, a widely used TE quantification method, and three other quantification methods using several RNA-seq datasets from Drosophila melanogaster and human cell-line. We achieved 20 times faster execution speed without compromising the accuracy. This pipeline will enable the biomedical research community to quantify and analyze TEs from large amounts of data and lead to novel TE centric discoveries.

N2  - Since its first use in plants in 2007, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has generated a vast amount of data for both model and nonmodel species. Organellar transcriptomes, however, are virtually always overlooked at the data analysis step. We therefore developed ChloroSeq, a bioinformatic pipeline aimed at facilitating the systematic analysis of chloroplast RNA metabolism, and we provide here a step-by--step user's manual. Following the alignment of quality-controlled data to the genome of interest, ChloroSeq measures genome expression level along with splicing and RNA editing efficiencies. When used in combination with the Tuxedo suite (TopHat and Cufflinks), ChloroSeq allows the simultaneous analysis of organellar and nuclear transcriptomes, opening the way to a better understanding of nucleus-organelle cross talk. We also describe the use of R commands to produce publication-quality figures based on ChloroSeq outputs. The effectiveness of the pipeline is illustrated through analysis of an RNA-Seq dataset covering the transition from growth to maturation to senescence of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves.

N2  - Genome-scale single-cell biology has recently emerged as a powerful technology with important implications for both basic and medical research. There are urgent needs for the development of computational methods or analytic pipelines to facilitate large amounts of single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis. Here, we present a detailed protocol for SINCERA (SINgle CEll RNA-Seq profiling Analysis), a generally applicable analytic pipeline for processing single-cell data from a whole organ or sorted cells. The pipeline supports the analysis for the identification of major cell types, cell type-specific gene signatures, and driving forces of given cell types. In this chapter, we provide step-by-step instructions for the functions and features of SINCERA together with application examples to provide a practical guide for the research community. SINCERA is implemented in R, licensed under the GNU General Public License v3, and freely available from CCHMC PBGE website, https://research.cchmc.org/pbge/sincera.html.

N2  - Advancing the clinical utility of whole-exome sequencing (WES) for patients with suspected genetic disorders is largely driven by bioinformatics approaches that streamline data processing and analysis. Herein, we describe our experience with implementing a semiautomated and phenotype-driven WES diagnostic workflow, incorporating both the DRAGEN pipeline and the Exomiser variant prioritization tool, at an academic children's hospital with an ethnically diverse pediatric patient population. We achieved a 41% molecular diagnostic rate for 66 duo-, quad-, or trio-WES cases, and 28% for 40 singleton-WES cases. Preliminary results were returned to ordering physicians within 1 wk for 12 of 38 (32%) probands with positive findings, which were instrumental in guiding the appropriate clinical management for a variety of patients, especially in critical care settings. The semiautomated and streamlined WES workflow also enabled us to identify novel variants in candidate disease genes in patients with developmental delay and autism and immune disorders and cancer, including ANK2, BPTF, BCL11A, FOXN1, PLAA, ATRX, DNAJC21, and RAD50. Together, we demonstrated the implementation of a streamlined WES workflow that was successfully applied for both clinical and research purposes.

N2  - Proper control of microRNA (miRNA) expression is critical for normal development and physiology, while abnormal miRNA expression is a common feature of many diseases. Dissecting mechanisms of miRNA regulation, however, is complicated by the generally poor annotation of miRNA primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). Although some miRNAs are processed from well-defined protein coding genes, the majority of pri-miRNAs are poorly characterized noncoding RNAs, with incomplete annotation of promoters, splice sites, and polyadenylation signals. Due to the efficiency of DROSHA processing, the abundance of pri-miRNAs is very low at steady state, thereby complicating the elucidation of pri-miRNA structures. Here we describe a strategy to enrich intact pri-miRNAs and improve their coverage in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments. In addition, we outline a computational approach for reconstruction of pri-miRNA structures. This pipeline begins with raw RNA-seq reads and concludes with publication-ready visualization of pri-miRNA annotations. Together, these approaches allow the user to define and explore miRNA gene structures in a cell-type or organism of interest.

N2  - Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a well-known small RNA (sRNA) species with important regulatory roles. To date, several bioinformatics tools have been developed for large-scale prediction of miRNAs based on high-throughput sequencing data. However, some of these tools become invalid without reference genomes, while some tools cannot supply user-friendly outputs. Besides, most of the current tools focus on the importance of secondary structures and sRNA expression patterns for miRNA prediction, while they do not pay attention to miRNA processing for reliability check. Results: Here, we reported a pipeline PmiRDiscVali for plant miRNA discovery and partial validation. This pipeline integrated the popular tool miRDeep-P for plant miRNA prediction, making PmiRDiscVali compatible for both reference-based and de novo predictions. To check the prediction reliability, we adopted the concept that the miRNA processing intermediates could be tracked by degradome sequencing (degradome-seq) during the development of PmiRDiscVali. A case study was performed by using the public sequencing data of Dendrobium officinale, in order to show the clear and concise presentation of the prediction results. Conclusion: Summarily, the integrated pipeline PmiRDiscVali, featured with degradome-seq data-based validation and vivid result presentation, should be useful for large-scale identification of plant miRNA candidates.

N2  - Next generation sequencing of the RNA content of single cells or single nuclei (sc/nRNA-seq) has become a powerful approach to understand the cellular complexity and diversity of multicellular organisms and environmental ecosystems. However, the fact that the procedure begins with a relatively small amount of starting material, thereby pushing the limits of the laboratory procedures required, dictates that careful approaches for sample quality control (QC) are essential to reduce the impact of technical noise and sample bias in downstream analysis applications. Here we present a preliminary framework for sample level quality control that is based on the collection of a series of quantitative laboratory and data metrics that are used as features for the construction of QC classification models using random forest machine learning approaches. We've applied this initial framework to a dataset comprised of 2272 single nuclei RNA-seq results and determined that similar to 79% of samples were of high quality. Removal of the poor quality samples from downstream analysis was found to improve the cell type clustering results. In addition, this approach identified quantitative features related to the proportion of unique or duplicate reads and the proportion of reads remaining after quality trimming as useful features for pass/fail classification. The construction and use of classification models for the identification of poor quality samples provides for an objective and scalable approach to sc/nRNA-seq quality control.

N2  - Plant transcription factors have potential to behave as hubs in gene regulatory networks through altering the expression of many downstream genes, and identification of such hub transcription factors strongly enhances our understating of biological processes. Transcriptome analysis has become a staple of gene expression analyses. In addition to current advances in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, various methods for mRNA library construction and downstream data analyses have been enthusiastically developed. Here, we describe Breath Adapter Directional sequencing (BrAD-seq), a simple strand-specific mRNA library preparation for the Illumina platform, allowing easy scaling of transcriptome experiments with low reagent and labor costs. This protocol includes our recent modifications and the detailed practical procedure for BrAD-seq. Because extracting biological meanings from large-scale transcriptome data presents a significant challenge, we also describe a new analytical method that goes beyond differential expression. Differential regulatory analysis (DRA) is based on a gene co-expression network to address which regulatory factor or factors have the ability to predict the abundance of differentially expressed genes between two groups or conditions. This protocol provides a ready-to-use informatics pipeline from raw sequence data to DRA for plant transcriptome datasets.

N2  - The improvement of sequencing technologies has facilitated generalization of metagenomic sequencing, which has become a standard procedure for analyzing the structure and functionality of microbiomes. Bioinformatic analysis of sequencing results poses a challenge because it involves many different complex steps. SqueezeMeta is a fully automatic pipeline for metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, covering all steps of the analysis. SqueezeMeta includes multi-metagenome support that enables co-assembly of related metagenomes and retrieval of individual genomes via binning procedures. SqueezeMeta features several unique characteristics: co-assembly procedure or coassembly of unlimited number of metagenomes via merging of individual assembled metagenomes, both with read mapping for estimation of the abundances of genes in each metagenome. It also includes binning and bin checking for retrieving individual genomes. Internal checks for the assembly and binning steps provide information about the consistency of contigs and bins. Moreover, results are stored in a MySQL database, where they can be easily exported and shared, and can be inspected anywhere using a flexible web interface that allows simple creation of complex queries. We illustrate the potential of SqueezeMeta by analyzing 32 gut metagenomes in a fully automatic way, enabling retrieval of several million genes and several hundreds of genomic bins. One of the motivations in the development of SqueezeMeta was producing a software capable of running in small desktop computers and thus amenable to all users and settings. We were also able to co-assemble two of these metagenomes and complete the full analysis in less than one day using a simple laptop computer. This reveals the capacity of SqueezeMeta to run without high-performance computing infrastructure and in absence of any network connectivity. It is therefore adequate for in situ, real time analysis of metagenomes produced by nanopore sequencing. SqueezeMeta can be downloaded from https://github.com/jtamames/SqueezeMeta.

N2  - Background: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments typically analyze hundreds or thousands of cells after amplification of the cDNA. The high throughput is made possible by the early introduction of sample-specific bar codes (BCs), and the amplification bias is alleviated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Thus, the ideal analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data needs to efficiently tabulate reads according to both BC and UMI. Findings: zUMIs is a pipeline that can handle both known and random BCs and also efficiently collapse UMIs, either just for exon mapping reads or for both exon and intron mapping reads. If BC annotation is missing, zUMIs can accurately detect intact cells from the distribution of sequencing reads. Another unique feature of zUMIs is the adaptive downsampling function that facilitates dealing with hugely varying library sizes but also allows the user to evaluate whether the library has been sequenced to saturation. To illustrate the utility of zUMIs, we analyzed a single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset and show that more than 35% of all reads map to introns. Also, we show that these intronic reads are informative about expression levels, significantly increasing the number of detected genes and improving the cluster resolution. Conclusions: zUMIs flexibility makes if possible to accommodate data generated with any of the major scRNA-seq protocols that use BCs and UMIs and is the most feature-rich, fast, and user-friendly pipeline to process such scRNA-seq data.

N2  - The recent availability of comprehensive, brain-wide gene expression atlases such as the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) has opened new opportunities for understanding how spatial variations on molecular scale relate to the macroscopic neuroimaging phenotypes. A rapidly growing body of literature is demonstrating relationships between gene expression and diverse properties of brain structure and function, but approaches for combining expression atlas data with neuroimaging are highly inconsistent, with substantial variations in how the expression data are processed. The degree to which these methodological variations affect findings is unclear. Here, we outline a seven-step analysis pipeline for relating brain-wide transcriptomic and neuroimaging data and compare how different processing choices influence the resulting data. We suggest that studies using the AHBA should work towards a unified data processing pipeline to ensure consistent and reproducible results in this burgeoning field.

Here we assemble a workflow of the RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analyses for the chicken studies using chicken skin appendage tissue as an example. We present guidelines for RNA-Seq quality control, alignment, quantification, normalization, and differentially expressed gene analysis. In the meantime, we outline a bioinformatics pipeline for ChIP-Seq quality control, alignment, peak calling, super-enhancer identification, and differential enrichment analysis.

N2  - Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed male cancer in the world. The molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression are still unclear. Here we show analysis of a prostate cancer RNA-sequencing dataset that was originally generated by Ren et al. [3] from the prostate tumor and adjacent normal tissues of 14 patients. The data presented here was analyzed using our RNA-sequencing bioinformatics analysis pipeline implemented on the bioinformatics web platform, Galaxy. The relative expression of fibronectin (FN1) and the androgen receptor (AR) were calculated in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads, and represented in FPKM unit. A subanalysis is also shown for data from three patients, that includes the relative expression of FN1 and AR and their fold change. For interpretation and discussion, please refer to the article, "miR-1207-3p regulates the androgen receptor in prostate cancer via FNDC1/fibronectin" [1] by Das et al. (C) 2017 The Authors.

N2  - The advent of next-generation sequencing has resulted in transcriptome-based approaches to investigate functionally significant biological components in a variety of non-model organism. This has resulted in the area of "venomics": a rapidly growing field using combined transcriptomic and proteomic datasets to characterize toxin diversity in a variety of venomous taxa. Ultimately, the transcriptomic portion of these analyses follows very similar pathways after transcriptome assembly often including candidate toxin identification using BLAST, expression level screening, protein sequence alignment, gene tree reconstruction, and characterization of potential toxin function. Here we describe the Python package Venomix, which streamlines these processes using common bioinformatic tools along with ToxProt, a publicly available annotated database comprised of characterized venom proteins. In this study, we use the Venomix pipeline to characterize candidate venom diversity in four phylogenetically distinct organisms, a cone snail (Conidae; Conus sponsalis), a snake (Viperidae; Echis coloratus), an ant (Formicidae; Tetramorium bicarinatum), and a scorpion (Scorpionidae; Urodacus yaschenkoi). Data on these organisms were sampled from public databases, with each original analysis using different approaches for transcriptome assembly, toxin identification, or gene expression quantification, Venomix recovered numerically more candidate toxin transcripts for three of the four transcriptomes than the original analyses and identified new toxin candidates. In summary, we show that the Venomix package is a useful tool to identify and characterize the diversity of toxin-like transcripts derived from transcriptomic datasets.

N2  - Sequencing of transcribed RNA molecules (RNA-Seq) has been used wildly for studying cell transcriptomes in bulk or at the single-cell level (Wang et al., Nat Rev Genet, 10:57-63, 2009; Ozsolak and Milos, Nat Rev Genet, 12:87-98, 2011; Sandberg, Nat Methods, 11:22-24, 2014) and is becoming the de facto technology for investigating gene expression level changes in various biological conditions, on the time course, and under drug treatments. Furthermore, RNA-Seq data helped identify fusion genes that are related to certain cancers (Maher et al., Nature, 458:97-101, 2009). Differential gene expression before and after drug treatments provides insights to mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics of the drugs, and safety concerns (Dixit et al., Genomics, 107:178-188, 2016). Because each RNA-Seq run generates tens to hundreds of millions of short reads with size ranging from 50 to 200 bp, a tool that deciphers these short reads to an integrated and digestible analysis report is in high demand. QuickRNASeq (Zhao et al., BMC Genomics, 17:39-53, 2016) is an application for large-scale RNA-Seq data analysis and real-time interactive visualization of complex data sets. This application automates the use of several of the best open-source tools to efficiently generate user friendly, easy to share, and ready to publish report. Figures in this protocol illustrate some of the interactive plots produced by QuickRNASeq. The visualization features of the application have been further improved since its first publication in early 2016. The original QuickRNASeq publication (Zhao et al., BMC Genomics, 17:39-53, 2016) provided details of background, software selection, and implementation. Here, we outline the steps required to implement QuickRNASeq in user's own environment, as well as demonstrate some basic yet powerful utilities of the advanced interactive visualization modules in the report.

N2  - RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) function in all aspects of RNA processes including stability, structure, export, localization and translation, and control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. To investigate the roles of RBPs and their direct RNA ligands in vivo, recent global approaches combining RNA immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (RIP-seq) as well as UV-cross-linking (CLIP-seq) have become instrumental in dissecting RNA-protein interactions. However, the computational analysis of these high-throughput sequencing data is still challenging. Here, we provide a computational pipeline to analyze CLIP-seq and RIP-seq datasets. This generic analytic procedure may help accelerate the identification of direct RNA-protein interactions from high-throughput RBP profiling experiments in a variety of bacterial species.

N2  - RNA-based regulation has become a major research topic inmolecular biology. The analysis of epigenetic and expression data is therefore incomplete if RNA-based regulation is not taken into account. Thus, it is increasingly important but not yet standard to combine RNA-centric data and analysis tools with other types of experimental data such as RNA-seq or ChIP-seq. Here, we present the RNA workbench, a comprehensive set of analysis tools and consolidated workflows that enable the researcher to combine these two worlds. Based on the Galaxy framework the workbench guarantees simple access, easy extension, flexible adaption to personal and security needs, and sophisticated analyses that are independent of command-line knowledge. Currently, it includes more than 50 bioinformatics tools that are dedicated to different research areas of RNA biology including RNA structure analysis, RNA alignment, RNA annotation, RNA-protein interaction, ribosome profiling, RNA-seq analysis and RNA target prediction. The workbench is developed and maintained by experts in RNA bioinformatics and the Galaxy framework. Together with the growing community evolving around this workbench, we are committed to keep the workbench up-to-date for future standards and needs, providing researchers with a reliable and robust framework for RNA data analysis. Availability: The RNA workbench is available at https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench.

N2  - Motivation: Next-generation sequencing is now an established method in genomics, and massive amounts of sequencing data are being generated on a regular basis. Analysis of the sequencing data is typically performed by lab-specific in-house solutions, but the agreement of results from different facilities is often small. General standards for quality control, reproducibility and documentation are missing. Results: We developed NGS-pipe, a flexible, transparent and easy-to-use framework for the design of pipelines to analyze whole-exome, whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing data. NGSpipe facilitates the harmonization of genomic data analysis by supporting quality control, documentation, reproducibility, parallelization and easy adaptation to other NGS experiments.

N2  - An increasing number of single cell transcriptome and epigenome technologies, including single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq), have been recently developed as powerful tools to analyze the features of many individual cells simultaneously. However, the methods and software were designed for one certain data type and only for single cell transcriptome data. A systematic approach for epigenome data and multiple types of transcriptome data is needed to control data quality and to perform cell-to-cell heterogeneity analysis on these ultra-high-dimensional transcriptome and epigenome datasets. Here we developed Dr. seq2, a Quality Control (QC) and analysis pipeline for multiple types of single cell transcriptome and epigenome data, including scATAC-seq and Drop-ChIP data. Application of this pipeline provides four groups of QC measurements and different analyses, including cell heterogeneity analysis. Dr. seq2 produced reliable results on published single cell transcriptome and epigenome datasets. Overall, Dr. seq2 is a systematic and comprehensive QC and analysis pipeline designed for parallel single cell transcriptome and epigenome data.

N2  - Introduction: The emergence and mass utilization of high-throughput (HT) technologies, including sequencing technologies (genomics) and mass spectrometry (proteomics, metabolomics, lipids), has allowed geneticists, biologists, and biostatisticians to bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype on a massive scale. These new technologies have brought rapid advances in our understanding of cell biology, evolutionary history, microbial environments, and are increasingly providing new insights and applications towards clinical care and personalized medicine.Areas covered: The very success of this industry also translates into daunting big data challenges for researchers and institutions that extend beyond the traditional academic focus of algorithms and tools. The main obstacles revolve around analysis provenance, data management of massive datasets, ease of use of software, interpretability and reproducibility of results.Expert commentary: The authors review the challenges associated with implementing bioinformatics best practices in a large-scale setting, and highlight the opportunity for establishing bioinformatics pipelines that incorporate data tracking and auditing, enabling greater consistency and reproducibility for basic research, translational or clinical settings.

N2  - High-throughput next-generation sequencing is a powerful tool to identify the genotypic landscapes of somatic variants and therapeutic targets in various cancers including gastric cancer, forming the basis for personalized medicine in the clinical setting. Although the advent of many computational algorithms leads to higher accuracy in somatic variant calling, no standard method exists due to the limitations of each method. Here, we constructed a new pipeline. We combined two different somatic variant callers with different algorithms, Strelka and VarScan 2, and evaluated performance using whole exome sequencing data obtained from 19 Japanese cases with gastric cancer (GC); then, we characterized these tumors based on identified driver molecular alterations. More single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions were detected by Strelka and VarScan 2, respectively. SNVs detected by both tools showed higher accuracy for estimating somatic variants compared with those detected by only one of the two tools and accurately showed the mutation signature and mutations of driver genes reported for GC. Our combinatorial pipeline may have an advantage in detection of somatic mutations in GC and may be useful for further genomic characterization of Japanese patients with GC to improve the efficacy of GC treatments. © 2017, University of Tokushima.

N2  - Rapid advancements in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, coupled with the dramatic decrease in cost, have made NGS one of the leading approaches applied in cancer research. In addition, it is increasingly used in clinical practice for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Somatic (cancer-only) single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions (indels) are the simplest classes of mutation, however, their identifcation in whole exome sequencing data is complicated by germline polymorphisms, tumor heterogeneity and errors in sequencing and analysis. An increasing number of software and methodological guidelines are being published for the analysis of sequencing data. Usually, the algorithms of MuTect, VarScan and Genome Analysis Toolkit are applied to identify the variants. However, one of these algorithms alone results in incomplete genomic information. To address this issue, the present study developed a systematic pipeline for analyzing the whole exome sequencing data of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a combination of the three algorithms, named the three-caller pipeline. Application of the three-caller pipeline to the whole exome data of HCC, improved the detection of true positive mutations and a total of 75 tumor-specifc somatic variants were identifed. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the mutations in the genes encoding cell adhesion and regulation of Ras GTPase activity. This pipeline provides an effective approach to identify variants from NGS data for subsequent functional analyses.

N2  - Intermolecular interactions of ncRNAs are at the core of gene regulation events, and identifying the full map of these interactions bears crucial importance for ncRNA functional studies. It is known that RNA- RNA interactions are built up by complementary base pairings between interacting RNAs and high level of complementarity between two RNA sequences is a powerful predictor of such interactions. Here, we present RIsearch2, a large-scale RNA-RNA interaction prediction tool that enables quick localization of potential near-complementary RNA-RNA interactions between given query and target sequences. In contrast to previous heuristics which either search for exact matches while including G-U wobble pairs or employ simplified energy models, we present a novel approach using a single integrated seed-andextend framework based on suffix arrays. RIsearch2 enables fast discovery of candidate RNA-RNA interactions on genome/transcriptome-wide scale. We furthermore present an siRNA off-target discovery pipeline that not only predicts the off-target transcripts but also computes the off-targeting potential of a given siRNA. This is achieved by combining genome-wide RIsearch2 predictions with target site accessibilities and transcript abundance estimates. We show that this pipeline accurately predicts siRNA off-target interactions and enables offtargeting potential comparisons between different siRNA designs. RIsearch2 and the siRNA off-target discovery pipeline are available as stand-alone software packages from http://rth.dk/resources/risearch. © The Author(s) 2017.

N2  - The recently introduced Kallisto pseudoaligner has radically simplified the quantification of transcripts in RNA-sequencing experiments. We offer cloud-scale RNAseq pipelines Arkas-Quantification, which deploys Kallisto for parallel cloud computations, and Arkas-Analysis, which annotates the Kallisto results by extracting structured information directly from source FASTA files with per-contig metadata and calculates the differential expression and gene-set enrichment analysis on both coding genes and transcripts. The biologically informative downstream gene-set analysis maintains special focus on Reactome annotations while supporting ENSEMBL transcriptomes. The Arkas cloud quantification pipeline includes support for custom user-uploaded FASTA files, selection for bias correction and pseudoBAM output. The option to retain pseudoBAM output for structural variant detection and annotation provides a middle ground between de novo transcriptome assembly and routine quantification, while consuming a fraction of the resources used by popular fusion detection pipelines. Illumina's BaseSpace cloud computing environment, where these two applications are hosted, offers a massively parallel distributive quantification step for users where investigators are better served by cloud-based computing platforms due to inherent efficiencies of scale. © 2017 Colombo AR et al.

N2  - Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a very valuable resource to understand the evolutionary history of poorly known species. However, in organisms with large genomes, as most amphibians, WGS is still excessively challenging and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) represents a cost-effective tool to explore genome-wide variability. Nonmodel organisms do not usually have a reference genome and the transcriptome must be assembled de-novo. We used RNA-seq to obtain the transcriptomic profile for Oreobates cruralis, a poorly known South American direct-developing frog. In total, 550,871 transcripts were assembled, corresponding to 422,999 putative genes. Of those, we identified 23,500, 37,349, 38,120 and 45,885 genes present in the Pfam, EggNOG, KEGG and GO databases, respectively. Interestingly, our results suggested that genes related to immune system and defense mechanisms are abundant in the transcriptome of O. cruralis. We also present a pipeline to assist with pre-processing, assembling, evaluating and functionally annotating a de-novo transcriptome from RNA-seq data of non-model organisms. Our pipeline guides the inexperienced user in an intuitive way through all the necessary steps to build de-novo transcriptome assemblies using readily available software and is freely available at: https://github.com/biomendi/TRANSCRIPTOME-ASSEMBLY-PIPELINE/wiki. © 2017 Montero-Mendieta et al.

N2  - Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used in a range of biomedical studies. Nonetheless, current RNA-seq analysis tools are not specifically designed to efficiently process scRNA-seq data due to their limited scalability. Here we introduce Falco, a cloud-based framework to enable paralellization of existing RNA-seq processing pipelines using big data technologies of Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark for performing massively parallel analysis of large scale transcriptomic data. Using two public scRNA-seq datasets and two popular RNA-seq alignment/feature quantification pipelines, we show that the same processing pipeline runs 2.6-145.4 times faster using Falco than running on a highly optimized standalone computer. Falco also allows users to utilize low-cost spot instances of Amazon Web Services, providing a ∼65% reduction in cost of analysis. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.

N2  - Background: The identification of disease-causing variants in autosomal dominant diseases using exome-sequencing data remains a difficult task in small pedigrees. We combined several strategies to improve filtering and prioritizing of heterozygous variants using exome-sequencing datasets in familial Meniere disease: an in-house Pathogenic Variant (PAVAR) score, the Variant Annotation Analysis and Search Tool (VAAST-Phevor), Exomiser-v2, CADD, and FATHMM. We also validated the method by a benchmarking procedure including causal mutations in synthetic exome datasets. Results: PAVAR and VAAST were able to select the same sets of candidate variants independently of the studied disease. In contrast, Exomiser V2 and VAAST-Phevor had a variable correlation depending on the phenotypic information available for the disease on each family. Nevertheless, all the selected diseases ranked a limited number of concordant variants in the top 10 ranking, using the three systems or other combined algorithm such as CADD or FATHMM. Benchmarking analyses confirmed that the combination of systems with different approaches improves the prediction of candidate variants compared with the use of a single method. The overall efficiency of combined tools ranges between 68 and 71% in the top 10 ranked variants. Conclusions: Our pipeline prioritizes a short list of heterozygous variants in exome datasets based on the top 10 concordant variants combining multiple systems. © The Author(s). 2017.

N2  - Background: The 15 sibling species of the Paramecium aurelia cryptic species complex emerged after a whole genome duplication that occurred tens of millions of years ago. Given extensive knowledge of the genetics and epigenetics of Paramecium acquired over the last century, this species complex offers a uniquely powerful system to investigate the consequences of whole genome duplication in a unicellular eukaryote as well as the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that drive speciation. High quality Paramecium gene models are important for research using this system. The major aim of the work reported here was to build an improved gene annotation pipeline for the Paramecium lineage. Results: We generated oriented RNA-Seq transcriptome data across the sexual process of autogamy for the model species Paramecium tetraurelia. We determined, for the first time in a ciliate, candidate P. tetraurelia transcription start sites using an adapted Cap-Seq protocol. We developed TrUC, multi-threaded Perl software that in conjunction with TopHat mapping of RNA-Seq data to a reference genome, predicts transcription units for the annotation pipeline. We used EuGene software to combine annotation evidence. The high quality gene structural annotations obtained for P. tetraurelia were used as evidence to improve published annotations for 3 other Paramecium species. The RNA-Seq data were also used for differential gene expression analysis, providing a gene expression atlas that is more sensitive than the previously established microarray resource. Conclusions: We have developed a gene annotation pipeline tailored for the compact genomes and tiny introns of Paramecium species. A novel component of this pipeline, TrUC, predicts transcription units using Cap-Seq and oriented RNA-Seq data. TrUC could prove useful beyond Paramecium, especially in the case of high gene density. Accurate predictions of 3' and 5' UTR will be particularly valuable for studies of gene expression (e.g. nucleosome positioning, identification of cis regulatory motifs). The P. tetraurelia improved transcriptome resource, gene annotations for P. tetraurelia, P. biaurelia, P. sexaurelia and P. caudatum, and Paramecium-trained EuGene configuration are available through ParameciumDB ( http://paramecium.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr ).

N2  - Processing of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data requires significant technical skills, involving installation, configuration, and execution of bioinformatics data pipelines, in addition to specialized postanalysis visualization and data mining software. In order to address some of these challenges, developers have leveraged virtualization containers toward seamless deployment of preconfigured bioinformatics software and pipelines on any computational platform. We present an approach for abstracting the complex data operations of multistep, bioinformatics pipelines for NGS data analysis. As examples, we have deployed 2 pipelines for RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, preconfigured within Docker virtualization containers we call Bio-Docklets. Each Bio-Docklet exposes a single data input and output endpoint and from a user perspective, running the pipelines as simply as running a single bioinformatics tool. This is achieved using a "meta-script" that automatically starts the Bio-Docklets and controls the pipeline execution through the BioBlend software library and the Galaxy Application Programming Interface. The pipeline output is postprocessed by integration with the Visual Omics Explorer framework, providing interactive data visualizations that users can access through a web browser. Our goal is to enable easy access to NGS data analysis pipelines for nonbioinformatics experts on any computing environment, whether a laboratory workstation, university computer cluster, or a cloud service provider. Beyond end users, the Bio-Docklets also enables developers to programmatically deploy and run a large number of pipeline instances for concurrent analysis of multiple datasets. © The Author 2017.

N2  - Background: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are commonly used to identify key regulatory networks that drive transcriptional programs. Although these technologies are frequently used in biological studies, NGS data analysis remains a challenging, time-consuming, and often irreproducible process. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive and flexible workflow platform that can accelerate data processing and analysis so more time can be spent on functional studies. Results: We have developed an integrative, stand-alone workflow platform, named CIPHER, for the systematic analysis of several commonly used NGS datasets including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, MNase-seq, DNase-seq, GRO-seq, and ATAC-seq data. CIPHER implements various open source software packages, in-house scripts, and Docker containers to analyze and process single-ended and pair-ended datasets. CIPHER's pipelines conduct extensive quality and contamination control checks, as well as comprehensive downstream analysis. A typical CIPHER workflow includes: (1) raw sequence evaluation, (2) read trimming and adapter removal, (3) read mapping and quality filtering, (4) visualization track generation, and (5) extensive quality control assessment. Furthermore, CIPHER conducts downstream analysis such as: narrow and broad peak calling, peak annotation, and motif identification for ChIP-seq, differential gene expression analysis for RNA-seq, nucleosome positioning for MNase-seq, DNase hypersensitive site mapping, site annotation and motif identification for DNase-seq, analysis of nascent transcription from Global-Run On (GRO-seq) data, and characterization of chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq datasets. In addition, CIPHER contains an "analysis" mode that completes complex bioinformatics tasks such as enhancer discovery and provides functions to integrate various datasets together. Conclusions: Using public and simulated data, we demonstrate that CIPHER is an efficient and comprehensive workflow platform that can analyze several NGS datasets commonly used in genome biology studies. Additionally, CIPHER's integrative "analysis" mode allows researchers to elicit important biological information from the combined dataset analysis. © 2017 The Author(s).

N2  - Over the last decade, a large number of nucleotide sequences have been generated by next-generation sequencing technologies and deposited to public databases. However, most of these datasets do not specify the sex of individuals sampled because researchers typically ignore or hide this information. Male and female genomes in many species have distinctive sex chromosomes, XX/XY and ZW/ZZ, and expression levels of many sex-related genes differ between the sexes. Herein, we describe how to develop sex marker sequences from syntenic regions of sex chromosomes and use them to quickly identify the sex of individuals being analyzed. Array-based technologies routinely use either known sex markers or the B-allele frequency of X or Z chromosomes to deduce the sex of an individual. The same strategy has been used with whole-exome/genome sequence data; however, all reads must be aligned onto a reference genome to determine the B-allele frequency of the X or Z chromosomes. SEXCMD is a pipeline that can extract sex marker sequences from reference sex chromosomes and rapidly identify the sex of individuals from whole-exome/ genome and RNA sequencing after training with a known dataset through a simple machine learning approach. The pipeline counts total numbers of hits from sex-specific marker sequences and identifies the sex of the individuals sampled based on the fact that XX/ZZ samples do not have Y or W chromosome hits. We have successfully validated our pipeline with mammalian (Homo sapiens; XY) and avian (Gallus gallus; ZW) genomes. Typical calculation time when applying SEXCMD to human whole-exome or RNA sequencing datasets is a few minutes, and analyzing human whole-genome datasets takes about 10 minutes. Another important application of SEXCMD is as a quality control measure to avoid mixing samples before bioinformatics analysis.

N2  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a high-throughput technology that provides unique insights into the transcriptome. It has a wide variety of applications in quantifying genes/isoforms and in detecting non-coding RNA, alternative splicing, and splice junctions. It is extremely important to comprehend the entire transcriptome for a thorough understanding of the cellular system. Several RNA-seq analysis pipelines have been proposed to date. However, no single analysis pipeline can capture dynamics of the entire transcriptome. Here, we compile and present a robust and commonly used analytical pipeline covering the entire spectrum of transcriptome analysis, including quality checks, alignment of reads, differential gene/transcript expression analysis, discovery of cryptic splicing events, and visualization. Challenges, critical parameters, and possible downstream functional analysis pipelines associated with each step are highlighted and discussed. This unit provides a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art RNA-seq analysis pipeline and a greater understanding of the transcriptome. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

N2  - Cell-based assays are an attractive option to measure gene expression response to exposure, but the cost of whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing has been a barrier to the use of gene expression profiling for in vitro toxicity screening. In addition, standard RNA sequencing adds variability due to variable transcript length and amplification. Targeted probe-sequencing technologies such as TempO-Seq, with transcriptomic representation that can vary from hundreds of genes to the entire transcriptome, may reduce some components of variation. Analyses of high-throughput toxicogenomics data require renewed attention to read-calling algorithms and simplified dose-response modeling for datasets with relatively few samples. Using data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes treated with chemicals at varying concentrations, we describe here and make available a pipeline for handling expression data generated by TempO-Seq to align reads, clean and normalize raw count data, identify differentially expressed genes, and calculate transcriptomic concentration-response points of departure. The methods are extensible to other forms of concentration-response gene-expression data, and we discuss the utility of the methods for assessing variation in susceptibility and the diseased cellular state. © 2017 House, Grimm, Jima, Zhou, Rusyn and Wright.

N2  - Background: The three prime untranslated region (3'-UTR) is known to play a pivotal role in modulating gene expression by determining the fate of mRNA. Many crucial developmental events, such as mammalian spermatogenesis, tissue patterning, sex determination and neurogenesis, rely heavily on post-transcriptional regulation by the 3'-UTR. However, 3'-UTR biology seems to be a relatively untapped field, with only limited tools and 3'-UTR resources available. To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of the 3'-UTR on gene expression, firstly the 3'-UTR sequences must be identified. Current 3'-UTR mining tools, such as GETUTR, 3USS and UTRscan, all depend on a well-annotated reference genome or curated 3'-UTR sequences, which hinders their application on a myriad of non-model organisms where the genomes are not available. To address these issues, the establishment of an NGS-based, automated pipeline is urgently needed for genome-wide 3'-UTR prediction in the absence of reference genomes. Results: Here, we propose ExUTR, a novel NGS-based pipeline to predict and retrieve 3'-UTR sequences from RNA-Seq experiments, particularly designed for non-model species lacking well-annotated genomes. This pipeline integrates cutting-edge bioinformatics tools, databases (Uniprot and UTRdb) and novel in-house Perl scripts, implementing a fully automated workflow. By taking transcriptome assemblies as inputs, this pipeline identifies 3'-UTR signals based primarily on the intrinsic features of transcripts, and outputs predicted 3'-UTR candidates together with associated annotations. In addition, ExUTR only requires minimal computational resources, which facilitates its implementation on a standard desktop computer with reasonable runtime, making it affordable to use for most laboratories. We also demonstrate the functionality and extensibility of this pipeline using publically available RNA-Seq data from both model and non-model species, and further validate the accuracy of predicted 3'-UTR using both well-characterized 3'-UTR resources and 3P-Seq data. Conclusions:ExUTR is a practical and powerful workflow that enables rapid genome-wide 3'-UTR discovery from NGS data. The candidates predicted through this pipeline will further advance the study of miRNA target prediction, cis elements in 3'-UTR and the evolution and biology of 3'-UTRs. Being independent of a well-annotated reference genome will dramatically expand its application to much broader research area, encompassing all species for which RNA-Seq is available. © 2017 The Author(s).

N2  - Although many tools have been developed to analyze small RNA sequencing (sRNA-Seq) data, it remains challenging to accurately analyze the small RNA population, mainly due to multiple sequence ID assignment caused by short read length. Additional issues in small RNA analysis include low consistency of microRNA (miRNA) measurement results across different platforms, miRNA mapping associated with miRNA sequence variation (isomiR) and RNA editing, and the origin of those unmapped reads after screening against all endogenous reference sequence databases. To address these issues, we built a comprehensive and customizable sRNA-Seq data analysis pipeline-sRNAnalyzer, which enables: (i) comprehensive miRNA profiling strategies to better handle isomiRs and summarization based on each nucleotide position to detect potential SNPs in miRNAs, (ii) different sequence mapping result assignment approaches to simulate results from microarray/qRT-PCR platforms and a local probabilistic model to assign mapping results to the mostlikely IDs, (iii) comprehensive ribosomal RNA filtering for accurate mapping of exogenous RNAs and summarization based on taxonomy annotation. We evaluated our pipeline on both artificial samples (including synthetic miRNA and Escherichia coli cultures) and biological samples (human tissue and plasma). sRNAnalyzer is implemented in Perl and available at: http://srnanalyzer.systemsbiology.net/. © The Author(s) 2017.

N2  - Background: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is an increasingly popular platform to study heterogeneity at the single-cell level. Computational methods to process scRNA-Seq data are not very accessible to bench scientists as they require a significant amount of bioinformatic skills. Results: We have developed Granatum, a web-based scRNA-Seq analysis pipeline to make analysis more broadly accessible to researchers.

Granatum conveniently walks users through various steps of scRNA-Seq analysis. It has a comprehensive list of modules, including plate merging and batch-effect removal, outlier-sample removal, gene-expression normalization, imputation, gene filtering, cell clustering, differential gene expression analysis, pathway/ontology enrichment analysis, protein network interaction visualization, and pseudo-time cell series construction. Conclusions: Granatum enables broad adoption of scRNA-Seq technology by empowering bench scientists with an easy-to-use graphical interface for scRNA-Seq data analysis.

N2  - Designing novel RNA topologies is a challenge, with important therapeutic and industrial applications. We describe a computational pipeline for design of novel RNA topologies based on our coarse-grained RNA-As-Graphs (RAG) framework. RAG represents RNA structures as tree graphs and describes RNA secondary (2D) structure topologies (currently up to 13 vertices, ≈260 nucleotides). We have previously identified novel graph topologies that are RNA-like among these. Here we describe a systematic design pipeline and illustrate design for six broad design problems using recently developed tools for graph-partitioning and fragment assembly (F-RAG). Following partitioning of the target graph, corresponding atomic fragments from our RAG-3D database are combined using F-RAG, and the candidate atomic models are scored using a knowledge-based potential developed for 3D structure prediction. The sequences of the top scoring models are screened further using available tools for 2D structure prediction. The results indicate that our modular approach based on RNA-like topologies rather than specific 2D structures allows for greater flexibility in the design process, and generates a large number of candidate sequences quickly. Experimental structure probing using SHAPE-MaP for two sequences agree with our predictions and suggest that our combined tools yield excellent candidates for further sequence and experimental screening. © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Background and Objective: Docker is a light containerization program that shows almost the same performance as a local environment. Recently, many bioinformatics tools have been distributed as Docker images that include complex settings such as libraries, configurations, and data if needed, as well as the actual tools. Users can simply download and run them without making the effort to compile and configure them, and can obtain reproducible results. In spite of these advantages, several problems remain. First, there is a lack of clear standards for distribution of Docker images, and the Docker Hub often provides multiple images with the same objective but different uses. For these reasons, it can be difficult for users to learn how to select and use them. Second, Docker images are often not suitable as a component of a pipeline, because many of them include big data. Moreover, a group of users can have difficulties when sharing a pipeline composed of Docker images. Users of a group may modify scripts or use different versions of the data, which causes inconsistent results. Methods and Results: To handle the problems described above, we developed a Java web application, DockerBIO, which provides reliable, verified, light-weight Docker images for various bioinformatics tools and for various kinds of reference data. With DockerBIO, users can easily build a pipeline with tools and data registered at DockerBIO, and if necessary, users can easily register new tools or data. Built pipelines are registered in DockerBIO, which provides an efficient running environment for the pipelines registered at DockerBIO. This enables user groups to run their pipelines without expending much effort to copy and modify them. Copyright 2018 Kwon et al.

N2  - RNA-Seq is increasingly being used to measure human RNA expression on a genome-wide scale. Expression profiles can be interrogated to identify and functionally characterize treatment-responsive genes. Ultimately, such controlled studies promise to reveal insights into molecular mechanisms of treatment effects, identify biomarkers, and realize personalized medicine. RNA-Seq Reports (RSEQREP) is a new open-source cloud-enabled framework that allows users to execute start-to-end gene-level RNA-Seq analysis on a preconfigured RSEQREP Amazon Virtual Machine Image (AMI) hosted by AWS or on their own Ubuntu Linux machine via a Docker container or installation script. The framework works with unstranded, stranded, and paired-end sequence FASTQ files stored locally, on Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), or at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). RSEQREP automatically executes a series of customizable steps including reference alignment, CRAM compression, reference alignment QC, data normalization, multivariate data visualization, identification of differentially expressed genes, heatmaps, co-expressed gene clusters, enriched pathways, and a series of custom visualizations. The framework outputs a file collection that includes a dynamically generated PDF report using R, knitr, and LaTeX, as well as publication-ready table and figure files. A user-friendly configuration file handles sample metadata entry, processing, analysis, and reporting options. The configuration supports time series RNA-Seq experimental designs with at least one pre- and one post-treatment sample for each subject, as well as multiple treatment groups and specimen types. All RSEQREP analyses components are built using open-source R code and R/Bioconductor packages allowing for further customization. As a use case, we provide RSEQREP results for a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) RNA-Seq study that collected 1 pre-TIV and 10 post-TIV vaccination samples (days 1-10) for 5 subjects and two specimen types (peripheral blood mononuclear cells and B-cells). © 2018 Jensen TL et al.

N2  - RNA editing increases the diversity of the transcriptome and proteome. Adenosine-to-ino-sine (A-to-I) editing is the predominant type of RNA editing in mammals and it is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) family. Here, we used a largescale computational analysis of transcriptomic data from brain, heart, colon, lung, spleen, kidney, testes, skeletal muscle and liver, from three adult animals in order to identify RNA editing sites in bovine. We developed a computational pipeline and used a rigorous strategy to identify novel editing sites from RNA-Seq data in the absence of corresponding DNA sequence information. Our methods take into account sequencing errors, mapping bias, as well as biological replication to reduce the probability of obtaining a false-positive result. We conducted a detailed characterization of sequence and structural features related to novel candidate sites and found 1,600 novel canonical A-to-I editing sites in the nine bovine tissues analyzed. Results show that these sites 1) occur frequently in clusters and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) repeats, 2) have a preference for guanines depletion/enrichment in the flanking 50/30 nucleotide, 3) occur less often in coding sequences than other regions of the genome, and 4) have low evolutionary conservation. Further, we found that a positive correlation exists between expression of ADAR family members and tissue-specific RNA editing. Most of the genes with predicted A-to-I editing in each tissue were significantly enriched in biological terms relevant to the function of the corresponding tissue. Lastly, the results highlight the importance of the RNA editome in nervous system regulation. The present study extends the list of RNA editing sites in bovine and provides pipelines that may be used to investigate the editome in other organisms. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

N2  - Background: The development of high-throughput experimental technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, have led to new challenges for handling, analyzing and integrating the resulting large and diverse datasets. Bioinformatical analysis of these data commonly requires a number of mutually dependent steps applied to numerous samples for multiple conditions and replicates. To support these analyses, a number of workflow management systems (WMSs) have been developed to allow automated execution of corresponding analysis workflows. Major advantages of WMSs are the easy reproducibility of results as well as the reusability of workflows or their components. Results: In this article, we present Watchdog, a WMS for the automated analysis of large-scale experimental data. Main features include straightforward processing of replicate data, support for distributed computer systems, customizable error detection and manual intervention into workflow execution. Watchdog is implemented in Java and thus platform-independent and allows easy sharing of workflows and corresponding program modules. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for workflow construction using pre-defined modules as well as a helper script for creating new module definitions. Execution of workflows is possible using either the GUI or a command-line interface and a web-interface is provided for monitoring the execution status and intervening in case of errors. To illustrate its potentials on a real-life example, a comprehensive workflow and modules for the analysis of RNA-seq experiments were implemented and are provided with the software in addition to simple test examples. Conclusions:Watchdog is a powerful and flexible WMS for the analysis of large-scale high-throughput experiments. We believe it will greatly benefit both users with and without programming skills who want to develop and apply bioinformatical workflows with reasonable overhead.

Here we describe a bioinformatic pipeline, BALDR (BCR Assignment of Lineage using De novo Reconstruction) that accurately reconstructs the paired heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene sequences from Illumina single-cell RNA-seq data. BALDR was accurate for clonotype identification in human and rhesus macaque influenza vaccine and simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine induced vaccine-induced plasmablasts and naïve and antigen-specific memory B cells. BALDR enables matching of clonotype identity with single-cell transcriptional information in B cell lineages and will have broad application in the fields of vaccines, human immunodeficiency virus broadly neutralizing antibody development, and cancer.

N2  - Background: Ginseng is a popular traditional herbal medicine in north-eastern Asia. It has been used for human health for over thousands of years. With the rise in global temperature, the production of Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A.Meyer) in Korea have migrated from mid to northern parts of the Korean peninsula to escape from the various higher temperature related stresses. Under the high ambient temperature, vegetative growth was accelerated, which resulted in early flowering. This precocious phase change led to yield loss. Despite of its importance as a traditional medicine, biological mechanisms of ginseng has not been well studied and even the genome sequence of ginseng is yet to be determined due to its complex genome structure. Thus, it is challenging to investigate the molecular biology mechanisms at the transcript level. Results: To investigate how ginseng responds to the high ambient temperature environment, we performed high throughput RNA sequencing and implemented a bioinformatics pipeline for the integrated analysis of small-RNA and mRNA-seq data without a reference genome. By performing reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR and sanger sequencing of transcripts that were assembled using our pipeline, we validated that their sequences were expressed in our samples. Furthermore, to investigate the interaction between genes and non-coding small RNAs and their regulation status under the high ambient temperature, we identified potential gene regulatory miRNAs. As a result, 100,672 contigs with significant expression level were identified and 6 known, 214 conserved and 60 potential novel miRNAs were predicted to be expressed under the high ambient temperature. Conclusion: Collectively, we have found that development, flowering and temperature responsive genes were induced under high ambient temperature, whereas photosynthesis related genes were repressed. Functional miRNAs were down-regulated under the high ambient temperature. Among them are miR156 and miR396 that target flowering (SPL6/9) and growth regulating genes (GRF) respectively. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Genetic data analysis of large numbers of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), exome chips, and whole exome (WES) or whole-genome (WGS) sequencing data, requires well defined processing steps. As a result, several freely available analytic toolkits have been developed to streamline these processes. Among these, PLINK is the most comprehensive in terms of its quality control and analytic modules, although its focus remains on SNVs. PLINK fulfills two analytic needs-aiding the process of performing quality control (QC) on large data sets and providing basic statistical tools to analyze the variants in genetic models. The current version of PLINK (v1.90b) has incorporated several sophisticated statistical modeling features, such as those that were introduced by GCTA (genome-wide complex trait analysis), including mixed-model association analysis and cluster-based algorithms. Although PLINK is diverse in its applicability to data management and analysis, in some instances, other available tools offer more optimal options. Here we provide a practical overview of major PLINK features with respect to QC, data management, and association mapping, along with learned shortcuts and limitations to be considered. In cases where PLINK features are limited, we provide alternative approaches using additional freely available pipelines. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

N2  - Background: RNA sequencing has become a ubiquitous technology used throughout life sciences as an effective method of measuring RNA abundance quantitatively in tissues and cells. The increase in use of RNA-seq technology has led to the continuous development of new tools for every step of analysis from alignment to downstream pathway analysis. However, effectively using these analysis tools in a scalable and reproducible way can be challenging, especially for non-experts. Results: Using the workflow management system Snakemake we have developed a user friendly, fast, efficient, and comprehensive pipeline for RNA-seq analysis. VIPER (Visualization Pipeline for RNA-seq analysis) is an analysis workflow that combines some of the most popular tools to take RNA-seq analysis from raw sequencing data, through alignment and quality control, into downstream differential expression and pathway analysis. VIPER has been created in a modular fashion to allow for the rapid incorporation of new tools to expand the capabilities. This capacity has already been exploited to include very recently developed tools that explore immune infiltrate and T-cell CDR (Complementarity-Determining Regions) reconstruction abilities. The pipeline has been conveniently packaged such that minimal computational skills are required to download and install the dozens of software packages that VIPER uses. Conclusions: VIPER is a comprehensive solution that performs most standard RNA-seq analyses quickly and effectively with a built-in capacity for customization and expansion. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Control of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability is an important aspect of gene regulation. The gold standard for measuring mRNA stability transcriptome-wide uses metabolic labeling, biochemical isolation of labeled RNA populations, and high-throughput sequencing. However, difficult normalization procedures have inhibited widespread adoption of this approach. Here, we present DRUID (for determination of rates using intron dynamics), a new computational pipeline that is robust, easy to use, and freely available. Our pipeline uses endogenous introns to normalize time course data and yields reproducible half-lives, even with data sets that were otherwise unusable. DRUID can handle data sets from a variety of organisms, spanning yeast to humans, and we even applied it retroactively on published data sets. We anticipate that DRUID will allow broad application of metabolic labeling for studies of transcript stability. © 2018 Lugowski et al.

N2  - The single-molecule real-time (SMRT) isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) based on Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) platform has received increasing attention for its ability to explore full-length isoforms. Thus, comprehensive tools for Iso-Seq bioinformatics analysis are extremely useful. Here, we present a one-stop solution for Iso-Seq analysis, called PRAPI to analyze alternative transcription initiation (ATI), alternative splicing (AS), alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA), natural antisense transcripts (NAT), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) comprehensively. PRAPI is capable of combining Iso-Seq full-length isoforms with short read data, such as RNA-Seq or polyadenylation site sequencing (PAS-seq) for differential expression analysis of NAT, AS, APA and circRNAs. Furthermore, PRAPI can annotate new genes and correct mis-annotated genes when gene annotation is available. Finally, PRAPI generates high-quality vector graphics to visualize and highlight the Iso-Seq results.

N2  - Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses can benefit from performing a genome-guided and de novo assembly, in particular for species where the reference genome or the annotation is incomplete. However, tools for integrating an assembled transcriptome with reference annotation are lacking. Findings: Necklace is a software pipeline that runs genome-guided and de novo assembly and combines the resulting transcriptomes with reference genome annotations. Necklace constructs a compact but comprehensive superTranscriptome out of the assembled and reference data. Reads are subsequently aligned and counted in preparation for differential expression testing. Conclusions: Necklace allows a comprehensive transcriptome to be built from a combination of assembled and annotated transcripts, which results in a more comprehensive transcriptome for the majority of organisms. In addition RNA-seq data are mapped back to this newly created superTranscript reference to enable differential expression testing with standard methods.

N2  - Background: Complex microbial communities are an area of growing interest in biology. Metatranscriptomics allows researchers to quantify microbial gene expression in an environmental sample via high-throughput sequencing. Metatranscriptomic experiments are computationally intensive because the experiments generate a large volume of sequence data and each sequence must be compared with reference sequences from thousands of organisms. Results: SAMSA2 is an upgrade to the original Simple Annotation of Metatranscriptomes by Sequence Analysis (SAMSA) pipeline that has been redesigned for standalone use on a supercomputing cluster. SAMSA2 is faster due to the use of the DIAMOND aligner, and more flexible and reproducible because it uses local databases. SAMSA2 is available with detailed documentation, and example input and output files along with examples of master scripts for full pipeline execution. Conclusions: SAMSA2 is a rapid and efficient metatranscriptome pipeline for analyzing large RNA-seq datasets in a supercomputing cluster environment. SAMSA2 provides simplified output that can be examined directly or used for further analyses, and its reference databases may be upgraded, altered or customized to fit the needs of any experiment. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: The field of small RNA is one of the most investigated research areas since they were shown to regulate transposable elements and gene expression and play essential roles in fundamental biological processes. Small RNA deep sequencing (sRNA-seq) is now routinely used for large-scale analyses of small RNA. Such high-throughput sequencing typically produces several millions reads. Results: Here we present a computational pipeline (sRNAPipe: small RNA pipeline) based on the Galaxy framework that takes as input a fastq file of small RNA-seq reads and performs successive steps of mapping to categories of genomic sequences: transposable elements, gene transcripts, microRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs. It also provides individual mapping and counting for chromosomes, transposable elements and gene transcripts, normalization, small RNA length analysis and plotting of the data along genomic coordinates to build publication-quality graphs and figures. sRNAPipe evaluates 10-nucleotide 5′-overlaps of reads on opposite strands to test ping-pong amplification for putative PIWI-interacting RNAs, providing counts of overlaps and corresponding z-scores. Conclusions: sRNAPipe is easy to use and does not require command-line or coding knowledge. This pipeline gives quick visual and quantitative results, which are usable for publications. sRNAPipe is freely available as a Galaxy tool and via GitHub. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows researchers to profile the transcriptomes of thousands of cells simultaneously. Protocols that incorporate both designed and random barcodes have greatly increased the throughput of scRNA-seq, but give rise to a more complex data structure. There is a need for new tools that can handle the various barcoding strategies used by different protocols and exploit this information for quality assessment at the sample-level and provide effective visualization of these results in preparation for higher-level analyses. To this end, we developed scPipe, an R/Bioconductor package that integrates barcode demultiplexing, read alignment, UMI-aware gene-level quantification and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple protocols that include CEL-seq, MARS-seq, Chromium 10X, Drop-seq and Smart-seq. scPipe produces a count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with an HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing. scPipe performs this processing in a few simple R commands, promoting reproducible analysis of single-cell data that is compatible with the emerging suite of open-source scRNA-seq analysis tools available in R/Bioconductor and beyond. The scPipe R package is available for download from https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/scPipe. © 2018 Tian et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

N2  - Abstract In bioinformatics, as well as other computationally intensive research fields, there is a need for workflows that can reliably produce consistent output, from known sources, independent of the software environment or configuration settings of the machine on which they are executed. Indeed, this is essential for controlled comparison between different observations and for the wider dissemination of workflows. However, providing this type of reproducibility and traceability is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which generally comes in various versions. Moreover, in many fields (bioinformatics being a prime example), these versions are subject to continual change due to rapidly evolving technologies, further complicating problems related to reproducibility. Here, we propose a principled approach for building analysis pipelines and managing their dependencies with GNU Guix. As a case study to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present a set of highly reproducible pipelines called PiGx for the analysis of RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, bisulfite-treated DNA sequencing, and single-cell resolution RNA sequencing. All pipelines process raw experimental data and generate reports containing publication-ready plots and figures, with interactive report elements and standard observables. Users may install these highly reproducible packages and apply them to their own datasets without any special computational expertise beyond the use of the command line. We hope such a toolkit will provide immediate benefit to laboratory workers wishing to process their own datasets or bioinformaticians seeking to automate all, or parts of, their analyses. In the long term, we hope our approach to reproducibility will serve as a blueprint for reproducible workflows in other areas. Our pipelines, along with their corresponding documentation and sample reports, are available at http://bioinformatics.mdc-Berlin.de/pigx. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Targeted resequencing has become the most used and cost-effective approach for identifying causative mutations of Mendelian diseases both for diagnostics and research purposes. Due to very rapid technological progress, NGS laboratories are expanding their capabilities to address the increasing number of analyses. Several open source tools are available to build a generic variant calling pipeline, but a tool able to simultaneously execute multiple analyses, organize, and categorize the samples is still missing. Results: Here we describe VarGenius, a Linux based command line software able to execute customizable pipelines for the analysis of multiple targeted resequencing data using parallel computing. VarGenius provides a database to store the output of the analysis (calling quality statistics, variant annotations, internal allelic variant frequencies) and sample information (personal data, genotypes, phenotypes). VarGenius can also perform the "joint analysis" of hundreds of samples with a single command, drastically reducing the time for the configuration and execution of the analysis. VarGenius executes the standard pipeline of the Genome Analysis Tool-Kit (GATK) best practices (GBP) for germinal variant calling, annotates the variants using Annovar, and generates a user-friendly output displaying the results through a web page. VarGenius has been tested on a parallel computing cluster with 52 machines with 120GB of RAM each. Under this configuration, a 50 M whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis for a family was executed in about 7h (trio or quartet); a joint analysis of 30 WES in about 24 h and the parallel analysis of 34 single samples from a 1 M panel in about 2 h. Conclusions: We developed VarGenius, a "master" tool that faces the increasing demand of heterogeneous NGS analyses and allows maximum flexibility for downstream analyses. It paves the way to a different kind of analysis, centered on cohorts rather than on singleton. Patient and variant information are stored into the database and any output file can be accessed programmatically. VarGenius can be used for routine analyses by biomedical researchers with basic Linux skills providing additional flexibility for computational biologists to develop their own algorithms for the comparison and analysis of data.

These analyses include clustering, differential expression, pathway analyses, co-expression networks, marker gene identification, and autocrine-paracrine signaling prediction. Integration of seven datasets shows elevated BMP-WNT signaling in cystic fibrosis pancreata. © 2019 The Author(s)
Toolsets available for in-depth analysis of scRNA-seq datasets by biologists with little informatics experience is limited. Here, we describe an informatics tool (PyMINEr) that fully automates cell type identification, cell type-specific pathway analyses, graph theory-based analysis of gene regulation, and detection of autocrine-paracrine signaling networks in silico. We applied PyMINEr to interrogate human pancreatic islet scRNA-seq datasets and discovered several features of co-expression graphs, including concordance of scRNA-seq-graph structure with both protein-protein interactions and 3D genomic architecture, association of high-connectivity and low-expression genes with cell type enrichment, and potential for the graph structure to clarify potential etiologies of enigmatic disease-associated variants. We further created a consensus co-expression network and autocrine-paracrine signaling networks within and across islet cell types from seven datasets. PyMINEr correctly identified changes in BMP-WNT signaling associated with cystic fibrosis pancreatic acinar cell loss. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that the PyMINEr framework will be a valuable resource for scRNA-seq analyses. © 2019 The Author(s)

N2  - Background: Genetically engineered mice (GEM) are essential tools for understanding gene function and disease modeling. Historically, gene targeting was first done in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the 129 family of inbred strains, leading to a mixed background or congenic mice when crossed with C57BL/6 mice. Depending on the number of backcrosses and breeding strategies, genomic segments from 129-derived ESCs can be introgressed into the C57BL/6 genome, establishing a unique genetic makeup that needs characterization in order to obtain valid conclusions from experiments using GEM lines. Currently, SNP genotyping is used to detect the extent of 129-derived ESC genome introgression into C57BL/6 recipients; however, it fails to detect novel/rare variants. Results: Here, we present a computational pipeline implemented in the Galaxy platform and in BASH/R script to determine genetic introgression of GEM using next generation sequencing data (NGS), such as whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq. The pipeline includes strategies to uncover variants linked to a targeted locus, genome-wide variant visualization, and the identification of potential modifier genes. Although these methods apply to congenic mice, they can also be used to describe variants fixed by genetic drift. As a proof of principle, we analyzed publicly available RNA-Seq data from five congenic knockout (KO) lines and our own RNA-Seq data from the Sall2 KO line. Additionally, we performed target validation using several genetics approaches. Conclusions: We revealed the impact of the 129-derived ESC genome introgression on gene expression, predicted potential modifier genes, and identified potential phenotypic interference in KO lines. Our results demonstrate that our new approach is an effective method to determine genetic introgression of GEM. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Backgrounds: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is now widely used in biomedical research for various applications. Processing of NGS data requires multiple programs and customization of the processing pipelines according to the data platforms. However, rapid progress of the NGS applications and processing methods urgently require prompt update of the pipelines. Recent clinical applications of NGS technology such as cell-free DNA, cancer panel, or exosomal RNA sequencing data also require appropriate customization of the processing pipelines. Here, we developed SEQprocess, a highly extendable framework that can provide standard as well as customized pipelines for NGS data processing. Results: SEQprocess was implemented in an R package with fully modularized steps for data processing that can be easily customized. Currently, six pre-customized pipelines are provided that can be easily executed by non-experts such as biomedical scientists, including the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) pipelines as well as the popularly used pipelines for variant calling (e.g., GATK) and estimation of allele frequency, RNA abundance (e.g., TopHat2/Cufflink), or DNA copy numbers (e.g., Sequenza). In addition, optimized pipelines for the clinical sequencing from cell-free DNA or miR-Seq are also provided. The processed data were transformed into R package-compatible data type 'ExpressionSet' or 'SummarizedExperiment', which could facilitate subsequent data analysis within R environment. Finally, an automated report summarizing the processing steps are also provided to ensure reproducibility of the NGS data analysis. Conclusion: SEQprocess provides a highly extendable and R compatible framework that can manage customized and reproducible pipelines for handling multiple legacy NGS processing tools. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - RNA cytosine-5 methylation (m 5 C) has emerged as a key epitranscriptomic mark, which fulfills multiple roles in structural modulation, stress signaling and the regulation of protein translation. Bisulfite sequencing is currently the most accurate and reliable method to detect m 5 C marks at nucleotide resolution. Targeted bisulfite sequencing allows m 5 C detection at single base resolution, by combining the use of tailored primers with bisulfite treatment. A number of computational tools currently exist to analyse m 5 C marks in DNA bisulfite sequencing. However, these methods are not directly applicable to the analysis of RNA m 5 C marks, because DNA analysis focuses on CpG methylation, and because artifactual unconversion and misamplification in RNA can obscure actual methylation signals. We describe a pipeline designed specifically for RNA cytosine-5 methylation analysis in targeted bisulfite sequencing experiments. The pipeline is directly applicable to Illumina MiSeq (or equivalent) sequencing datasets using a web interface (https://bisamp.dkfz.de), and is defined by optimized mapping parameters and the application of tailored filters for the removal of artifacts. We provide examples for the application of this pipeline in the unambiguous detection of m 5 C marks in tRNAs from mouse embryonic stem cells and neuron-differentiated stem cells as well as in 28S rRNA from human fibroblasts. Finally, we also discuss the adaptability of BisAMP to the analysis of DNA methylation. Our pipeline provides an accurate, fast and user-friendly framework for the analysis of cytosine-5 methylation in amplicons from bisulfite-treated RNA. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The availability of low-cost small-factor sequencers, such as the Illumina MiSeq, MiniSeq, or iSeq, have paved the way for democratizing genomics sequencing, providing researchers in minority universities with access to the technology that was previously only affordable by institutions with large core facilities. However, these instruments are not bundled with software for performing bioinformatics data analysis, and the data analysis can be the main bottleneck for independent laboratories or even small clinical facilities that consider adopting genomic sequencing for medical applications. To address this issue, we have developed miCloud, a bioinformatics platform that enables genomic data analysis through a fully featured data analysis cloud, which seamlessly integrates with genome sequencers over the local network. The miCloud can be easily deployed without any prior bioinformatics expertise on any computing environment, from a laboratory computer workstation to a university computer cluster. Our platform not only provides access to a set of preconfigured RNA-Seq and CHIP-Seq bioinformatics pipelines, but also enables users to develop or install new preconfigured tools from the large selection available on open-source online Docker container repositories. The miCloud built-in analysis pipelines are also integrated with the Visual Omics Explorer framework (Kim et al., 2016), which provides rich interactive visualizations and publication-ready graphics from the next-generation sequencing data. Ultimately, the miCloud demonstrates a bioinformatics approach that can be adopted in the field for standardizing genomic data analysis, similarly to the way molecular biology sample preparation kits have standardized laboratory operations. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.

N2  - Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq, currently dominate genome-wide gene expression studies. A standard approach to analyse this data requires mapping sequence reads to a reference and counting the number of reads which map to each gene. However, for many transcriptome studies, a suitable reference genome is unavailable, especially for meta-transcriptome studies which assay gene expression from mixed populations of organisms. Where a reference is unavailable, it is possible to generate a reference by the de novo assembly of the sequence reads. However, the high cost of generating high-coverage data for de novo assembly hinders this approach and more importantly the accurate assembly of such data is challenging, especially for meta-transcriptome data, and resulting assemblies frequently suffer from collapsed regions or chimeric sequences. As an alternative to the standard reference mapping approach, we have developed a k-mer-based analysis pipeline (DiffKAP) to identify differentially expressed reads between RNA-Seq datasets without the requirement for a reference. We compared the DiffKAP approach with the traditional Tophat/Cuffdiff method using RNA-Seq data from soybean, which has a suitable reference genome. We subsequently examined differential gene expression for a coral meta-transcriptome where no reference is available, and validated the results using qRT-PCR. We conclude that DiffKAP is an accurate method to study differential gene expression in complex meta-transcriptomes without the requirement of a reference genome. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background: RNA-Seq technology is routinely used to characterize the transcriptome, and to detect gene expression differences among cell types, genotypes and conditions. Advances in short-read sequencing instruments such as Illumina Next-Seq have yielded easy-to-operate machines, with high throughput, at a lower price per base. However, processing this data requires bioinformatics expertise to tailor and execute specific solutions for each type of library preparation. Results: In order to enable fast and user-friendly data analysis, we developed an intuitive and scalable transcriptome pipeline that executes the full process, starting from cDNA sequences derived by RNA-Seq [Nat Rev Genet 10:57-63, 2009] and bulk MARS-Seq [Science 343:776-779, 2014] and ending with sets of differentially expressed genes. Output files are placed in structured folders, and results summaries are provided in rich and comprehensive reports, containing dozens of plots, tables and links. Conclusion: Our User-friendly Transcriptome Analysis Pipeline (UTAP) is an open source, web-based intuitive platform available to the biomedical research community, enabling researchers to efficiently and accurately analyse transcriptome sequence data. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Rapid advances in genomic technologies have facilitated the identification pathogenic variants causing human disease. We report siblings with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy due to a novel, shared heterozygous pathogenic 13 bp duplication in SYNGAP1 (c.435_447dup, p.(L150Vfs*6)) that was identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS). The pathogenic variant had escaped earlier detection via two methodologies: whole exome sequencing and high-depth targeted sequencing. Both technologies had produced reads carrying the variant, however, they were either not aligned due to the size of the insertion or aligned to multiple major histocompatibility complex (MHC) regions in the hg19 reference genome, making the critical reads unavailable for variant calling. The WGS pipeline followed different protocols, including alignment of reads to the GRCh37 reference genome, which lacks the additional MHC contigs. Our findings highlight the benefit of using orthogonal clinical bioinformatic pipelines and all relevant inheritance patterns to re-analyze genomic data in undiagnosed patients. © 2018 The Authors.

N2  - Most of the research studies developed applying microarray technology to the characterization of different pathological states of any disease may fail in reaching statistically significant results. This is largely due to the small repertoire of analysed samples, and to the limitation in the number of states or pathologies usually addressed. Moreover, the influence of potential deviations on the gene expression quantification is usually disregarded. In spite of the continuous changes in omic sciences, reflected for instance in the emergence of new Next-Generation Sequencing-related technologies, the existing availability of a vast amount of gene expression microarray datasets should be properly exploited. Therefore, this work proposes a novel methodological approach involving the integration of several heterogeneous skin cancer series, and a later multiclass classifier design. This approach is thus a way to provide the clinicians with an intelligent diagnosis support tool based on the use of a robust set of selected biomarkers, which simultaneously distinguishes among different cancerrelated skin states. To achieve this, a multi-platform combination of microarray datasets from Affymetrix and Illumina manufacturers was carried out. This integration is expected to strengthen the statistical robustness of the study as well as the finding of highly-reliable skin cancer biomarkers. Specifically, the designed operation pipeline has allowed the identification of a small subset of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from which to distinguish among 7 involved skin states. These genes were obtained from the assessment of a number of potential batch effects on the gene expression data. The biological interpretation of these genes was inspected in the specific literature to understand their underlying information in relation to skin cancer. Finally, in order to assess their possible effectiveness in cancer diagnosis, a cross-validation Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based classification including feature ranking was performed. The accuracy attained exceeded the 92% in overall recognition of the 7 different cancer-related skin states. The proposed integration scheme is expected to allow the co-integration with other state-of-the-art technologies such as RNA-seq.

N2  - Background: Many bioinformatics pipelines are available nowadays to analyze transcriptomics data produced by high-throughput RNA sequencing. They implement different workflows that address several analysis tasks, supported by the use of third party programs. Nevertheless, a proper workflow definition for RNA-seq data analysis is still lacking. Objective: To proper define what a comprehensive RNA-seq data analysis workflow should be. Compare all available pipelines and, if such a solution is not available, implement a new pipeline. Method: We have developed a new pipeline integrating state-of-the art programs for different parts of the RNA-seq analysis. We also have used RUbioSeq libraries to achieve a scalable solution. Results: We have defined a comprehensive RNA-seq data analysis workflow, comprising the most common needs demanded by biologists and implemented it in a new pipeline, nextpresso. We also validate it in two case studies presented here. Conclusion: Nexpresso is a new, freely available, pipeline covering the most common needs of RNA-seq data analysis. It is easy to configure, generates user friendly results and scales well for larger studies comprising a high number of samples.

N2  - Background: The usual analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads is based on an existing reference genome and annotated gene models. However, when a reference for the sequenced species is not available, alternatives include using a reference genome from a related species or reconstructing transcript sequences with de novo assembly. In addition, researchers are faced with many options for RNA-seq data processing and limited information on how their decisions will impact the final outcome. Using both a diploid and polyploid species with a distant reference genome, we have tested the influence of different tools at various steps of a typical RNA-seq analysis workflow on the recovery of useful processed data available for downstream analysis. Findings: At the preprocessing step, we found error correction has a strong influence on de novo assembly but not on mapping results. After trimming, a greater percentage of reads could be used in downstream analysis by selecting gentle quality trimming performed with Skewer instead of strict quality trimming with Trimmomatic. This availability of reads correlated with size, quality, and completeness of de novo assemblies and with number of mapped reads. When selecting a reference genome from a related species to map reads, outcome was significantly improved when using mapping software tolerant of greater sequence divergence, such as Stampy or GSNAP. Conclusions: The selection of bioinformatic software tools for RNA-seq data analysis can maximize quality parameters on de novo assemblies and availability of reads in downstream analysis.
