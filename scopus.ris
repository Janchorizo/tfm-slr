AB  - DNA methylation is a crucial regulator of gene transcription in the etiology and pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, it is reasonable to identify DNA methylation-related prognostic markers. Currently, we aimed to make an integrative epigenetic analysis of HCC to identify the effectiveness of epigenetic drivers in predicting prognosis for HCC patients. By the software pipeline TCGA-Assembler 2, RNA-seq, and methylation data were downloaded and processed from The Cancer Genome Atlas. A bioconductor package MethylMix was utilized to incorporate gene expression and methylation data on all 363 samples and identify 589 epigenetic drivers with transcriptionally predictive. By univariate survival analysis, 72 epigenetic drivers correlated with overall survival (OS) were selected for further analysis in our training cohort. By the robust likelihood-based survival model, six epi-drivers (doublecortin domain containing 2, flavin containing monooxygenase 3, G protein-coupled receptor 171, Lck interacting transmembrane adaptor 1, S100 calcium binding protein P, small nucleolar RNA host gene 6) serving as prognostic markers was identified and then a DNA methylation signature for HCC (MSH) predicting OS was identified to stratify patients into low-risk and high-risk groups in the training cohort (p < 0.001). The capability of MSH was also assessed in the validation cohort (p = 0.002). Furthermore, a receiver operating characteristic curve confirmed MSH as an effective prognostic model for predicting OS in HCC patients in training area under curve (AUC = 0.802) and validation (AUC = 0.691) cohorts. Finally, a nomogram comprising MSH and pathologic stage was generated to predict OS in the training cohort, and it also operated effectively in the validation cohort (concordance index: 0.674). In conclusion, MSH, a six epi-drivers based signature, is a potential model to predict prognosis for HCC patients. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Edwardsiella tarda belongs to the genera of Gram negative bacterium mainly associated with edwardsiellosis, the most commonly found infectious fish disease throughout the globe. E. tarda is also a widespread pathogen which cause infections such as cellulitis or gas gangrene and generalized infections in humans. To control the escalating infection of E. trada on various species, it is essential to decoded the mysterious mechanism behind the bacterial infection at transcript level. In this present study, we carry out a de novo E. tarda Whole transcriptome sequencing, isolated from infected fish intestine using SOLiD sequencing platform. RNA-Seq data analysis was performed using various bioinformatics pipelines. Protein-protein interaction study for pathway enrichment and gene ontology study were executed for further investigation. Assembly statistics for E. tarda dataset showed that the number of transcript contigs was 9657 out of which 6749 were GO annotated whereas 1528 were not assigned any GO terms. GO analysis showed that the expressed genes were enhanced with molecular function, cellular component and biological process. A KEGG enrichment study showed that pathway's that are directly linked with immune diseases like Rheumatoid arthritis (0.2%), Tuberculosis (0.3%) Endocytosis (0.6%) was considerably enriched. Protein-protein interaction study showed that most of the expressed proteins were involved in metabolic pathways, flagellar assembly, Propanoate metabolism, Microbial metabolism in diverse environments, Butanoate metabolism and Carbon. The present study provides novel E. tarda transcriptome sequence data, allowing us to identify biologically significant genes and their functional relationship with fish diseases, and will be useful in recognize the reliable therapeutic targets in near feature. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a recent addition to the expanding universe of RNA species and originate through back-splicing events from linear primary transcripts. CircRNAs show specific expression profiles with regards to cell type and developmental stage. Importantly, only few circRNAs have been functionally characterized to date. The detection of circRNAs from RNA sequencing data is a complex computational workflow that, depending on tissue and condition typically yields candidate sets of hundreds or thousands of circRNA candidates. Here, we provide an overview on different computational analysis tools and pipelines that became available throughout the last years. We outline technical and experimental requirements that are common to all approaches and point out potential pitfalls during the computational analysis. Although computational prediction of circRNAs has become quite mature in recent years, we provide a set of valuable validation strategies, in silico as well as in vitro-based approaches. In addition to circRNA detection via back-splicing junction, we present available analysis pipelines for delineating the primary sequence and for predicting possible functions of circRNAs. Finally, we outline the most important web resources for circRNA research.

AB  - To achieve large-scale, high-throughput experiments for systems biology research of microorganisms, reliable data from robust cultivation systems are needed. Chemostats are such systems, ensuring reproducibility and quality by providing a stable, well-controlled environment for the cells. However, many of the available chemostat systems require large amounts of media and are complex to set up and expensive to purchase and maintain. To address these concerns, we developed a mini-chemostat (MC) system with 16 reactors, each at a working volume of 40 ml. Sensors measure dissolved oxygen in the reactor, while OD600 is measured in the outflow. We further developed a CO 2 and pH sensor array that can be plugged into the outflow of the reactors. The system was used to characterize yeast physiology at four metabolically different conditions: limitations of glucose, both aerobic and anaerobic, nitrogen, and ethanol. The physiology of yeast cells grown at the four different conditions in the MC system was compared with the yeast cells grown in a DASGIP 1 L system using RNAseq analysis. The results show that the MC system provides the same environmental conditions as the DASGIP system and that the MC system is reproducible between different runs. The system is built to be easily scalable with more reactors and to include more sensors, if available. Our study shows that a robust, reproducible chemostat system for high-throughput and large-scale experiments can be built at low costs. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Assessment of Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) for response stratification of cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors is emerging as a new biomarker. Commonly defined as the total number of exonic somatic mutations, TMB approximates the amount of neoantigens that potentially are recognized by the immune system. While whole exome sequencing (WES) is an unbiased approach to quantify TMB, implementation in diagnostics is hampered by tissue availability as well as time and cost constrains. Conversely, panel-based targeted sequencing is nowadays widely used in routine molecular diagnostics, but only very limited data are available on its performance for TMB estimation. Here, we evaluated three commercially available larger gene panels with covered genomic regions of 0.39 Megabase pairs (Mbp), 0.53 Mbp and 1.7 Mbp using i) in silico analysis of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data and ii) wet-lab sequencing of a total of 92 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cancer samples grouped in three independent cohorts (non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC; colorectal cancer, CRC; and mixed cancer types) for which matching WES data were available. We observed a strong correlation of the panel data with WES mutation counts especially for the gene panel >1Mbp. Sensitivity and specificity related to TMB cutpoints for checkpoint inhibitor response in NSCLC determined by wet-lab experiments well reflected the in silico data. Additionally, we highlight potential pitfalls in bioinformatics pipelines and provide recommendations for variant filtering. In summary, our study is a valuable data source for researchers working in the field of immuno-oncology as well as for diagnostic laboratories planning TMB testing. © 2018 UICC

AB  - The brain as an important organ can be affected largely by aging, and the comprehensive transcriptional underpinnings of brain aging remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a high throughput RNA sequencing to evaluate the expression profiles of messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), micro RNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in porcine brain. We have identified 714 mRNAs, 38lncRNAs, 41miRNAs, and 148circRNAs were age-related genes in the porcine cerebral cortex. The lncRNAs, miRNAs and circRNAs have effect on the age of porcine brain due to the much changes of expression level as noncoding RNAs. The up-regulated genes were significantly enriched for stress response, reproductive regulatory process, immune response and metabolic process, and the down-regulated genes were related to neurologic function, stress response and signaling pathway. The synaptic transmission pathway may be the key role in aging of porcine brain that it was co-enriched for in both differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs. Moreover, some lncRNAs and their target genes were also differentially expressed during brain aging. We further assessed the multi-group cooperative control relationships and constructed circRNA-miRNA co-expression networks during brain aging. We also selected 2 mRNAs, 2 lncRNAs, 2 miRNAs, and 1 circRNAs to perform the q-PCR, and the expression patterns were highly consistent between the two methods confirming the high reproducibility and reliability of the gene expression profiling in our study. In conclusion, our findings will contribute to understand the transcriptional underpinnings of brain aging and provide a foundation for future studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying brain aging. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Breast tumors are inherently heterogeneous, but the evolving cellular organization through neoplastic progression is poorly understood. Here we report a rapid, large-scale single-cell resolution 3D imaging protocol based on a one-step clearing agent that allows visualization of normal tissue architecture and entire tumors at cellular resolution. Imaging of multicolor lineage-tracing models of breast cancer targeted to either basal or luminal progenitor cells revealed profound clonal restriction during progression. Expression profiling of clones arising in Pten/Trp53-deficient tumors identified distinct molecular signatures. Strikingly, most clones harbored cells that had undergone an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, indicating widespread, inherent plasticity. Hence, an integrative pipeline that combines lineage tracing, 3D imaging, and clonal RNA sequencing technologies offers a comprehensive path for studying mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in whole tumors. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is an indispensable tool in the study of gene regulation. While the technology has brought with it better transcript coverage and quantification, there remain considerable barriers to entry for the computational biologist to analyse large data sets. There is a real need for a repository of uniformly processed RNA-seq data that is easy to use. Findings: To address these obstacles, we developed Digital Expression Explorer 2 (DEE2), a web-based repository of RNA-seq data in the form of gene-level and transcript-level expression counts. DEE2 contains >5.3 trillion assigned reads from 580,000 RNA-seq data sets including species Escherichia coli, yeast, Arabidopsis, worm, fruit fly, zebrafish, rat, mouse, and human. Base-space sequence data downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive underwent quality control prior to transcriptome and genome mapping using open-source tools. Uniform data processing methods ensure consistency across experiments, facilitating fast and reproducible meta-analyses. Conclusions: The web interface allows users to quickly identify data sets of interest using accession number and keyword searches. The data can also be accessed programmatically using a specifically designed R package. We demonstrate that DEE2 data are compatible with statistical packages such as edgeR or DESeq. Bulk data are also available for download. DEE2 can be found at http://dee2.io. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Background: RNA sequencing is a widely used technology for differential expression analysis. However, the RNA-Seq do not provide accurate absolute measurements and the results can be different for each pipeline used. The major problem in statistical analysis of RNA-Seq and in the omics data in general, is the small sample size with respect to the large number of variables. In addition, experimental design must be taken into account and few tools consider it. Results: We propose OMICfpp, a method for the statistical analysis of RNA-Seq paired design data. First, we obtain a p-value for each case-control pair using a binomial test. These p-values are aggregated using an ordered weighted average (OWA) with a given orness previously chosen. The aggregated p-value from the original data is compared with the aggregated p-value obtained using the same method applied to random pairs. These new pairs are generated using between-pairs and complete randomization distributions. This randomization p-value is used as a raw p-value to test the differential expression of each gene. The OMICfpp method is evaluated using public data sets of 68 sample pairs from patients with colorectal cancer. We validate our results through bibliographic search of the reported genes and using simulated data set. Furthermore, we compared our results with those obtained by the methods edgeR and DESeq2 for paired samples. Finally, we propose new target genes to validate these as gene expression signatures in colorectal cancer. OMICfpp is available at http://www.uv.es/ayala/software/OMICfpp-0.2.tar.gz. Conclusions: Our study shows that OMICfpp is an accurate method for differential expression analysis in RNA-Seq data with paired design. In addition, we propose the use of randomized p-values pattern graphic as a powerful and robust method to select the target genes for experimental validation. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Blood-based diagnostics tests, using individual or panels of biomarkers, may revolutionize disease diagnostics and enable minimally invasive therapy monitoring. However, selection of the most relevant biomarkers from liquid biosources remains an immense challenge. We recently presented the thromboSeq pipeline, which enables RNA sequencing and cancer classification via self-learning and swarm intelligence–enhanced bioinformatics algorithms using blood platelet RNA. Here, we provide the wet-lab protocol for the generation of platelet RNA-sequencing libraries and the dry-lab protocol for the development of swarm intelligence–enhanced machine-learning-based classification algorithms. The wet-lab protocol includes platelet RNA isolation, mRNA amplification, and preparation for next-generation sequencing. The dry-lab protocol describes the automated FASTQ file pre-processing to quantified gene counts, quality controls, data normalization and correction, and swarm intelligence–enhanced support vector machine (SVM) algorithm development. This protocol enables platelet RNA profiling from 500 pg of platelet RNA and allows automated and optimized biomarker panel selection. The wet-lab protocol can be performed in 5 d before sequencing, and the algorithm development can be completed in 2 d, depending on computational resources. The protocol requires basic molecular biology skills and a basic understanding of Linux and R. In all, with this protocol, we aim to enable the scientific community to test platelet RNA for diagnostic algorithm development. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

AB  - Dioecy has evolved recently and independently from cosexual populations in many angiosperm lineages, providing opportunities to understand the evolutionary process underlying this transition. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is a dioecious plant with homomorphic sex chromosomes (XY). Although most of the spinach Y chromosome recombines with the X chromosome, a region around the male-determining locus on Y does not recombine with its X counterpart, suggesting that this region might be related to the evolution of dioecy in the species. To identify genes located in the non-recombining region (MSY, male-specific region of Y), RNA-seq analysis of male and female progeny plants (eight each) from a sib-cross of a dioecious line was performed. We discovered only 354 sex-chromosomal SNPs in 219 transcript sequences (genes). We randomly selected 39 sex-chromosomal genes to examine the reproducibility of the RNA-seq results and observed tight linkage to the male-determining locus in a spinach segregating population (140 individuals). Further analysis using a large-scale population (>1400) and over 100 spinach germplasm accessions and cultivars showed that SNPs in at least 12 genes are fully linked to the male-determining locus, suggesting that the genes reside in the spinach MSY. Synonymous substitution rates of the MSY genes and X homologues predict a recent divergence (0.40 ± 0.08 Mya). Furthermore, synonymous divergence between spinach and its wild relative (S. tetrandra), whose sex chromosomes (XY) originated from a common ancestral chromosome, predicted that the species diverged around 5.7 Mya. Assuming that dioecy in Spinacia evolved before speciation within the genus and has a monophyletic origin, our data suggest that recombination around the spinach sex-determining locus might have stopped significantly later than the evolution of dioecy in Spinacia. © 2019 Okazaki et al.

AB  - A mechanistic understanding of evolutionary developmental biology requires the development of novel techniques for the manipulation of gene function in phylogenetically diverse organismal systems. Recently, gene-specific knockdown by microinjection of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was applied in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, demonstrating that the shRNA approach can be used for efficient and robust sequence-specific knockdown of a gene of interest. However, the time- and labor-intensive process of microinjection limits access to this technique and its application in large scale experiments. To address this issue, here we present an electroporation protocol for shRNA delivery into Nematostella eggs. This method leverages the speed and simplicity of electroporation, enabling users to manipulate gene expression in hundreds of eggs or embryos within minutes. We provide a detailed description of the experimental procedure, including reagents, electroporation conditions, preparation of Nematostella eggs, and follow-up care of experimental animals. Finally, we demonstrate the knockdown of several endogenous and exogenous genes with known phenotypes and discuss the potential applications of this method. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Aim: The methylome associated with miRNA loci was investigated in oral cancer to explore tobacco specific methylation and potential biomarkers for patient survival. Methods: Methylome data was generated from 16 pairs of cancer-normal tissues by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing method. Differentially methylated regions were identified using the DMAP pipeline. In silico validation and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed on The Cancer Genome Atlas data based on our miRNA methylome data. Results: A total of 4310 unique differentially methylated regions, mapping to 144 miRNA loci, were identified. Three distinct groups of miRNAs were differentially methylated in cancer tissues from smokers, chewers and mixed habitués. Hypermethylation of miR-503, miR-200a/b, miR-320b and miR-489 was associated with worse 5-year survival. Conclusion: Differential methylation patterns in miRNA loci are associated with poor survival underscoring their potential as predictive and prognostic biomarkers in oral cancer. © 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - Background: As an important biomass raw material, the lignocellulose in bamboo is of significant value in energy conversion. The conversion of bamboo lignocellulose into fermentable reducing sugar, i.e. the degradation of bamboo lignocellulose, is an important step in lignocellulose conversion. However, little research has focussed on excavating the enzymes and microbes that are related to the degradation of bamboo lignocellulose, which is important for its utilisation. This study used Cyrtotrachelus buqueti (bamboo snout beetle) to evaluate the efficiency of bamboo lignocellulose degradation. Results: RNA sequencing was conducted to sequence the transcriptome of the insect before and after feeding on bamboo shoots. The expression levels of genes encoding several carbohydrate-active enzymes, such as endoglucanase (evgtrinloc27093t1 and evgtrinloc16407t0) and laccase (evgtrinloc15173t0 and evgtrinloc11252t0), were found to be upregulated after feeding. Faecal component analysis showed that the degradation efficiencies of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were 61.82%, 87.65% and 69.05%, respectively. After 6 days of co-culture with crude enzymes in vitro, the degradation efficiencies of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in bamboo shoot particles (BSPs) were 24.98%, 37.52% and 26.67%, respectively. These results indicated that lignocellulosic enzymes and related enzymes within the insect itself co-degraded bamboo lignocellulose. These finding can potentially be used for the pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of bamboo lignocellulose. Conclusion: Our results showed that intestinal digestive enzymes from C. buqueti degraded bamboo shoot lignocellulose both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the expression levels of many carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes were upregulated in the transcriptome, including those for cellulase, xylanase and ligninase genes. Therefore, we proposed a scheme for applying the lignocellulolytic enzymes from C. buqueti to degrade bamboo lignocellulose using genetic, enzymatic and fermentation engineering techniques to overexpress the lignocellulolytic enzymes genes in vitro and obtain large quantities of enzymes that could efficiently degrade bamboo lignocellulose and be used for lignocellulose bioconversion. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Rapid advances in genomic technologies have facilitated the identification pathogenic variants causing human disease. We report siblings with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy due to a novel, shared heterozygous pathogenic 13 bp duplication in SYNGAP1 (c.435_447dup, p.(L150Vfs*6)) that was identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS). The pathogenic variant had escaped earlier detection via two methodologies: whole exome sequencing and high-depth targeted sequencing. Both technologies had produced reads carrying the variant, however, they were either not aligned due to the size of the insertion or aligned to multiple major histocompatibility complex (MHC) regions in the hg19 reference genome, making the critical reads unavailable for variant calling. The WGS pipeline followed different protocols, including alignment of reads to the GRCh37 reference genome, which lacks the additional MHC contigs. Our findings highlight the benefit of using orthogonal clinical bioinformatic pipelines and all relevant inheritance patterns to re-analyze genomic data in undiagnosed patients. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Background: The last 10 years have seen the rise of countless functional genomics studies based on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). In the vast majority of cases, whatever the species, whatever the experiment, the two first steps of data analysis consist of a quality control of the raw reads followed by a mapping of those reads to a reference genome/transcriptome. Subsequent steps then depend on the type of study that is being made. While some tools have been proposed for investigating data quality after the mapping step, there is no commonly adopted framework that would be easy to use and broadly applicable to any NGS data type. Results: We present ALFA, a simple but universal tool that can be used after the mapping step on any kind of NGS experiment data for any organism with available genomic annotations. In a single command line, ALFA can compute and display distribution of reads by categories (exon, intron, UTR, etc.) and biotypes (protein coding, miRNA, etc.) for a given aligned dataset with nucleotide precision. We present applications of ALFA to Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq on Homo sapiens, CLIP-Seq on Mus musculus, RNA-Seq on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bisulfite sequencing on Arabidopsis thaliana and ChIP-Seq on Caenorhabditis elegans. Conclusions: We show that ALFA provides a powerful and broadly applicable approach for post mapping quality control and to produce a global overview using common or dedicated annotations. It is made available to the community as an easy to install command line tool and from the Galaxy Tool Shed. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Marek's disease virus (MDV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus that can cause T-cell lymphomas in chicken. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is strongly associated with various cancers and many other diseases. In chickens, lncRNAs have not been comprehensively identified. Here, we profiled mRNA and lncRNA repertoires in three groups of spleens from MDV-infected and non-infected chickens, including seven tumorous spleens (TS) from MDV-infected chickens, five spleens from the survivors (SS) without lesions after MDV infection, and five spleens from noninfected chickens (NS), to explore the underlying mechanism of host resistance in Marek's disease (MD). Results: By using a precise lncRNA identification pipeline, we identified 1315 putative lncRNAs and 1166 known lncRNAs in spleen tissue. Genomic features of putative lncRNAs were characterized. Differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, putative lncRNAs, and known lncRNAs were profiled among three groups. We found that several specific intergroup differentially expressed genes were involved in important biological processes and pathways, including B cell activation and the Wnt signaling pathway; some of these genes were also found to be the hub genes in the co-expression network analyzed by WGCNA. Network analysis depicted both intergenic correlation and correlation between genes and MD traits. Five DE lncRNAs including MSTRG.360.1, MSTRG.6725.1, MSTRG.6754.1, MSTRG.15539.1, and MSTRG.7747.5 strongly correlated with MD-resistant candidate genes, such as IGF-I, CTLA4, HDAC9, SWAP70, CD72, JCHAIN, CXCL12, and CD8B, suggesting that lncRNAs may affect MD resistance and tumorigenesis in chicken spleens through their target genes. Conclusions: Our results provide both transcriptomic and epigenetic insights on MD resistance and its pathological mechanism. The comprehensive lncRNA and mRNA transcriptomes in MDV-infected chicken spleens were profiled. Co-expression analysis identified integrated lncRNA-mRNA and gene-gene interaction networks, implying that hub genes or lncRNAs exert critical influence on MD resistance and tumorigenesis. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - We introduce alevin, a fast end-to-end pipeline to process droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing data, performing cell barcode detection, read mapping, unique molecular identifier (UMI) deduplication, gene count estimation, and cell barcode whitelisting. Alevin's approach to UMI deduplication considers transcript-level constraints on the molecules from which UMIs may have arisen and accounts for both gene-unique reads and reads that multimap between genes. This addresses the inherent bias in existing tools which discard gene-ambiguous reads and improves the accuracy of gene abundance estimates. Alevin is considerably faster, typically eight times, than existing gene quantification approaches, while also using less memory. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: RNA-Seq technology is routinely used to characterize the transcriptome, and to detect gene expression differences among cell types, genotypes and conditions. Advances in short-read sequencing instruments such as Illumina Next-Seq have yielded easy-to-operate machines, with high throughput, at a lower price per base. However, processing this data requires bioinformatics expertise to tailor and execute specific solutions for each type of library preparation. Results: In order to enable fast and user-friendly data analysis, we developed an intuitive and scalable transcriptome pipeline that executes the full process, starting from cDNA sequences derived by RNA-Seq [Nat Rev Genet 10:57-63, 2009] and bulk MARS-Seq [Science 343:776-779, 2014] and ending with sets of differentially expressed genes. Output files are placed in structured folders, and results summaries are provided in rich and comprehensive reports, containing dozens of plots, tables and links. Conclusion: Our User-friendly Transcriptome Analysis Pipeline (UTAP) is an open source, web-based intuitive platform available to the biomedical research community, enabling researchers to efficiently and accurately analyse transcriptome sequence data. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - RNA editing is a widespread co/posttranscriptional mechanism affecting primary RNAs by specific nucleotide modifications, which plays relevant roles in molecular processes including regulation of gene expression and/or the processing of noncoding RNAs. In recent years, the detection of editing sites has been improved through the availability of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technologies. Accurate bioinformatics pipelines are essential for the analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data to ensure the correct identification of edited sites. Several pipelines, using various read mappers and variant callers with a wide range of adjustable parameters, are available for the detection of RNA editing events. In this review, we discuss some of the most recent and popular tools and provide guidelines for RNA-Seq data generation and analysis for the detection of RNA editing in massive transcriptome data. Using simulated and real data sets, we provide an overview of their behavior, emphasizing the fact that the RNA editing detection in NGS data sets remains a challenging task. © 2017 The Author.

AB  - Over the last few years, RNA-seq has been used to study alterations in alternative splicing related to several diseases. Bioinformatics workflows used to perform these studies can be divided into two groups, those finding changes in the absolute isoform expression and those studying differential splicing. Many computational methods for transcriptomics analysis have been developed, evaluated and compared; however, there are not enough reports of systematic and objective assessment of processing pipelines as a whole. Moreover, comparative studies have been performed considering separately the changes in absolute or relative isoform expression levels. Consequently, no consensus exists about the best practices and appropriate workflows to analyse alternative and differential splicing. To assist the adequate pipeline choice, we present here a benchmarking of nine commonly used workflows to detect differential isoform expression and splicing. We evaluated the workflows performance over different experimental scenarios where changes in absolute and relative isoform expression occurred simultaneously. In addition, the effect of the number of isoforms per gene, and the magnitude of the expression change over pipeline performances were also evaluated. Our results suggest that workflow performance is influenced by the number of replicates per condition and the conditions heterogeneity. In general, workflows based on DESeq2, DEXSeq, Limma and NOISeq performed well over a wide range of transcriptomics experiments. In particular, we suggest the use of workflows based on Limma when high precision is required, and DESeq2 and DEXseq pipelines to prioritize sensitivity. When several replicates per condition are available, NOISeq and Limma pipelines are indicated. © 2017 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Yap et al. perform in vitro differentiation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells to cardiovascular progenitors using laminin-221 as a culture matrix in a fully human and chemically defined protocol. Use of these cells for in vivo cardiac regeneration and to generate human heart muscle bundles results in improved heart function. © 2019 The Author(s)
Regeneration of injured human heart muscle is limited and an unmet clinical need. There are no methods for the reproducible generation of clinical-quality stem cell-derived cardiovascular progenitors (CVPs). We identified laminin-221 (LN-221) as the most likely expressed cardiac laminin. We produced it as human recombinant protein and showed that LN-221 promotes differentiation of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) toward cardiomyocyte lineage and downregulates pluripotency and teratoma-associated genes. We developed a chemically defined, xeno-free laminin-based differentiation protocol to generate CVPs. We show high reproducibility of the differentiation protocol using time-course bulk RNA sequencing developed from different hESC lines. Single-cell RNA sequencing of CVPs derived from hESC lines supported reproducibility and identified three main progenitor subpopulations. These CVPs were transplanted into myocardial infarction mice, where heart function was measured by echocardiogram and human heart muscle bundle formation was identified histologically. This method may provide clinical-quality cells for use in regenerative cardiology. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - In the bone marrow, CXCL12 and IL-7 are essential for B cell differentiation, whereas hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance requires SCF and CXCL12. Peri-sinusoidal stromal (PSS) cells are the main source of IL-7, but their characterization as a pro-B cell niche remains limited. Here, we characterize pro-B cell supporting stromal cells and decipher the interaction network allowing pro-B cell retention. Preferential contacts are found between pro-B cells and PSS cells, which homogeneously express HSC and B cell niche genes. Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche. Using an interactome bioinformatics pipeline, we identify Nidogen-1 as essential for pro-B cell retention in the peri-sinusoidal niche as confirmed in Nidogen-1 −/− mice. Finally, human pro-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors are observed close to similar IL-7 + stromal cells. Thus, a multispecific niche exists in mouse and human supporting both early progenitors and committed hematopoietic lineages. © 2019 The Author(s)
Balzano et al. show that bone marrow peri-sinusoidal stromal cells, which form the hematopoietic stem cell niche, also express B cell niche genes including IL-7 and Nidogen-1. Loss of Nidogen-1 expression specifically affects access of pro-B cells to IL-7, resulting in impaired expansion and differentiation of early B cells. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - Transposable elements (TEs) are interspersed repeat sequences that make up much of the human genome. Their expression has been implicated in development and disease. However, TE-derived RNA-seq reads are difficult to quantify. Past approaches have excluded these reads or aggregated RNA expression to subfamilies shared by similar TE copies, sacrificing quantitative accuracy or the genomic context necessary to understand the basis of TE transcription. As a result, the effects of TEs on gene expression and associated phenotypes are not well understood. Here, we present Software for Quantifying Interspersed Repeat Expression (SQuIRE), the first RNA-seq analysis pipeline that provides a quantitative and locus-specific picture of TE expression (https://github.com/wyang17/SQuIRE). SQuIRE is an accurate and user-friendly tool that can be used for a variety of species. We applied SQuIRE to RNA-seq from normal mouse tissues and a Drosophila model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In both model organisms, we recapitulated previously reported TE subfamily expression levels and revealed locus-specific TE expression. We also identified differences in TE transcription patterns relating to transcript type, gene expression and RNA splicing that would be lost with other approaches using subfamily-level analyses. Altogether, our findings illustrate the importance of studying TE transcription with locus-level resolution. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is an X-linked rare dominant disorder of autophagy. The role of WDR45 has been implicated in BPAN almost exclusively in females possibly due to male lethality. Characterization of distinctive clinical manifestations and potentially the complex genetic determinants in rare male patients remain crucial for deciphering BPAN and other X-linked dominant diseases. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) followed by segregation analysis and identified a novel nonsense and mosaic variant in WDR45, namely NM_007075.3:c.873C>G; p.(Tyr291*) in an affected male at the age of 34. His biphasic medical history was compatible with BPAN, which was characterized by delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, and progression into dystonia parkinsonism in his twenties. The variant had an apparently mosaic pattern both in whole exome and Sanger sequencing findings. In order to figure out if mosaicism was restricted to this variant or related to a chromosomal level mosaicism, we used our in-house WES data from 129 unrelated individuals to calculate the threshold values of male and female X chromosome heterozygosity (XcHet) in WES data for our pipeline. A background level of heterozygous variants on X chromosome excluding the pseudoautosomal loci is an observed phenomenon in WES analysis and this level has been used as a quality measure. Herein, we suggest utilization of this measure for detection of digital anomalies of the X chromosome in males by potentially observing a higher XcHet value than the threshold value. This approach has revealed a variant level mosaicism in the affected male, which was further supported with cytogenetic analyses. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: Differential expression (DE) is a fundamental step in the analysis of RNA-Seq count data. We had previously developed an R/Bioconductor package (called TCC) for this purpose. While this package has the unique feature of an in-built robust normalization method, its use has so far been limited to R users only. There is thus, a need for an alternative to DE analysis by TCC for non-R users. Results: Here, we present a graphical user interface for TCC (called TCC-GUI). Non-R users only need a web browser as the minimum requirement for its use (https://infinityloop.shinyapps.io/TCC-GUI/). TCC-GUI is implemented in R and encapsulated in Shiny application. It contains all the major functionalities of TCC, including DE pipelines with robust normalization and simulation data generation under various conditions. It also contains (i) tools for exploratory analysis, including a useful score termed average silhouette that measures the degree of separation of compared groups, (ii) visualization tools such as volcano plot and heatmap with hierarchical clustering, and (iii) a reporting tool using R Markdown. By virtue of the Shiny-based GUI framework, users can obtain results simply by mouse navigation. The source code for TCC-GUI is available at https://github.com/swsoyee/TCC-GUI under MIT license. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Alternative splicing plays an important role in numerous cellular processes and aberrant splice decisions are associated with cancer. Although some studies point to a regulation of alternative splicing and its effector mechanisms in a time-dependent manner, the extent and consequences of such a regulation remains poorly understood. In the present work, we investigated the time-dependent production of isoforms in two Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines of different progression stages (HD-MY-Z, stage IIIb and L-1236, stage IV) compared to a B lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL-HO) with a focus on tumour necrosis factor (TNF) pathway-related elements. For this, we used newly generated time-course RNA-sequencing data from the mentioned cell lines and applied a computational pipeline to identify genes with isoform-switching behaviour in time. We analysed the temporal profiles of the identified events and evaluated in detail the potential functional implications of alterations in isoform expression for the selected top-switching genes. Our data indicate that elements within the TNF pathway undergo a time-dependent variation in isoform production with a putative impact on cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis. These include the genes TRAF1, TNFRSF12A and NFKB2. Our results point to a role of temporal alternative splicing in isoform production, which may alter the outcome of the TNF pathway and impact on tumorigenesis.

AB  - Background: RNA-seq, wherein RNA transcripts expressed in a sample are sequenced and quantified, has become a widely used technique to study disease and development. With RNA-seq, transcription abundance can be measured, differential expression genes between groups and functional enrichment of those genes can be computed. However, biological insights from RNA-seq are often limited by computational analysis and the enormous volume of resulting data, preventing facile and meaningful review and interpretation of gene expression profiles. Particularly, in cases where the samples under study exhibit uncontrolled variation, deeper analysis of functional enrichment would be necessary to visualize samples' gene expression activity under each biological function. Results: We developed a Bioconductor package rgsepd that streamlines RNA-seq data analysis by wrapping commonly used tools DESeq2 and GOSeq in a user-friendly interface and performs a gene-subset linear projection to cluster heterogeneous samples by Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Rgsepd computes significantly enriched GO terms for each experimental condition and generates multidimensional projection plots highlighting how each predefined gene set's multidimensional expression may delineate samples. Conclusions: The rgsepd serves to automate differential expression, functional annotation, and exploratory data analyses to highlight subtle expression differences among samples based on each significant biological function. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The use of microarrays and RNA-seq technologies is ubiquitous for transcriptome analyses in modern biology. With proper analysis tools, the differential gene expression analysis process can be significantly accelerated. Many open-source programs provide cutting-edge techniques, but these often require programming skills and lack intuitive and interactive or graphical user interfaces. To avoid bottlenecks impeding seamless analysis processing, we have developed an Interactive Gene Expression Analysis Kit, we term iGEAK, focusing on usability and interactivity. iGEAK is designed to be a simple, intuitive, light-weight that contrasts with heavy-duty programs. Results: iGEAK is an R/Shiny-based client-side desktop application, providing an interactive gene expression data analysis pipeline for microarray and RNA-seq data. Gene expression data can be intuitively explored using a seamless analysis pipeline consisting of sample selection, differentially expressed gene prediction, protein-protein interaction, and gene set enrichment analyses. For each analysis step, users can easily alter parameters to mine more relevant biological information. Conclusion: iGEAK is the outcome of close collaboration with wet-bench biologists who are eager to easily explore, mine, and analyze new or public microarray and RNA-seq data. We designed iGEAK as a gene expression analysis pipeline tool to provide essential analysis steps and a user-friendly interactive graphical user interface. iGEAK enables users without programing knowledge to comfortably perform differential gene expression predictions and downstream analyses. iGEAK packages, manuals, tutorials, sample datasets are available at the iGEAK project homepage (https://sites.google.com/view/iGEAK). © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: High-throughput sequencing often provides a foundation for experimental analyses in the life sciences. For many such methods, an intermediate layer of bioinformatics data analysis is the genomic signal track constructed by short read mapping to a particular genome assembly. There are many software tools to visualize genomic tracks in a web browser or with a stand-alone graphical user interface. However, there are only few command-line applications suitable for automated usage or production of publication-ready visualizations. Results: Here we present svist4get, a command-line tool for customizable generation of publication-quality figures based on data from genomic signal tracks. Similarly to generic genome browser software, svist4get visualizes signal tracks at a given genomic location and is able to aggregate data from several tracks on a single plot along with the transcriptome annotation. The resulting plots can be saved as the vector or high-resolution bitmap images. We demonstrate practical use cases of svist4get for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq data. Conclusions: svist4get is implemented in Python 3 and runs on Linux. The command-line interface of svist4get allows for easy integration into bioinformatics pipelines in a console environment. Extra customization is possible through configuration files and Python API. For convenience, svist4get is provided as pypi package.

AB  - Background: Existing tools for the aggregation and visualization of differential expression data have discrete functionality and require that end-users rely on multiple software packages with complex dependencies or manually manipulate data for analysis and interpretation. Furthermore, at present, data aggregation and visualization are laborious, time consuming, and subject to human error. This is a serious limitation on the current state of differential transcriptomic analysis, which makes it necessary to expend extensive time and resources to reach the point where biological meaning can be interpreted. Such an approach for analysis also leads to scattered and non-standardized code, unsystematic project management and non-reproducible result sets. Results: Here, we present a differential expression analysis toolkit, DEvis, that provides a powerful, integrated solution for the analysis of differential expression data with a rapid turnaround time. DEvis has simple installation requirements and provides a convenient, user-friendly R package that addresses the issues inherent to complex multi-factor experiments, such as multiple contrast aggregation and integration, result sorting and selection, visualization, project management, and reproducibility. This tool increases the capabilities of differential expression analysis while reducing workload and the potential for manual error. Furthermore, it provides a much-needed encapsulation of scattered functionality, making large and complex analysis more efficient and reproducible. Conclusion: DEvis provides a wide range of powerful visualization, data aggregation, and project management tools that provide flexibility and speed in analysis. The functionality provided by DEVis increases efficiency of analysis and supplies researchers with new and relevant means for the analysis of large and complicated transcriptomic experiments. DEvis furthermore incorporates automatic project management capabilities, which standardizes analysis and ensures the reproducibility of results. After the establishment of statistical frameworks that identify differentially expressed genes, this package is the next logical step for differential transcriptomic analysis, establishing the critical framework necessary to manipulate, explore, and extract biologically relevant meaning from differential expression data. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq, currently dominate genome-wide gene expression studies. A standard approach to analyse this data requires mapping sequence reads to a reference and counting the number of reads which map to each gene. However, for many transcriptome studies, a suitable reference genome is unavailable, especially for meta-transcriptome studies which assay gene expression from mixed populations of organisms. Where a reference is unavailable, it is possible to generate a reference by the de novo assembly of the sequence reads. However, the high cost of generating high-coverage data for de novo assembly hinders this approach and more importantly the accurate assembly of such data is challenging, especially for meta-transcriptome data, and resulting assemblies frequently suffer from collapsed regions or chimeric sequences. As an alternative to the standard reference mapping approach, we have developed a k-mer-based analysis pipeline (DiffKAP) to identify differentially expressed reads between RNA-Seq datasets without the requirement for a reference. We compared the DiffKAP approach with the traditional Tophat/Cuffdiff method using RNA-Seq data from soybean, which has a suitable reference genome. We subsequently examined differential gene expression for a coral meta-transcriptome where no reference is available, and validated the results using qRT-PCR. We conclude that DiffKAP is an accurate method to study differential gene expression in complex meta-transcriptomes without the requirement of a reference genome. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - High-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies have led to a rapid increase in the number of sequence variants identified in clinical practice via diagnostic genetic tests. Current bioinformatic analysis pipelines fail to take adequate account of the possible splicing effects of such variants, particularly where variants fall outwith canonical splice site sequences, and consequently the pathogenicity of such variants may often be missed. The regulation of splicing is highly complex and as a result, in silico prediction tools lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for reliable use. Variants of all kinds can be linked to aberrant splicing in disease and the need for correct identification and diagnosis grows ever more crucial as novel splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide therapies start to enter clinical usage. RT-PCR provides a useful targeted assay of the splicing effects of identified variants, while minigene assays, massive parallel reporter assays and animal models can also be used for more detailed study of a particular splicing system, given enough time and resources. However, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has the potential to be used as a rapid diagnostic tool in genomic medicine. By utilising data science approaches and machine learning, it may prove possible to finally understand and interpret the 'splicing code’ and apply this knowledge in human disease diagnostics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The heart responds to hemodynamic overload through cardiac hypertrophy and activation of the fetal gene program. However, these changes have not been thoroughly examined in individual cardiomyocytes, and the relation between cardiomyocyte size and fetal gene expression remains elusive. We established a method of high-throughput single-molecule RNA imaging analysis of in vivo cardiomyocytes and determined spatial and temporal changes during the development of heart failure. Methods and results: We applied three novel single-cell analysis methods, namely, single-cell quantitative PCR (sc-qPCR), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). Isolated cardiomyocytes and cross sections from pressure overloaded murine hearts after transverse aortic constriction (TAC) were analyzed at an early hypertrophy stage (2 weeks, TAC2W) and at a late heart failure stage (8 weeks, TAC8W). Expression of myosin heavy chain β (Myh7), a representative fetal gene, was induced in some cardiomyocytes in TAC2W hearts and in more cardiomyocytes in TAC8W hearts. Expression levels of Myh7 varied considerably among cardiomyocytes. Myh7-expressing cardiomyocytes were significantly more abundant in the middle layer, compared with the inner or outer layers of TAC2W hearts, while such spatial differences were not observed in TAC8W hearts. Expression levels of Myh7 were inversely correlated with cardiomyocyte size and expression levels of mitochondria-related genes. Conclusions: We developed a new image-analysis pipeline to allow automated and unbiased quantification of gene expression at the single-cell level and determined the spatial and temporal regulation of heterogenous Myh7 expression in cardiomyocytes after pressure overload. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The availability of low-cost small-factor sequencers, such as the Illumina MiSeq, MiniSeq, or iSeq, have paved the way for democratizing genomics sequencing, providing researchers in minority universities with access to the technology that was previously only affordable by institutions with large core facilities. However, these instruments are not bundled with software for performing bioinformatics data analysis, and the data analysis can be the main bottleneck for independent laboratories or even small clinical facilities that consider adopting genomic sequencing for medical applications. To address this issue, we have developed miCloud, a bioinformatics platform that enables genomic data analysis through a fully featured data analysis cloud, which seamlessly integrates with genome sequencers over the local network. The miCloud can be easily deployed without any prior bioinformatics expertise on any computing environment, from a laboratory computer workstation to a university computer cluster. Our platform not only provides access to a set of preconfigured RNA-Seq and CHIP-Seq bioinformatics pipelines, but also enables users to develop or install new preconfigured tools from the large selection available on open-source online Docker container repositories. The miCloud built-in analysis pipelines are also integrated with the Visual Omics Explorer framework (Kim et al., 2016), which provides rich interactive visualizations and publication-ready graphics from the next-generation sequencing data. Ultimately, the miCloud demonstrates a bioinformatics approach that can be adopted in the field for standardizing genomic data analysis, similarly to the way molecular biology sample preparation kits have standardized laboratory operations. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.

AB  - RNA cytosine-5 methylation (m 5 C) has emerged as a key epitranscriptomic mark, which fulfills multiple roles in structural modulation, stress signaling and the regulation of protein translation. Bisulfite sequencing is currently the most accurate and reliable method to detect m 5 C marks at nucleotide resolution. Targeted bisulfite sequencing allows m 5 C detection at single base resolution, by combining the use of tailored primers with bisulfite treatment. A number of computational tools currently exist to analyse m 5 C marks in DNA bisulfite sequencing. However, these methods are not directly applicable to the analysis of RNA m 5 C marks, because DNA analysis focuses on CpG methylation, and because artifactual unconversion and misamplification in RNA can obscure actual methylation signals. We describe a pipeline designed specifically for RNA cytosine-5 methylation analysis in targeted bisulfite sequencing experiments. The pipeline is directly applicable to Illumina MiSeq (or equivalent) sequencing datasets using a web interface (https://bisamp.dkfz.de), and is defined by optimized mapping parameters and the application of tailored filters for the removal of artifacts. We provide examples for the application of this pipeline in the unambiguous detection of m 5 C marks in tRNAs from mouse embryonic stem cells and neuron-differentiated stem cells as well as in 28S rRNA from human fibroblasts. Finally, we also discuss the adaptability of BisAMP to the analysis of DNA methylation. Our pipeline provides an accurate, fast and user-friendly framework for the analysis of cytosine-5 methylation in amplicons from bisulfite-treated RNA. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: Basic parameters commonly used to describe genomes including length, weight and relative guanine-cytosine (GC) content are widely cited in absence of a primary source. By using updated data and original software we determined these values to the best of our knowledge as standard reference for the whole human nuclear genome, for each chromosome and for mitochondrial DNA. We also devised a method to calculate the relative GC content in the whole messenger RNA sequence set and in transcriptomes by multiplying the GC content of each gene by its mean expression level. Results: The male nuclear diploid genome extends for 6.27 Gigabase pairs (Gbp), is 205.00 cm (cm) long and weighs 6.41 picograms (pg). Female values are 6.37 Gbp, 208.23 cm, 6.51 pg. The individual variability and the implication for the DNA informational density in terms of bits/volume were discussed. The genomic GC content is 40.9%. Following analysis in different transcriptomes and species, we showed that the greatest deviation was observed in the pathological condition analysed (trisomy 21 leukaemic cells) and in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results may represent a solid basis for further investigation on human structural and functional genomics while also providing a framework for other genome comparative analysis. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) is a powerful method to examine chromatin accessibility. While many studies have reported a positive correlation between gene expression and promoter accessibility, few have investigated the genes that deviate from this trend. In this study, we aimed to understand the relationship between gene expression and promoter accessibility in multiple cell types while also identifying gene regulatory networks in the placenta, an understudied organ that is critical for a successful pregnancy. Results: We started by assaying the open chromatin landscape in the mid-gestation placenta, when the fetal vasculature has started developing. After incorporating transcriptomic data generated in the placenta at the same time point, we grouped genes based on their expression levels and ATAC-seq promoter coverage. We found that the genes with the strongest correlation (high expression and high coverage) are likely involved in housekeeping functions, whereas tissue-specific genes were highly expressed and had only medium-low coverage. We also predicted that genes with medium-low expression and high promoter coverage were actively repressed. Within this group, we extracted a protein-protein interaction network enriched for neuronal functions, likely preventing the cells from adopting a neuronal fate. We further confirmed that a repressive histone mark is bound to the promoters of genes in this network. Finally, we ran our pipeline using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data generated in ten additional cell types. We again found that genes with the strongest correlation are enriched for housekeeping functions and that genes with medium-low promoter coverage and high expression are more likely to be tissue-specific. These results demonstrate that only two data types, both of which require relatively low starting material to generate and are becoming more commonly available, can be integrated to understand multiple aspects of gene regulation. Conclusions: Within the placenta, we identified an active placenta-specific gene network as well as a repressed neuronal network. Beyond the placenta, we demonstrate that ATAC-seq data and RNA-seq data can be integrated to identify tissue-specific genes and actively repressed gene networks in multiple cell types. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Backgrounds: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is now widely used in biomedical research for various applications. Processing of NGS data requires multiple programs and customization of the processing pipelines according to the data platforms. However, rapid progress of the NGS applications and processing methods urgently require prompt update of the pipelines. Recent clinical applications of NGS technology such as cell-free DNA, cancer panel, or exosomal RNA sequencing data also require appropriate customization of the processing pipelines. Here, we developed SEQprocess, a highly extendable framework that can provide standard as well as customized pipelines for NGS data processing. Results: SEQprocess was implemented in an R package with fully modularized steps for data processing that can be easily customized. Currently, six pre-customized pipelines are provided that can be easily executed by non-experts such as biomedical scientists, including the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) pipelines as well as the popularly used pipelines for variant calling (e.g., GATK) and estimation of allele frequency, RNA abundance (e.g., TopHat2/Cufflink), or DNA copy numbers (e.g., Sequenza). In addition, optimized pipelines for the clinical sequencing from cell-free DNA or miR-Seq are also provided. The processed data were transformed into R package-compatible data type 'ExpressionSet' or 'SummarizedExperiment', which could facilitate subsequent data analysis within R environment. Finally, an automated report summarizing the processing steps are also provided to ensure reproducibility of the NGS data analysis. Conclusion: SEQprocess provides a highly extendable and R compatible framework that can manage customized and reproducible pipelines for handling multiple legacy NGS processing tools. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The use of RNA-seq as a generalized tool to measure the differential expression of genes has essentially replaced the use of the microarray. Despite the acknowledged technical advantages to this approach, RNA-seq library preparation remains mostly conducted by core facilities rather than in the laboratory due to the infrastructure, expertise and time required per sample. We have recently described two ‘click-chemistry’ based library construction methods termed ClickSeq and Poly(A)-ClickSeq (PAC-seq) as alternatives to conventional RNA-seq that are both cost effective and rely on straightforward reagents readily available to most labs. ClickSeq is random-primed and can sequence any (unfragmented) RNA template, while PAC-seq is targeted to poly(A) tails of mRNAs. Here, we further develop PAC-seq as a platform that allows for simultaneous mapping of poly(A) sites and the measurement of differential expression of genes. We provide a detailed protocol, descriptions of appropriate computational pipelines, and a proof-of-principle dataset to illustrate the technique. PAC-seq offers a unique advantage over other 3′ end mapping protocols in that it does not require additional purification, selection, or fragmentation steps allowing sample preparation directly from crude total cellular RNA. We have shown that PAC-seq is able to accurately and sensitively count transcripts for differential gene expression analysis, as well as identify alternative poly(A) sites and determine the precise nucleotides of the poly(A) tail boundaries. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The maternal genome directs almost all aspects of early animal development. As development proceeds, the elimination of maternal gene products and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occur during the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT). To study the molecular mechanisms regulating this developmental event in Eriocheir sinensis, RNA-Seq technology was applied to generate comprehensive information on transcriptome dynamics during early embryonic stages. In total, 32,088 annotated unigenes were obtained from the transcriptomes of fertilized eggs and embryos at the cleavage (2–4 cell) and blastula stage. A total of 566 maternal genes and 1165 zygotic genes were isolated, among which 103 and 266 genes were predicted conserved maternal transcripts (COMATs) and conserved zygotic transcripts (COZYTs), respectively. The COMATs performed housekeeping gene functions and may be essential for initiating early embryogenesis of the Bilateria. Furthermore, 87, 76 and 117 differentially expressed genes associated with the MZT, morphogenesis and immunity were identified when compared the three transcriptomic datasets. We also unmask that the MZT takes place around the cleavage stage, when the genes involved in the clearance of maternal gene products and the ZGA were significantly up-regulated. Taken together, these datasets provide a valuable resource for understanding the mechanisms of early developmental events in E. sinensis, and facilitate further studies on molecular mechanisms of asynchronous development in crabs. © 2018

AB  - Repetitive DNA sequences represent about half of the human genome. They have a central role in human biology, especially neurobiology, but are notoriously difficult to study. The purpose of this study was to quantify the transcription from repetitive sequences in a progerin-expressing cellular model of neuronal aging. Progerin is a nuclear protein causative of the Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome that is also incrementally expressed during the normal aging process. A dedicated pipeline of analysis allowed to quantify transcripts containing repetitive sequences from RNAseq datasets oblivious of their genomic localization, tolerating a sufficient degree of mutational noise, all with low computational requirements. The pipeline has been applied to a published panel of RNAseq datasets derived from a well-established and well-described cellular model of aging of dopaminergic neurons. Progerin expression strongly downregulated the transcription from all the classes of repetitive sequences: satellites, long and short interspersed nuclear elements, human endogenous retroviruses, and DNA transposon. The Alu element represented by far the principal source of transcript originating either from repetitive sequences or from canonical coding genes; it was expressed on average at 192,493.5 reads per kilobase million (RPKM) (SE = 21,081.3) in the control neurons and dropped to 43,760.1 RPKM (SE = 5315.0) in the progerin-expressing neurons, being significant downregulated (p = 0.0005). The results highlighted a global perturbation of transcripts derived from repetitive sequences in a cellular model of aging and provided a direct link between progerin expression and alteration of transcription from human repetitive elements. © 2019, American Aging Association.

AB  - Background: Genetically engineered mice (GEM) are essential tools for understanding gene function and disease modeling. Historically, gene targeting was first done in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the 129 family of inbred strains, leading to a mixed background or congenic mice when crossed with C57BL/6 mice. Depending on the number of backcrosses and breeding strategies, genomic segments from 129-derived ESCs can be introgressed into the C57BL/6 genome, establishing a unique genetic makeup that needs characterization in order to obtain valid conclusions from experiments using GEM lines. Currently, SNP genotyping is used to detect the extent of 129-derived ESC genome introgression into C57BL/6 recipients; however, it fails to detect novel/rare variants. Results: Here, we present a computational pipeline implemented in the Galaxy platform and in BASH/R script to determine genetic introgression of GEM using next generation sequencing data (NGS), such as whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq. The pipeline includes strategies to uncover variants linked to a targeted locus, genome-wide variant visualization, and the identification of potential modifier genes. Although these methods apply to congenic mice, they can also be used to describe variants fixed by genetic drift. As a proof of principle, we analyzed publicly available RNA-Seq data from five congenic knockout (KO) lines and our own RNA-Seq data from the Sall2 KO line. Additionally, we performed target validation using several genetics approaches. Conclusions: We revealed the impact of the 129-derived ESC genome introgression on gene expression, predicted potential modifier genes, and identified potential phenotypic interference in KO lines. Our results demonstrate that our new approach is an effective method to determine genetic introgression of GEM. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Tyler et al. create PyMINEr, an open-source program (https://www.sciencescott.com/pyminer) that automates analyses of expression datasets without coding.

Toolsets available for in-depth analysis of scRNA-seq datasets by biologists with little informatics experience is limited. Here, we describe an informatics tool (PyMINEr) that fully automates cell type identification, cell type-specific pathway analyses, graph theory-based analysis of gene regulation, and detection of autocrine-paracrine signaling networks in silico. We applied PyMINEr to interrogate human pancreatic islet scRNA-seq datasets and discovered several features of co-expression graphs, including concordance of scRNA-seq-graph structure with both protein-protein interactions and 3D genomic architecture, association of high-connectivity and low-expression genes with cell type enrichment, and potential for the graph structure to clarify potential etiologies of enigmatic disease-associated variants. We further created a consensus co-expression network and autocrine-paracrine signaling networks within and across islet cell types from seven datasets. PyMINEr correctly identified changes in BMP-WNT signaling associated with cystic fibrosis pancreatic acinar cell loss. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that the PyMINEr framework will be a valuable resource for scRNA-seq analyses. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - Objective To uncover the microRNA (miRNA) interactome of the osteoarthritis (OA) pathophysiological process in the cartilage. Methods We performed RNA sequencing in 130 samples (n=35 and n=30 pairs for messenger RNA (mRNA) and miRNA, respectively) on macroscopically preserved and lesioned OA cartilage from the same patient and performed differential expression (DE) analysis of miRNA and mRNAs. To build an OA-specific miRNA interactome, a prioritisation scheme was applied based on inverse Pearson's correlations and inverse DE of miRNAs and mRNAs. Subsequently, these were filtered by those present in predicted (TargetScan/microT-CDS) and/or experimentally validated (miRTarBase/TarBase) public databases. Pathway enrichment analysis was applied to elucidate OA-related pathways likely mediated by miRNA regulatory mechanisms. Results We found 142 miRNAs and 2387 mRNAs to be differentially expressed between lesioned and preserved OA articular cartilage. After applying prioritisation towards likely miRNA-mRNA targets, a regulatory network of 62 miRNAs targeting 238 mRNAs was created. Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis of these mRNAs (or genes) elucidated that genes within the 'nervous system development' are likely mediated by miRNA regulatory mechanisms (familywise error=8.4×10-5). Herein NTF3 encodes neurotrophin-3, which controls survival and differentiation of neurons and which is closely related to the nerve growth factor. Conclusions By an integrated approach of miRNA and mRNA sequencing data of OA cartilage, an OA miRNA interactome and related pathways were elucidated. Our functional data demonstrated interacting levels at which miRNA affects expression of genes in the cartilage and exemplified the complexity of functionally validating a network of genes that may be targeted by multiple miRNAs. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB  - Motivation Genomic sequencing studies, including RNA sequencing and bisulfite sequencing studies, are becoming increasingly common and increasingly large. Large genomic sequencing studies open doors for accurate molecular trait heritability estimation and powerful differential analysis. Heritability estimation and differential analysis in sequencing studies requires the development of statistical methods that can properly account for the count nature of the sequencing data and that are computationally efficient for large datasets. Results Here, we develop such a method, PQLseq (Penalized Quasi-Likelihood for sequencing count data), to enable effective and efficient heritability estimation and differential analysis using the generalized linear mixed model framework. With extensive simulations and comparisons to previous methods, we show that PQLseq is the only method currently available that can produce unbiased heritability estimates for sequencing count data. In addition, we show that PQLseq is well suited for differential analysis in large sequencing studies, providing calibrated type I error control and more power compared to the standard linear mixed model methods. Finally, we apply PQLseq to perform gene expression heritability estimation and differential expression analysis in a large RNA sequencing study in the Hutterites. Availability and implementation PQLseq is implemented as an R package with source code freely available at www.xzlab.org/software.html and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PQLseq/index.html.

AB  - Metabolic reprogramming is a general feature of cancer cells. Regrettably, the comprehensive quantification of metabolites in biological specimens does not promptly translate into knowledge on the utilization of metabolic pathways. By estimating fluxes across metabolic pathways, computational models hold the promise to bridge this gap between data and biological functionality. These models currently portray the average behavior of cell populations however, masking the inherent heterogeneity that is part and parcel of tumorigenesis as much as drug resistance. To remove this limitation, we propose single-cell Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA) as a computational framework to translate single-cell transcriptomes into single-cell fluxomes. We show that the integration of single-cell RNA-seq profiles of cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer patients into a multi-scale stoichiometric model of a cancer cell population: significantly 1) reduces the space of feasible single-cell fluxomes; 2) allows to identify clusters of cells with different growth rates within the population; 3) points out the possible metabolic interactions among cells via exchange of metabolites. The scFBA suite of MATLAB functions is available at https://github.com/ BIMIB-DISCo/scFBA, as well as the case study datasets. © 2019 Damiani et al.

AB  - N 6 -Methyladenosine (m 6 A) refers to methylation modification of the adenosine nucleotide acid at the nitrogen-6 position. Many conventional computational methods for identifying N 6 -methyladenosine sites are limited by the small amount of data available. Taking advantage of the thousands of m 6 A sites detected by high-throughput sequencing, it is now possible to discover the characteristics of m 6 A sequences using deep learning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to use word embedding and deep neural networks for m 6 A prediction from mRNA sequences. Using four deep neural networks, we developed a model inferred from a larger sequence shifting window that can predict m 6 A accurately and robustly. Four prediction schemes were built with various RNA sequence representations and optimized convolutional neural networks. The soft voting results from the four deep networks were shown to outperform all of the state-of-the-art methods. We evaluated these predictors mentioned above on a rigorous independent test data set and proved that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors. The training, independent, and cross-species testing data sets are much larger than in previous studies, which could help to avoid the problem of overfitting. Furthermore, an online prediction web server implementing the four proposed predictors has been built and is available at http://server.malab.cn/Gene2vec/. © 2019 Zou et al.

AB  - Background: Resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been linked to local immunosuppression independent of major ICI targets (e.g., PD-1). Clinical experience with response prediction based on PD-L1 expression suggests that other factors influence sensitivity to ICIs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods: Tumor specimens from 120 NSCLC patients from 10 institutions were evaluated for PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, and global proliferative profile by targeted RNA-seq. Results: Cell proliferation, derived from the mean expression of 10 proliferation-associated genes (namely BUB1, CCNB2, CDK1, CDKN3, FOXM1, KIAA0101, MAD2L1, MELK, MKI67, and TOP2A), was identified as a marker of response to ICIs in NSCLC. Poorly, moderately, and highly proliferative tumors were somewhat equally represented in NSCLC, with tumors with the highest PD-L1 expression being more frequently moderately proliferative as compared to lesser levels of PD-L1 expression. Proliferation status had an impact on survival in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. There was a significant survival advantage for moderately proliferative tumors compared to their combined highly/poorly counterparts (p = 0.021). Moderately proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors had a median survival of 14.6 months that was almost twice that of PD-L1 negative highly/poorly proliferative at 7.6 months (p = 0.028). Median survival in moderately proliferative PD-L1 negative tumors at 12.6 months was comparable to that of highly/poorly proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors at 11.5 months, but in both instances less than that of moderately proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors. Similar to survival, proliferation status has impact on disease control (DC) in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. Patients with moderately versus those with poorly or highly proliferative tumors have a superior DC rate when combined with any classification schema used to score PD-L1 as a positive result (i.e., TPS ≥ 50% or ≥ 1%), and best displayed by a DC rate for moderately proliferative tumors of no less than 40% for any classification of PD-L1 as a negative result. While there is an over representation of moderately proliferative tumors as PD-L1 expression increases this does not account for the improved survival or higher disease control rates seen in PD-L1 negative tumors. Conclusions: Cell proliferation is potentially a new biomarker of response to ICIs in NSCLC and is applicable to PD-L1 negative tumors. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The comeasurement of both genomic and transcriptomic signatures in single cells is of fundamental importance to accurately assess how the genetic information correlates with the transcriptomic phenotype. However, existing technologies have low throughput and laborious work flows. METHODS: We developed a new method for concurrent sequencing of the transcriptome and targeted genomic regions (CORTAD-seq) within the same single cell on an automated microfluidic platform. The method was compatible with the downstream library preparation, allowing easy integration into existing next-generation sequencing work flows. We incorporated a single-cell bioinformatics pipeline for transcriptome and mutation analysis. RESULTS: As proof of principle, we applied CORTAD-seq to lung cancer cell lines to dissect the cellular consequences of mutations that result in resistance to targeted therapy. We obtained a mean detection of 6000 expressed genes and an exonic rate of 50%. The targeted DNA-sequencing data achieved a 97.8% detection rate for mutations and allowed for the identification of copy number variations and haplotype construction. We detected expression signatures of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification, and expansion of the T790M mutation among resistant cells. We also identified characteristics for TKI resistance that were independent of EGFR T790M, indicating that other alterations are required for resistance in this context. CONCLUSIONS: CORTAD-seq allows assessment of the interconnection between genetic and transcriptomic changes in single cells. It is operated on an automated, commercially available single-cell isolation platform, making its implementation straightforward. © 2018 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

AB  - Background: Normal tissue samples are often employed as a control for understanding disease mechanisms, however, collecting matched normal tissues from patients is difficult in many instances. In cancer research, for example, the open cancer resources such as TCGA and TARGET do not provide matched tissue samples for every cancer or cancer subtype. The recent GTEx project has profiled samples from healthy individuals, providing an excellent resource for this field, yet the feasibility of using GTEx samples as the reference remains unanswered. Methods: We analyze RNA-Seq data processed from the same computational pipeline and systematically evaluate GTEx as a potential reference resource. We use those cancers that have adjacent normal tissues in TCGA as a benchmark for the evaluation. To correlate tumor samples and normal samples, we explore top varying genes, reduced features from principal component analysis, and encoded features from an autoencoder neural network. We first evaluate whether these methods can identify the correct tissue of origin from GTEx for a given cancer and then seek to answer whether disease expression signatures are consistent between those derived from TCGA and from GTEx. Results: Among 32 TCGA cancers, 18 cancers have less than 10 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. Among three methods, autoencoder performed the best in predicting tissue of origin, with 12 of 14 cancers correctly predicted. The reason for misclassification of two cancers is that none of normal samples from GTEx correlate well with any tumor samples in these cancers. This suggests that GTEx has matched tissues for the majority cancers, but not all. While using autoencoder to select proper normal samples for disease signature creation, we found that disease signatures derived from normal samples selected via an autoencoder from GTEx are consistent with those derived from adjacent samples from TCGA in many cases. Interestingly, choosing top 50 mostly correlated samples regardless of tissue type performed reasonably well or even better in some cancers. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that samples from GTEx can serve as reference normal samples for cancers, especially those do not have available adjacent tissue samples. A deep-learning based approach holds promise to select proper normal samples. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Aims: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been successfully used as a treatment for diabetic foot ulceration (DFU). Its mechanism of action on the molecular level, however, is not fully understood. We assessed the effect of NPWT on gene expression in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and DFU. Methods: We included two cohorts of patients—individuals treated with either NPWT or standard therapy. The assignment to NWPT was non-randomized and based on wound characteristics. Differential gene expression profiling was performed using Illumina gene expression arrays and R Bioconductor pipelines based on the ‘limma’ package. Results: The final cohort encompassed 21 patients treated with NPWT and 8 with standard therapy. The groups were similar in terms of age (69.0 versus 67.5 years) and duration of T2DM (14.5 versus 14.4 years). We identified four genes differentially expressed between the two study arms post-treatment, but not pre-treatment: GFRA2 (GDNF family receptor alpha-2), C1QBP (complement C1q binding protein), RAB35 (member of RAS oncogene family) and SYNJ1 (synaptic inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase 1). Interestingly, all four genes seemed to be functionally involved in wound healing by influencing re-epithelialization and angiogenesis. Subsequently, we utilized co-expression analysis in publicly available RNA-seq data to reveal the molecular functions of GFRA2 and C1QBP, which appeared to be through direct protein–protein interactions. Conclusions: We found initial evidence that the NPWT effect on DFUs may be mediated through differential gene expression. A discovery of the specific molecular mechanisms of NPWT is potentially valuable for its clinical application and development of new therapies. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has been widely accepted as an essential tool in molecular biology. Reduced costs and automated analysis pipelines make the use of NGS data feasible even for small labs, yet the methods for interpreting the data are not sophisticated enough to account for the amount of information. Results: We propose s ·nr, a Visual Analytics tool that provides simple yet powerful visual interfaces for displaying and querying NGS data. It allows researchers to explore their own data in the context of experimental data deposited in public repositories, as well as to extract specific data sets with similar gene expression signatures. We tested s ·nr on 1543 RNA-Seq based mouse differential expression profiles derived from the public ArrayExpress platform. We provide the repository of processed data with this paper. Conclusion: s ·nr, easily deployable utilizing its containerized implementation, empowers researchers to analyze and relate their own RNA-Seq as well as to provide interactive and contextual crosstalk with data from public repositories. This allows users to deduce novel and unbiased hypotheses about the underlying molecular processes. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The design of synthetic cells requires a detailed understanding of the relevance of genes and gene networks underlying complex cellular phenotypes. Transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq) and constraint-based metabolic modeling can be used to probe the core genetic and metabolic networks underlying a biological process. Integrating these highly complementary experimental and in silico approaches has the potential to yield a highly comprehensive understanding of the core networks of a cell. Specifically, it can facilitate the interpretation of Tn-seq data sets and identify gaps in the data that could hinder the engineering of the cellular system, while also providing refined models for the accurate predictions of cellular metabolism. Here, we present Tn-Core, the first easy-to-use computational pipeline specifically designed for integrating Tn-seq data with metabolic modeling, prepared for use by both experimental and computational biologists. Tn-Core is a MATLAB toolbox that contains several custom functions, and it is built upon existing functions within the COBRA Toolbox and the TIGER Toolbox. Tn-Core takes as input a genome-scale metabolic model, Tn-seq data, and optionally RNA-seq data, and returns: (i) a context-specific core metabolic model; (ii) an evaluation of redundancies within core metabolic pathways, and optionally (iii) a refined genome-scale metabolic model. A simple, user-friendly workflow, requiring limited knowledge of metabolic modeling, is provided that allows users to run the analyses and export the data as easy-to-explore files of value to both experimental and computational biologists. We demonstrate the utility of Tn-Core using Sinorhizobium meliloti, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides genome-scale metabolic reconstructions as case studies. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Being critically important to the ecosystem, the stability of coral reefs is directly related to the marine and surrounding terrestrial environments. However, coral reefs are now undergoing massive and accelerating devastation due to bleaching. The fact that the breakdown of symbiosis between coral and the dinoflagellate, zooxanthellae, has been well elucidated as the main cause of bleaching, implying the establishment of symbiosis with zooxanthellae plays a crucial role in maintaining coral survival. However, the relevant molecular and cellular mechanisms have not been well studied yet. In this study, based on the deep RNA-sequencing data derived from Mohamed, A. R. et al., an integrated transcriptome analysis was performed to deeply investigate global transcriptome changes of the coral Acropora digitifera in response to infection by dinoflagellate of the genus Symbiodinium. Results: The results revealed that compared to RefTranscriptome-v1.0 (A. digitifera transcriptome assembly v1.0), numerous novel transcripts and isoforms were identified, the Symbiodinium-infected coral larvae at 4 h generated the highest proportion of specific isoforms. Alternative splicing analysis showed that intron retention predominated in all alternative transcripts among six statuses. Additionally, 8117 lncRNAs were predicted via a stringent stepwise filtering pipeline. A complex lncRNAs-mRNAs network including 815 lncRNAs and 6395 mRNAs were established, in which 21 lncRNAs were differentially expressed at 4 h post infection. Functional clustering analysis for those differentially lncRNAs-coexpressed mRNAs demonstrated that several biological processes and pathways related to protein kinase activity, metabolic pathways, mitochondrion, ribosome, etc. were enriched. Conclusions: Our study not only refined A. digitifera transcriptome via identification of novel transcripts and isoforms, but also predicted a high-confidence dataset of lncRNAs. Functional study based on the construction of lncRNAs-mRNAs co-expression network has disclosed a complex lncRNA-mediated regulation in response to Symbiodinium infection exhibited in A. digitifera. Once validated, these lncRNAs could be good potential targets for treatment and prevention of bleaching in coral. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important component of mammalian genomes, where their numbers are even larger than that of protein-coding genes. For example, human (Homo sapiens) (96,308 vs. 20,376) and mouse (Mus musculus) (87,774 vs. 22,630) have more lncRNA genes than protein-coding genes in the NONCODEv5 database. Recently, mammalian lncRNAs were reported to play critical roles in immune response to influenza A virus infections. Such observation inspired us to identify lncRNAs related to immune response to influenza A virus in duck, which is the most important natural host of influenza A viruses. Results: We explored features of 62,447 lncRNAs from human, mouse, chicken, zebrafish and elegans, and developed a pipeline to identify lncRNAs using the identified features with transcriptomic data. We then collected 151,970 assembled transcripts from RNA-Seq data of 21 individuals from three tissues and annotated 4094 duck lncRNAs. Comparing to duck protein-coding transcripts, we found that 4094 lncRNAs had smaller number of exons (2.4 vs. 10.2) and longer length of transcripts (1903.0 bp vs. 1686.9 bp) on average. Among them, 3586 (87.6%) lncRNAs located in intergenic regions and 619 lncRNAs showed differential expression in ducks infected by H5N1 virus when compared to control individuals. 58 lncRNAs were involved into two co-expressional modules related to anti-influenza A virus immune response. Moreover, we confirmed that eight lncRNAs showed remarkably differential expression both in vivo (duck individuals) and in vitro (duck embryo fibroblast cells, DEF cells) after infected with H5N1 viruses, implying they might play important roles in response to influenza A virus infection. Conclusions: This study presented an example to annotate lncRNA in new species based on model species using transcriptome data. These data and analysis provide information for duck lncRNAs' function in immune response to influenza A virus. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Stemformatics is an established gene expression data portal containing over 420 public gene expression datasets derived from microarray, RNA sequencing and single cell profiling technologies. Developed for the stem cell community, it has a major focus on pluripotency, tissue stem cells, and staged differentiation. Stemformatics includes curated 'collections' of data relevant to cell reprogramming, as well as hematopoiesis and leukaemia. Rather than simply rehosting datasets as they appear in public repositories, Stemformatics uses a stringent set of quality control metrics and its own pipelines to process handpicked datasets from raw files. This means that about 30% of datasets processed by Stemformatics fail the quality controlmetrics and never make it to the portal, ensuring that Stemformatics data are of high quality and have been processed in a consistent manner. Stemformatics provides easy-to-use and intuitive tools for biologists to visually explore the data, including interactive gene expression profiles, principal component analysis plots and hierarchical clusters, among others. The addition of tools that facilitate cross-dataset comparisons provides users with snapshots of gene expression in multiple cell and tissues, assisting the identification of cell-type restricted genes, or potential housekeeping genes.

AB  - Extensive use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for pathogen profiling has the potential to transform our understanding of how genomic plasticity contributes to phenotypic versatility. However, the storage of large amounts of NGS data and visualization tools need to evolve to offer the scientific community fast and convenient access to these data. We introduce BACTOME as a database system that links aligned DNA- and RNA-sequencing reads of clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates with clinically relevant pathogen phenotypes. The database allows data extraction for any single isolate, gene or phenotype as well as data filtering and phenotypic grouping for specific research questions. With the integration of statistical tools we illustrate the usefulness of a relational database structure for the identification of phenotype-genotype correlations as an essential part of the discovery pipeline in genomic research. Furthermore, the database provides a compilation of DNA sequences and gene expression values of a plethora of clinical isolates to give a consensus DNA sequence and consensus gene expression signature. Deviations from the consensus thereby describe the genomic landscape and the transcriptional plasticity of the species P. aeruginosa.

AB  - Background: 3' RNA sequencing provides an alternative to whole transcript analysis. However, we do not know a priori the relative advantage of each method. Thus, a comprehensive comparison between the whole transcript and the 3′ method is needed to determine their relative merits. To this end, we used two commercially available library preparation kits, the KAPA Stranded mRNA-Seq kit (traditional method) and the Lexogen QuantSeq 3' mRNA-Seq kit (3′ method), to prepare libraries from mouse liver RNA. We then sequenced and analyzed the libraries to determine the advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches. Results: We found that the traditional whole transcript method and the 3' RNA-Seq method had similar levels of reproducibility. As expected, the whole transcript method assigned more reads to longer transcripts, while the 3′ method assigned roughly equal numbers of reads to transcripts regardless of their lengths. We found that the 3' RNA-Seq method detected more short transcripts than the whole transcript method. With regard to differential expression analysis, we found that the whole transcript method detected more differentially expressed genes, regardless of the level of sequencing depth. Conclusions: The 3' RNA-Seq method was better able to detect short transcripts, while the whole transcript RNA-Seq was able to detect more differentially expressed genes. Thus, both approaches have relative advantages and should be selected based on the goals of the experiment. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Since its establishment in 2009, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been a major driver behind progress in biomedical research. In developmental biology and stem cell studies, the ability to profile single cells confers particular benefits. Although most studies still focus on individual tissues or organs, the recent development of ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq has demonstrated potential power in characterizing more complex systems or even the entire body. However, although multiple ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems have attracted attention, no systematic comparison of these systems has been performed. Here, with the same cell line and bioinformatics pipeline, we developed directly comparable datasets for each of three widely used droplet-based ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems, inDrop, Drop-seq, and 10X Genomics Chromium. Although each system is capable of profiling single-cell transcriptomes, their detailed comparison revealed the distinguishing features and suitable applications for each system. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Orre et al. use mass spectrometry to map the subcellular localization of more than 12,000 proteins across several cell lines and present a method for proteome-wide relocalization analysis. This study provides information about the spatial organization of the proteome and an accessible resource for protein localization, subcellbarcode.org. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
Subcellular localization is a main determinant of protein function; however, a global view of cellular proteome organization remains relatively unexplored. We have developed a robust mass spectrometry-based analysis pipeline to generate a proteome-wide view of subcellular localization for proteins mapping to 12,418 individual genes across five cell lines. Based on more than 83,000 unique classifications and correlation profiling, we investigate the effect of alternative splicing and protein domains on localization, complex member co-localization, cell-type-specific localization, as well as protein relocalization after growth factor inhibition. Our analysis provides information about the cellular architecture and complexity of the spatial organization of the proteome; we show that the majority of proteins have a single main subcellular location, that alternative splicing rarely affects subcellular location, and that cell types are best distinguished by expression of proteins exposed to the surrounding environment.

AB  - Fusion detection in cancer is of utmost clinical importance. Dupain et al. validated a reliable tool, ChimComp, to predict their presence and oncogenicity from sequencing data, and they identified new potentially targetable fusions in a cohort of pediatric cancer patients at relapse. This will hopefully contribute to personalized medicine in cancer. © 2018 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy
We hypothetized that pediatric cancers would more likely harbor fusion transcripts. To dissect the complexity of the fusions landscape in recurrent solid pediatric cancers, we conducted a study on 48 patients with different relapsing or resistant malignancies. By analyzing RNA sequencing data with a new in-house pipeline for fusions detection named ChimComp, followed by verification by real-time PCR, we identified and classified the most confident fusion transcripts (FTs) according to their potential biological function and druggability. The majority of FTs were predicted to affect key cancer pathways and described to be involved in oncogenesis. Contrary to previous descriptions, we found no significant correlation between the number of fusions and mutations, emphasizing the particularity to study pre-treated pediatric patients. A considerable proportion of FTs containing tumor suppressor genes was detected, reflecting their importance in pediatric cancers. FTs containing non-receptor tyrosine kinases occurred at low incidence and predominantly in brain tumors. Remarkably, more than 30% of patients presented a potentially druggable high-confidence fusion. In conclusion, we detected new oncogenic FTs in relapsing pediatric cancer patients by establishing a robust pipeline that can be applied to other malignancies, to detect and prioritize experimental validation studies leading to the development of new therapeutic options. © 2018 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy

AB  - Microfluidic devices provide a low-input and efficient platform for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Existing microfluidic devices have a complicated multi-chambered structure for handling the multi-step process involved in RNA-seq and dilution between steps is used to negate the inhibitory effects among reagents. This makes the device difficult to fabricate and operate. Here we present microfluidic diffusion-based RNA-seq (MID-RNA-seq) for conducting scRNA-seq with a diffusion-based reagent swapping scheme. This device incorporates cell trapping, lysis, reverse transcription and PCR amplification all in one simple microfluidic device. MID-RNA-seq provides high data quality that is comparable to existing scRNA-seq methods while implementing a simple device design that permits multiplexing. The robustness and scalability of the MID-RNA-seq device will be important for transcriptomic studies of scarce cell samples. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - We proposed a data cleaning pipeline for single cell (SC) RNA-seq data, where we first screen genes (gene-wise screening) followed by screening cell libraries (library-wise screening). Gene-wise screening is based on the expectation that for a gene with a low technical noise, a gene's count in a library will tend to increase with the increase of library size, which was tested using negative binomial regression of gene count (as dependent variable) against library size (as independent variable). Library-wise screening is based on the expectation that across-library correlations for housekeeping (HK) genes is expected to be higher than the correlations for non-housekeeping (NHK) genes in those libraries with low technical noise. We removed those libraries, whose mean pairwise correlation for HK genes is NOT significantly higher than that for NHK genes. We successfully applied the pipeline to two large SC RNA-seq datasets. The pipeline was also developed into an R package. © 2019

AB  - Background: Tobacco is smoked in different form including cigarettes and water pipes. One popular form of water pipe smoking especially in Middle Eastern countries is shisha smoking. Shisha has been associated with various diseases including oral cancer. However, genomic alterations and gene expression changes associated with chronic shisha exposure have not been previously investigated. Objectives: Whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling of immortalized human oral keratinocytes (OKF6/TERT1) cells chronically treated with 0.5% shisha extract for a period of 8 months was undertaken to characterize molecular alterations associated with shisha exposure. Methods: Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and preprocessed as per manufacturer's instruction and subjected to whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. Exome was analyzed using GATK pipeline whereas RNA-Seq data was analyzed using HiSat2 and HTSeq along with DESeq to elucidate differentially expressed genes. Results: Whole-exome sequence analysis led to identification of 521 somatic missense variants corresponding to 389 genes RNA-Seq data revealed 247 differentially expressed genes (≥2-fold, P-value<0.01) in shisha treated cells compared to parental cells. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that interferon-signaling pathway was significantly affected. We predict activation of MAPK1 pathway which is known to play a key role in oral cancer. We also observed allele specific expression of mutant LIMA1 based on RNA-Seq dataset. Conclusion: Our findings provide insights into genomic alterations and gene expression pattern associated with oral keratinocytes chronically exposed to shisha. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - RNA sequencing allows one to study allelic imbalance of gene expression, which may be due to genetic factors or genomic imprinting (i.e., higher expression of maternal or paternal allele). It is desirable to model both genetic and parent-of-origin effects simultaneously to avoid confounding and to improve the power to detect either effect. In studies of genetically tractable model organisms, separation of genetic and parent-of-origin effects can be achieved by studying reciprocal cross of two inbred strains. In contrast, this task is much more challenging in outbred populations such as humans. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework to combine experimental strategies and novel statistical methods. Specifically, we propose to study genetic and imprinting effects in family trios with RNA-seq data from the children and genotype data from both parents and children, and quantify genetic effects by cis-eQTLs. Towards this end, we have extended our method that studies the eQTLs of RNA-seq data (Sun, Biometrics 2012, 68(1): 1–11) to model both cis-eQTL and parent-of-origin effects, and evaluated its performance using extensive simulations. Since sample size may be limited in family trios, we have developed a data analysis pipeline that borrows information from external data of unrelated individuals for cis-eQTL mapping. We have also collected RNA-seq data from the children of 30 family trios, applied our method to analyze this dataset, and identified some previously reported imprinted genes as well as some new candidates of imprinted genes. © 2019 International Biometric Society

AB  - In eukaryotes, alternative splicing (AS) greatly expands the diversity of transcripts. However, it is challenging to accurately determine full-length splicing isoforms. Recently, more studies have taken advantage of Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) long-read sequencing to identify full-length transcripts. Nevertheless, the high error rate of PacBio reads seriously offsets the advantages of long reads, especially for accurately identifying splicing junctions. To best capitalize on the features of long reads, we used Illumina RNA-seq reads to improve PacBio circular consensus sequence (CCS) quality and to validate splicing patterns in the rice transcriptome. We evaluated the impact of CCS accuracy on the number and the validation rate of splicing isoforms, and integrated a comprehensive pipeline of splicing transcripts analysis by Iso-Seq and RNA-seq (STAIR) to identify the full-length multi-exon isoforms in rice seedling transcriptome (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica). STAIR discovered 11 733 full-length multi-exon isoforms, 6599 more than the SMRT Portal RS_IsoSeq pipeline did. Of these splicing isoforms identified, 4453 (37.9%) were missed in assembled transcripts from RNA-seq reads, and 5204 (44.4%), including 268 multi-exon long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), were not reported in the MSU_osa1r7 annotation. Some randomly selected unreported splicing junctions were verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. In addition, we investigated alternative polyadenylation (APA) events in transcripts and identified 829 major polyadenylation [poly(A)] site clusters (PACs). The analysis of splicing isoforms and APA events will facilitate the annotation of the rice genome and studies on the expression and polyadenylation of AS genes in different developmental stages or growth conditions of rice. © 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important worldwide crops. The genome has been available for over 10 years and has undergone several rounds of annotation. We created a comprehensive database of transcripts from 29 public RNA sequencing data sets, officially predicted genes from Ensembl plants, and common contaminants in which to search for protein-level evidence. We re-analyzed nine publicly accessible rice proteomics data sets. In total, we identified 420K peptide spectrum matches from 47K peptides and 8,187 protein groups. 4168 peptides were initially classed as putative novel peptides (not matching official genes). Following a strict filtration scheme to rule out other possible explanations, we discovered 1,584 high confidence novel peptides. The novel peptides were clustered into 692 genomic loci where our results suggest annotation improvements. 80% of the novel peptides had an ortholog match in the curated protein sequence set from at least one other plant species. For the peptides clustering in intergenic regions (and thus potentially new genes), 101 loci were identified, for which 43 had a high-confidence hit for a protein domain. Our results can be displayed as tracks on the Ensembl genome or other browsers supporting Track Hubs, to support re-annotation of the rice genome. © 2019 Varland et al.

AB  - The pig is a well-studied model animal of biomedical and agricultural importance. Genes of this species, Sus scrofa, are known from experiments and predictions, and collected at the NCBI reference sequence database section. Gene reconstruction from transcribed gene evidence of RNA-seq now can accurately and completely reproduce the biological gene sets of animals and plants. Such a gene set for the pig is reported here, including human orthologs missing from current NCBI and Ensembl reference pig gene sets, additional alternate transcripts, and other improvements. Methodology for accurate and complete gene set reconstruction from RNA is used: the automated SRA2Genes pipeline of EvidentialGene project. © 2019 Gilbert.

AB  - Preparation of high-quality sequencing libraries is a costly and time-consuming component of metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). While the overall cost of sequencing has dropped significantly over recent years, the reagents needed to prepare sequencing samples are likely to become the dominant expense in the process. Furthermore, libraries prepared by hand are subject to human variability and needless waste due to limitations of manual pipetting volumes. Reduction of reaction volumes, combined with sub-microliter automated dispensing of reagents without consumable pipette tips, has the potential to provide significant advantages. Here, we describe the integration of several instruments, including the Labcyte Echo 525 acoustic liquid handler and the iSeq and NovaSeq Illumina sequencing platforms, to miniaturize and automate mNGS library preparation, significantly reducing the cost and the time required to prepare samples. Through the use of External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) spike-in RNAs, we demonstrated the fidelity of the miniaturized preparation to be equivalent to full volume reactions. Furthermore, detection of viral and microbial species from cell culture and patient samples was also maintained in the miniaturized libraries. For 384-well mNGS library preparations, we achieved cost savings of over 80% in materials and reagents alone, and reduced preparation time by 90% compared to manual approaches, without compromising quality or representation within the library. © 2019 Mayday et al.

AB  - RNAcentral is a comprehensive database of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences, collating information on ncRNA sequences of all types from a broad range of organisms. We have recently added a new genome mapping pipeline that identifies genomic locations for ncRNA sequences in 296 species. We have also added several new types of functional annotations, such as tRNA secondary structures, Gene Ontology annotations, and miRNA-Target interactions. A new quality control mechanism based on Rfam family assignments identifies potential contamination, incomplete sequences, and more. The RNAcentral database has become a vital component of many workflows in the RNA community, serving as both the primary source of sequence data for academic and commercial groups, as well as a source of stable accessions for the annotation of genomic and functional features. These examples are facilitated by an improved RNAcentral web interface, which features an updated genome browser, a new sequence feature viewer, and improved text search functionality.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are the main components of the plant innate immune system. Defensins represent the most important AMP family involved in defense and non-defense functions. In this work, global RNA sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly were performed to explore the diversity of defensin-like (DEFL) genes in the wheat Triticum kiharae and to study their role in induced resistance (IR) mediated by the elicitor metabolites of a non-pathogenic strain FS-94 of Fusarium sambucinum. Using a combination of two pipelines for DEFL mining in transcriptome data sets, as many as 143 DEFL genes were identified in T. kiharae, the vast majority of them represent novel genes. According to the number of cysteine residues and the cysteine motif, wheat DEFLs were classified into ten groups. Classical defensins with a characteristic 8-Cys motif assigned to group 1 DEFLs represent the most abundant group comprising 52 family members. DEFLs with a characteristic 4-Cys motif CX{3,5}CX{8,17}CX{4,6}C named group 4 DEFLs previously found only in legumes were discovered in wheat. Within DEFL groups, subgroups of similar sequences originated by duplication events were isolated. Variation among DEFLs within subgroups is due to amino acid substitutions and insertions/deletions of amino acid sequences. To identify IR-related DEFL genes, transcriptional changes in DEFL gene expression during elicitor-mediated IR were monitored. Transcriptional diversity of DEFL genes in wheat seedlings in response to the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, FS-94 elicitors, and the combination of both (elicitors + fungus) was demonstrated, with specific sets of up- and down-regulated DEFL genes. DEFL expression profiling allowed us to gain insight into the mode of action of the elicitors from F. sambucinum. We discovered that the elicitors up-regulated a set of 24 DEFL genes. After challenge inoculation with F. oxysporum, another set of 22 DEFLs showed enhanced expression in IR-displaying seedlings. These DEFLs, in concert with other defense molecules, are suggested to determine enhanced resistance of elicitor-pretreated wheat seedlings. In addition to providing a better understanding of the mode of action of the elicitors from FS-94 in controlling diseases, up-regulated IR-specific DEFL genes represent novel candidates for genetic transformation of plants and development of pathogen-resistant crops.

AB  - Bacterial small (sRNAs) are involved in the control of several cellular processes. Hundreds of putative sRNAs have been identified in many bacterial species through RNA sequencing. The existence of putative sRNAs is usually validated by Northern blot analysis. However, the large amount of novel putative sRNAs reported in the literature makes it impractical to validate each of them in the wet lab. In this work, we applied five machine learning approaches to construct twenty models to discriminate bona fide sRNAs from random genomic sequences in five bacterial species. Sequences were represented using seven features including free energy of their predicted secondary structure, their distances to the closest predicted promoter site and Rho-independent terminator, and their distance to the closest open reading frames (ORFs). To automatically calculate these features, we developed an sRNA Characterization Pipeline (sRNACharP). All seven features used in the classification task contributed positively to the performance of the predictive models. The best performing model obtained a median precision of 100% at 10% recall and of 64% at 40% recall across all five bacterial species, and it outperformed previous published approaches on two benchmark datasets in terms of precision and recall. Our results indicate that even though there is limited sRNA sequence conservation across different bacterial species, there are intrinsic features in the genomic context of sRNAs that are conserved across taxa. We show that these features are utilized by machine learning approaches to learn a species-independent model to prioritize bona fide bacterial sRNAs. © 2019 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Researches on immunotherapy of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, WHO grade IV) have increased exponentially in recent years. As a targeted therapy, a series of biomarkers have been identified in local tumor tissue, while circulating marker which could be detected in the body fluids is still lacking. ADAMTSL4, a secreted glycoprotein, was earlier found to play a critical role in a prognostic signature for primary GBM (pGBM). We aimed to investigate the role of ADAMTSL4 at transcriptome level and its relationship with clinical practice in pGBM. Methods: A cohort of 88 pGBM patients with RNA-seq data from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) was analyzed, and 168 pGBM patients from TCGA were included as validation. Several bioinformatic methods and predictive tools were applied to investigate the ADAMTSL4-associated immune microenvironment status. Results: We found that ADAMTSL4 was enriched in GBM (WHO grade IV), especially for those with IDH1/2 wild-type and MGMT unmethylated groups. According to the TCGA classification scheme, ADAMTSL4 can act as a potential marker for subtypes with poorer prognosis. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that ADAMTSL4 was significantly correlated to the immune-related processes in GBM (WHO grade IV), especially representing the infiltration of immune cells and complicated tumor microenvironment. Clinically, high expression of ADAMTSL4 was an independent indicator for poor prognosis. Conclusion: The expression of ADAMTSL4 is closely related to the clinicopathologic characteristics of pGBM. Meanwhile, it may play a critical role in immune-related processes. As a secreted glycoprotein, ADAMTSL4 is a promising circulating biomarker for pGBM, deserving further investigations.

AB  - Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) have been associated with genic regions in plant genomes and may play important roles in the regulation of nearby genes via recruitment of small RNAs (sRNA) to the MITEs loci. We identified eight families of MITEs in the sugarcane genome assembly with MITE-Hunter pipeline. These sequences were found to be upstream, downstream or inserted into 67 genic regions in the genome. The position of the most abundant MITE (Stowaway-like) in genic regions, which we call AddIn-MITE, was confirmed in a WD40 gene. The analysis of four monocot species showed conservation of the AddIn-MITE sequence, with a large number of copies in their genomes. We also investigated the conservation of the AddIn-MITE’ position in the WD40 genes from sorghum, maize and, in sugarcane cultivars and wild Saccharum species. In all analyzed plants, AddIn-MITE has located in WD40 intronic region. Furthermore, the role of AddIn-MITE-related sRNA in WD40 genic region was investigated. We found sRNAs preferentially mapped to the AddIn-MITE than to other regions in the WD40 gene in sugarcane. In addition, the analysis of the small RNA distribution patterns in the WD40 gene and the structure of AddIn-MITE, suggests that the MITE region is a proto-miRNA locus in sugarcane. Together, these data provide insights into the AddIn-MITE role in Andropogoneae grasses. Copyright 2019 Grativol et al.

AB  - Heavy-ion beams have been widely utilized as a novel and effective mutagen for mutation breeding in diverse plant species, but the induced mutation spectrum is not fully understood at the genome scale. We describe the development of a multiplexed and cost-efficient whole-exome sequencing procedure in rice, and its application to characterize an unselected population of heavy-ion beam-induced mutations. The bioinformatics pipeline identified single-nucleotide mutations as well as small and large (&gt;63 kb) insertions and deletions, and showed good agreement with the results obtained with conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analyses. We applied the procedure to analyze the mutation spectrum induced by heavy-ion beams at the population level. In total, 165 individual M 2 lines derived from six irradiation conditions as well as eight pools from non-irradiated ‘Nipponbare’ controls were sequenced using the newly established target exome sequencing procedure. The characteristics and distribution of carbon-ion beam-induced mutations were analyzed in the absence of bias introduced by visual mutant selections. The average (±SE) number of mutations within the target exon regions was 9.06 ± 0.37 induced by 150 Gy irradiation of dry seeds. The mutation frequency changed in parallel to the irradiation dose when dry seeds were irradiated. The total number of mutations detected by sequencing unselected M 2 lines was correlated with the conventional mutation frequency determined by the occurrence of morphological mutants. Therefore, mutation frequency may be a good indicator for sequencing-based determination of the optimal irradiation condition for induction of mutations. © 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for Experimental Biology.

AB  - In metabolic diagnostics, there is an emerging need for a comprehensive test to acquire a complete view of metabolite status. Here, we describe a non-quantitative direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry (DI-HRMS) based metabolomics method and evaluate the method for both dried blood spots (DBS) and plasma. 110 DBS of 42 patients harboring 23 different inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and 86 plasma samples of 38 patients harboring 21 different IEM were analyzed using DI-HRMS. A peak calling pipeline developed in R programming language provided Z-scores for ~1875 mass peaks corresponding to ~3835 metabolite annotations (including isomers) per sample. Based on metabolite Z-scores, patients were assigned a ‘most probable diagnosis’ by an investigator blinded for the known diagnoses of the patients. Based on DBS sample analysis, 37/42 of the patients, corresponding to 22/23 IEM, could be correctly assigned a ‘most probable diagnosis’. Plasma sample analysis, resulted in a correct ‘most probable diagnosis’ in 32/38 of the patients, corresponding to 19/21 IEM. The added clinical value of the method was illustrated by a case wherein DI-HRMS metabolomics aided interpretation of a variant of unknown significance (VUS) identified by whole-exome sequencing. In summary, non-quantitative DI-HRMS metabolomics in DBS and plasma is a very consistent, high-throughput and nonselective method for investigating the metabolome in genetic disease. © 2019, MDPI AG.

AB  - Background: Interactions among transcription factors (TFs) and histone modifications (HMs) play an important role in the precise regulation of gene expression. The context specificity of those interactions and further its dynamics in normal and disease remains largely unknown. Recent development in genomics technology enables transcription profiling by RNA-seq and protein's binding profiling by ChIP-seq. Integrative analysis of the two types of data allows us to investigate TFs and HMs interactions both from the genome co-localization and downstream target gene expression. Results: We propose a integrative pipeline to explore the co-localization of 55 TFs and 11 HMs and its dynamics in human GM12878 and K562 by matched ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from ENCODE. We classify TFs and HMs into three types based on their binding enrichment around transcription start site (TSS). Then a set of statistical indexes are proposed to characterize the TF-TF and TF-HM co-localizations. We found that Rad21, SMC3, and CTCF co-localized across five cell lines. High resolution Hi-C data in GM12878 shows that they associate most of the Hi-C peak loci with a specific CTCF-motif "anchor" and supports that CTCF, SMC3, and RAD2 co-localization serves important role in 3D chromatin structure. Meanwhile, 17 TF-TF pairs are highly dynamic between GM12878 and K562. We then build SVM models to correlate high and low expression level of target genes with TF binding and HM strength. We found that H3k9ac, H3k27ac, and three TFs (ELF1, TAF1, and POL2) are predictive with the accuracy about 85~92%. Conclusion: We propose a pipeline to analyze the co-localization of TF and HM and their dynamics across cell lines from ChIP-seq, and investigate their regulatory potency by RNA-seq. The integrative analysis of two level data reveals new insight for the cooperation of TFs and HMs and is helpful in understanding cell line specificity of TF/HM interactions. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Gastric cancer (GC) ranks the second in mortality rate among all cancers. Metastases account for most of the deaths in GC patients. Yet our understanding of GC and its metastasis mechanism is still very limited. Methods: We performed 20 whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 5 typical metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) patients with lymph node metastasis. We compared both the primary tumors to their metastatic lymph nodes, and a specific analysis pipeline was used to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels) and copy number variants (CNVs). Results: (1) We confirmed 30 candidate mutations in both primary and lymph nodes tissues, and other 7 only in primary tumors. (2) Copy number gains were observed in a large section of 17q12-21, as well as copy number losses in regions containing CDKN2A and CDKN2B in both primary and lymph nodes tissues. Conclusions: Our results provide preliminary insights in the molecular mechanisms of GC initiation, development, and metastatic progression. These results need to be validated through large-scale studies. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Peripheral nerve injury is a worldwide clinical issue that impacts patients' quality of life and causes huge society and economic burden. Injured peripheral nerves are able to regenerate by themselves. However, for severe peripheral nerve injury, the regenerative abilities are very limited and the regenerative effects are very poor. A better understanding of the mechanisms following peripheral nerve injury will benefit its clinical treatment. In this study, we systematically explored the dynamic changes of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the injured sciatic nerve segments after nerve crush, identified significantly involved Gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Enrichment of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and innovatively analyzed the correlation of differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs. After the clustering of co-expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs, we performed functional analysis, selected GO term "negative regulation of cell proliferation", and constructed a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network of LIF and HMOX1 gene in this GO term. This study is the first to provide a systematic dissection of mRNA-microRNA (miRNA)-lncRNA ceRNA network following peripheral nerve injury and thus lays a foundation for further investigations of the regulating mechanisms of non-coding RNAs in peripheral nerve repair and regeneration. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Backgroud: Populus nigra is a major tree species of ecological and economic importance for which several initiatives have been set up to create genomic resources. In order to access the large number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) typically needed to carry out a genome scan, the present study aimed at evaluating RNA sequencing as a tool to discover and type SNPs in genes within natural populations of P. nigra. Results: We have devised a bioinformatics pipeline to call and type SNPs from RNAseq reads and applied it to P. nigra transcriptomic data. The accuracy of the resulting RNAseq-based SNP calling and typing has been evaluated by (i) comparing their position and alleles to those previously reported in candidate genes, (ii) assessing their genotyping accuracy with respect to a previously available SNP chip and (iii) evaluating their inter-annual repeatability. We found that a combination of several callers yields a good compromise between the number of variants type and the accuracy of genotyping. We further used the resulting genotypic data to carry out basic genetic analyses whose results confirm the quality of the RNAseq-based SNP dataset. Conclusions: We demonstrated the potential and accuracy of RNAseq as an efficient way to genotype SNPs in P. nigra. These results open prospects towards the use of this technology for quantitative and population genomics studies. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Targeted resequencing has become the most used and cost-effective approach for identifying causative mutations of Mendelian diseases both for diagnostics and research purposes. Due to very rapid technological progress, NGS laboratories are expanding their capabilities to address the increasing number of analyses. Several open source tools are available to build a generic variant calling pipeline, but a tool able to simultaneously execute multiple analyses, organize, and categorize the samples is still missing. Results: Here we describe VarGenius, a Linux based command line software able to execute customizable pipelines for the analysis of multiple targeted resequencing data using parallel computing. VarGenius provides a database to store the output of the analysis (calling quality statistics, variant annotations, internal allelic variant frequencies) and sample information (personal data, genotypes, phenotypes). VarGenius can also perform the "joint analysis" of hundreds of samples with a single command, drastically reducing the time for the configuration and execution of the analysis. VarGenius executes the standard pipeline of the Genome Analysis Tool-Kit (GATK) best practices (GBP) for germinal variant calling, annotates the variants using Annovar, and generates a user-friendly output displaying the results through a web page. VarGenius has been tested on a parallel computing cluster with 52 machines with 120GB of RAM each. Under this configuration, a 50 M whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis for a family was executed in about 7h (trio or quartet); a joint analysis of 30 WES in about 24 h and the parallel analysis of 34 single samples from a 1 M panel in about 2 h. Conclusions: We developed VarGenius, a "master" tool that faces the increasing demand of heterogeneous NGS analyses and allows maximum flexibility for downstream analyses. It paves the way to a different kind of analysis, centered on cohorts rather than on singleton. Patient and variant information are stored into the database and any output file can be accessed programmatically. VarGenius can be used for routine analyses by biomedical researchers with basic Linux skills providing additional flexibility for computational biologists to develop their own algorithms for the comparison and analysis of data.

AB  - Background: Subterranean rodents have evolved many features to adapt to their hypoxic environment. The brain is an organ that is particularly vulnerable to damage caused by exposure to hypoxic conditions. To investigate the mechanisms of adaption to a hypoxic underground environment, we carried out a cross-species brain transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing and identified genes that are differentially expressed between the subterranean vole Lasiopodomys mandarinus and the closely related above-ground species Lasiopodomys brandtii under chronic hypoxia [10.0% oxygen (O 2 )] and normoxia (20.9% O 2 ). Results: A total of 355 million clean reads were obtained, including 69,611 unigenes in L. mandarinus and 69,360 in L. brandtii. A total of 235 and 92 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing the hypoxic and control groups of L. mandarinus and L. brandtii, respectively. A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that upregulated DEGs in both species had similar functions in response to hypoxia, whereas downregulated DEGs in L. mandarinus were enriched GO terms related to enzymes involved in aerobic reactions. In the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, upregulated DEGs in L. mandarinus were associated with angiogenesis and the increased O 2 transport capacity of red blood cells, whereas downregulated DEGs were associated with immune responses. On the other hand, upregulated DEGs in L. brandtii were associated with cell survival, vascular endothelial cell proliferation, and neuroprotection, while downregulated genes were related to the synaptic transmission by neurons. Conclusions: L. mandarinus actively adapts its physiological functions to hypoxic conditions, for instance by increasing O 2 transport capacity and modulating O 2 consumption. In contrast, L. brandtii reacts passively to hypoxia by decreasing overall activity in order to reduce O 2 consumption. These results provide insight into hypoxia adaptation mechanisms in subterranean rodents that may be applicable to humans living at high altitudes or operating in other O 2 -poor environments. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Abstract Background The usual analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads is based on an existing reference genome and annotated gene models. However, when a reference for the sequenced species is not available, alternatives include using a reference genome from a related species or reconstructing transcript sequences with de novo assembly. In addition, researchers are faced with many options for RNA-seq data processing and limited information on how their decisions will impact the final outcome. Using both a diploid and polyploid species with a distant reference genome, we have tested the influence of different tools at various steps of a typical RNA-seq analysis workflow on the recovery of useful processed data available for downstream analysis. Findings At the preprocessing step, we found error correction has a strong influence on de novo assembly but not on mapping results. After trimming, a greater percentage of reads could be used in downstream analysis by selecting gentle quality trimming performed with Skewer instead of strict quality trimming with Trimmomatic. This availability of reads correlated with size, quality, and completeness of de novo assemblies and with number of mapped reads. When selecting a reference genome from a related species to map reads, outcome was significantly improved when using mapping software tolerant of greater sequence divergence, such as Stampy or GSNAP. Conclusions The selection of bioinformatic software tools for RNA-seq data analysis can maximize quality parameters on de novo assemblies and availability of reads in downstream analysis. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that can be classified into multiple subtypes based on the tumor transcriptome. Most of the subtyping schemes used in clinics today are derived from analyses of microarray data from thousands of different tumors together with clinical data for the patients from which the tumors were isolated. However, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is gradually replacing microarrays as the preferred transcriptomics platform, and although transcript abundances measured by the two different technologies are largely compatible, subtyping methods developed for probe-based microarray data are incompatible with RNA-Seq as input data. Here, we present an RNA-Seq data processing pipeline, which relies on the mapping of sequencing reads to the probe set target sequences instead of the human reference genome, thereby enabling probe-based subtyping of breast cancer tumor tissue using sequencing-based transcriptomics. By analyzing 66 breast cancer tumors for which gene expression was measured using both microarrays and RNA-Seq, we show that RNA-Seq data can be directly compared to microarray data using our pipeline. Additionally, we demonstrate that the established subtyping method CITBCMST (Guedj et al.,), which relies on a 375 probe set-signature to classify samples into the six subtypes basL, lumA, lumB, lumC, mApo, and normL, can be applied without further modifications. This pipeline enables a seamless transition to sequencing-based transcriptomics for future clinical purposes. © 2018 The Authors. Published by FEBS Press and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Barcode swapping results in the mislabelling of sequencing reads between multiplexed samples on patterned flow-cell Illumina sequencing machines. This may compromise the validity of numerous genomic assays; however, the severity and consequences of barcode swapping remain poorly understood. We have used two statistical approaches to robustly quantify the fraction of swapped reads in two plate-based single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. We found that approximately 2.5% of reads were mislabelled between samples on the HiSeq 4000, which is lower than previous reports. We observed no correlation between the swapped fraction of reads and the concentration of free barcode across plates. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that barcode swapping may generate complex but artefactual cell libraries in droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing studies. To eliminate these artefacts, we have developed an algorithm to exclude individual molecules that have swapped between samples in 10x Genomics experiments, allowing the continued use of cutting-edge sequencing machines for these assays. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Abstract In bioinformatics, as well as other computationally intensive research fields, there is a need for workflows that can reliably produce consistent output, from known sources, independent of the software environment or configuration settings of the machine on which they are executed. Indeed, this is essential for controlled comparison between different observations and for the wider dissemination of workflows. However, providing this type of reproducibility and traceability is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which generally comes in various versions. Moreover, in many fields (bioinformatics being a prime example), these versions are subject to continual change due to rapidly evolving technologies, further complicating problems related to reproducibility. Here, we propose a principled approach for building analysis pipelines and managing their dependencies with GNU Guix. As a case study to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present a set of highly reproducible pipelines called PiGx for the analysis of RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, bisulfite-treated DNA sequencing, and single-cell resolution RNA sequencing. All pipelines process raw experimental data and generate reports containing publication-ready plots and figures, with interactive report elements and standard observables. Users may install these highly reproducible packages and apply them to their own datasets without any special computational expertise beyond the use of the command line. We hope such a toolkit will provide immediate benefit to laboratory workers wishing to process their own datasets or bioinformaticians seeking to automate all, or parts of, their analyses. In the long term, we hope our approach to reproducibility will serve as a blueprint for reproducible workflows in other areas. Our pipelines, along with their corresponding documentation and sample reports, are available at http://bioinformatics.mdc-Berlin.de/pigx. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides a new avenue to discover and characterize cell types; however, the experiment-specific technical biases and analytic variability inherent to current pipelines may undermine its replicability. Meta-analysis is further hampered by the use of ad hoc naming conventions. Here we demonstrate our replication framework, MetaNeighbor, that quantifies the degree to which cell types replicate across datasets, and enables rapid identification of clusters with high similarity. We first measure the replicability of neuronal identity, comparing results across eight technically and biologically diverse datasets to define best practices for more complex assessments. We then apply this to novel interneuron subtypes, finding that 24/45 subtypes have evidence of replication, which enables the identification of robust candidate marker genes. Across tasks we find that large sets of variably expressed genes can identify replicable cell types with high accuracy, suggesting a general route forward for large-scale evaluation of scRNA-seq data. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) studies profile thousands of cells in heterogeneous environments. Current methods for characterizing cells perform unsupervised analysis followed by assignment using a small set of known marker genes. Such approaches are limited to a few, well characterized cell types. We developed an automated pipeline to download, process, and annotate publicly available scRNA-seq datasets to enable large scale supervised characterization. We extend supervised neural networks to obtain efficient and accurate representations for scRNA-seq data. We apply our pipeline to analyze data from over 500 different studies with over 300 unique cell types and show that supervised methods outperform unsupervised methods for cell type identification. A case study highlights the usefulness of these methods for comparing cell type distributions in healthy and diseased mice. Finally, we present scQuery, a web server which uses our neural networks and fast matching methods to determine cell types, key genes, and more. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - To evaluate the potential of an integrated clinical test to detect diverse classes of somatic and germline mutations relevant to pediatric oncology, we performed three-platform whole-genome (WGS), whole exome (WES) and transcriptome (RNA-Seq) sequencing of tumors and normal tissue from 78 pediatric cancer patients in a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory. Our analysis pipeline achieves high accuracy by cross-validating variants between sequencing types, thereby removing the need for confirmatory testing, and facilitates comprehensive reporting in a clinically-relevant timeframe. Three-platform sequencing has a positive predictive value of 97–99, 99, and 91% for somatic SNVs, indels and structural variations, respectively, based on independent experimental verification of 15,225 variants. We report 240 pathogenic variants across all cases, including 84 of 86 known from previous diagnostic testing (98% sensitivity). Combined WES and RNA-Seq, the current standard for precision oncology, achieved only 78% sensitivity. These results emphasize the critical need for incorporating WGS in pediatric oncology testing. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - We introduce the CDRP (Concatenated Diagnostic-Relapse Prognostic) architecture for multi-task deep learning that incorporates a clinical algorithm, e.g., a risk stratification schema to improve prognostic profiling. We present the first application to survival prediction in High-Risk (HR) Neuroblastoma from transcriptomics data, a task that studies from the MAQC consortium have shown to remain the hardest among multiple diagnostic and prognostic endpoints predictable from the same dataset. To obtain a more accurate risk stratification needed for appropriate treatment strategies, CDRP combines a first component (CDRP-A) synthesizing a diagnostic task and a second component (CDRP-N) dedicated to one or more prognostic tasks. The approach leverages the advent of semi-supervised deep learning structures that can flexibly integrate multimodal data or internally create multiple processing paths. CDRP-A is an autoencoder trained on gene expression on the HR/non-HR risk stratification by the Children’s Oncology Group, obtaining a 64-node representation in the bottleneck layer. CDRP-N is a multi-task classifier for two prognostic endpoints, i.e., Event-Free Survival (EFS) and Overall Survival (OS). CDRP-A provides the HR embedding input to the CDRP-N shared layer, from which two branches depart to model EFS and OS, respectively. To control for selection bias, CDRP is trained and evaluated using a Data Analysis Protocol (DAP) developed within the MAQC initiative. CDRP was applied on Illumina RNA-Seq of 498 Neuroblastoma patients (HR: 176) from the SEQC study (12,464 Entrez genes) and on Affymetrix Human Exon Array expression profiles (17,450 genes) of 247 primary diagnostic Neuroblastoma of the TARGET NBL cohort. On the SEQC HR patients, CDRP achieves Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) 0.38 for EFS and MCC = 0.19 for OS in external validation, improving over published SEQC models. We show that a CDRP-N embedding is indeed parametrically associated to increasing severity and the embedding can be used to better stratify patients’ survival. © 2018 Maggio et al.

AB  - Understanding metabolic dysregulation in different disease settings is vital for the safe and effective incorporation of metabolism-targeted therapeutics in the clinic. Here, using transcriptomic data for 10,704 tumor and normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, across 26 disease sites, we present a novel bioinformatics pipeline that distinguishes tumor from normal tissues, based on differential gene expression for 114 metabolic pathways. We confirm pathway dysregulation in separate patient populations, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. Bootstrapping simulations were then applied to assess the biological significance of these alterations. We provide distinct examples of the types of analysis that can be accomplished with this tool to understand cancer specific metabolic dysregulation, highlighting novel pathways of interest, and patterns of metabolic flux, in both common and rare disease sites. Further, we show that Master Metabolic Transcriptional Regulators explain why metabolic differences exist, can segregate patient populations, and predict responders to different metabolism-targeted therapeutics. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Knowing which proteins and RNAs directly interact is essential for understanding cellular mechanisms. Unfortunately, discovering such interactions is costly and often unreliable. To overcome these limitations, we developed rec-YnH, a new yeast two and three-hybrid-based screening pipeline capable of detecting interactions within protein libraries or between protein libraries and RNA fragment pools. rec-YnH combines batch cloning and transformation with intracellular homologous recombination to generate bait–prey fusion libraries. By developing interaction selection in liquid–gels and using an ORF sequence-based readout of interactions via next-generation sequencing, we eliminate laborious plating and barcoding steps required by existing methods. We use rec-Y2H to simultaneously map interactions of protein domains and reveal novel putative interactors of PAR proteins. We further employ rec-Y2H to predict the architecture of published coprecipitated complexes. Finally, we use rec-Y3H to map interactions between multiple RNA-binding proteins and RNAs—the first time interactions between protein and RNA pools are simultaneously detected. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The biological determinants of sensitivity and resistance to immune checkpoint blockers are not completely understood. To elucidate the role of intratumoral T-cells and their association with the tumor genomic landscape, we perform paired whole exome DNA sequencing and multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) in pre-treatment samples from non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients treated with PD-1 axis blockers. QIF is used to simultaneously measure the level of CD3+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), in situ T-cell proliferation (Ki-67 in CD3) and effector capacity (Granzyme-B in CD3). Elevated mutational load, candidate class-I neoantigens or intratumoral CD3 signal are significantly associated with favorable response to therapy. Additionally, a “dormant” TIL signature is associated with survival benefit in patients treated with immune checkpoint blockers characterized by elevated TILs with low activation and proliferation. We further demonstrate that dormant TILs can be reinvigorated upon PD-1 blockade in a patient-derived xenograft model. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that infect humans and animals. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been applied as a live vaccine for immunization against smallpox, which was eradicated by 1980 as a result of worldwide vaccination. VACV is the prototype of poxviruses in the investigation of the molecular pathogenesis of the virus. Short-read sequencing methods have revolutionized transcriptomics; however, they are not efficient in distinguishing between the RNA isoforms and transcript overlaps. Long-read sequencing (LRS) is much better suited to solve these problems and also allow direct RNA sequencing. Despite the scientific relevance of VACV, no LRS data have been generated for the viral transcriptome to date. Findings: For the deep characterization of the VACV RNA profile, various LRS platforms and library preparation approaches were applied. The raw reads were mapped to the VACV reference genome and also to the host (Chlorocebus sabaeus) genome. In this study, we applied the Pacific Biosciences RSII and Sequel platforms, which altogether resulted in 937,531 mapped reads of inserts (1.42 Gb), while we obtained 2,160,348 aligned reads (1.75 Gb) from the different library preparation methods using the MinION device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Conclusions: By applying cutting-edge technologies, we were able to generate a large dataset that can serve as a valuable resource for the investigation of the dynamic VACV transcriptome, the virus-host interactions, and RNA base modifications. These data can provide useful information for novel gene annotations in the VACV genome. Our dataset can also be used to analyze the currently available LRS platforms, library preparation methods, and bioinformatics pipelines.

AB  - Argonaute crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments are the most widely used high-throughput methodologies for miRNA targetome characterization. The analysis of Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside-Enhanced (PAR) CLIP methodology focuses on sequence clusters containing T-to-C conversions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the non-T-to-C clusters, frequently observed in PAR-CLIP experiments, exhibit functional miRNA-binding events and strong RNA accessibility. This discovery is based on the analysis of an extensive compendium of bona fide miRNA-binding events, and is further supported by numerous miRNA perturbation experiments and structural sequencing data. The incorporation of these previously neglected clusters yields an average of 14% increase in miRNA-target interactions per PAR-CLIP library. Our findings are integrated in microCLIP (www.microrna.gr/microCLIP), a cutting-edge framework that combines deep learning classifiers under a super learning scheme. The increased performance of microCLIP in CLIP-Seq-guided detection of miRNA interactions, uncovers previously elusive regulatory events and miRNA-controlled pathways. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Knowledge of connections between operational conditions, process stability, and microbial community dynamics is essential to enhance anaerobic digestion (AD) process efficiency and management. In this study, the detailed temporal effects of a sudden glycerol-based organic overloading on the AD microbial community and process imbalance were investigated in two replicate anaerobic digesters by a time-intensive sampling scheme. The microbial community time response to the overloading event was shorter than the shifts of reactor performance parameters. An increase in bacterial community dynamics and in the abundances of several microbial taxa, mainly within the Firmicutes, Tenericutes, and Chloroflexi phyla and Methanoculleus genera, could be detected prior to any shift on the reactor operational parameters. Reactor acidification already started within the first 24 h of the shock and headed the AD process to total inhibition in 72 h alongside with the largest shifts on microbiome, mostly the increase of Anaerosinus sp. and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic Archaea. In sum, this work proved that AD microbial community reacts very quickly to an organic overloading and some shifts occur prior to alterations on the performance parameters. The latter is very interesting as it can be used to improve AD process management protocols. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Metastases and tumor recurrence have a major prognostic impact in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC); however, cellular models that comprehensively characterize metastatic and recurrent HNSCC are lacking. To this end, we obtained genomic, transcriptomic, and copy number profiles of the UM-SCC cell line panel, encompassing patient-matched metastatic and recurrent cells. UM-SCC cells recapitulate the most prevalent genomic alterations described in HNSCC, featuring common TP53, PI3K, NOTCH, and Hippo pathway mutations. This analysis identified a novel F977Y kinase domain PIK3CA mutation exclusively present in a recurrent cell line (UM-SCC14B), potentially conferring resistance to PI3K inhibitors. Small proline-rich protein 2A (SPRR2A), a protein involved in epithelial homeostasis and invasion, was one of the most consistently downregulated transcripts in metastatic and recurrent UM-SCC cells. Assessment of SPRR2A protein expression in a clinical cohort of patients with HNSCC confirmed common SPRR2A downregulation in primary tumors (61.9% of cases) and lymph node metastases (31.3%), but not in normal tissue. High expression of SPRR2A in lymph node metastases was, along with nonoropharyngeal location of the primary tumor, an independent prognostic factor for regional disease recurrence after surgery and radiotherapy (HR 2.81; 95% CI, 1.16–6.79; P ¼ 0.02). These results suggest that SPRR2A plays a dual role in invasion and therapeutic resistance in HNSCC, respectively through its downregulation and overexpression. Implications: The current study reveals translationally relevant mechanisms underlying metastasis and recurrence in HNSCC and represents an adjuvant tool for preclinical research in this disease setting. Underlining its discovery potential this approach identified a PIK3CA-resistant mutation as well as SPRR2A as possible theragnostic markers. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorders encompassing wide classification of intellectual disabilities (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In the present study, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in three unrelated patients with developmental delay, hypotonia and ID. We found novel heterozygous mutations in two ID and ASD associated genes namely POGZ and KMT2D (c.1918C>CT (p.R640RC) in the POGZ, c.14531 delG (p.G4844Vfs*13) and c.13818C>CG (p.Y4606YX) in the KMT2D genes). Segregation analysis showed all three mutations are de novo mutations. Our data add information to the available literature and enlightens a new era of genotype-phenotype correlation. Molecular genetic testing will accelerate and simplify genetic counseling and promote accurate and immediate prognostic information allowing patients to benefit from precise diagnosis and risk assessment schemes for further conception. © 2018

AB  - Cancer is thought to arise through the accumulation of genomic aberrations evolving under Darwinian selection. However, it remains unclear when the aberrations associated with metastasis emerge during tumor evolution. Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary eye cancer and frequently leads to metastatic death, which is strongly linked to BAP1 mutations. Accordingly, UM is ideally suited for studying the clonal evolution of metastatic competence. Here we analyze sequencing data from 151 primary UM samples using a customized bioinformatic pipeline, to improve detection of BAP1 mutations and infer the clonal relationships among genomic aberrations. Strikingly, we find BAP1 mutations and other canonical genomic aberrations usually arise in an early punctuated burst, followed by neutral evolution extending to the time of clinical detection. This implies that the metastatic proclivity of UM is "set in stone" early in tumor evolution and may explain why advances in primary treatment have not improved survival. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Congenital hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (CHH) is a challenging inherited endocrine disorder characterised by absent or incomplete pubertal development and infertility as a result of the low action/secretion of the hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Given a growing list of gene mutations accounting for CHH, the application of massively parallel sequencing comprises an excellent molecular diagnostic approach because it enables the simultaneous evaluation of many genes. The present study proposes the use of whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify causative and modifying mutations based on a phenotype-genotype CHH analysis using an in-house exome pipeline. Based on 44 known genes related to CHH in humans, we were able to identify a novel homozygous gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR) p.Thr269Met mutant, which segregates with the CHH kindred and was predicted to be deleterious by in silico analysis. A functional study measuring intracellular inositol phosphate (IP) when stimulated with GnRH on COS-7 cells confirmed that the p.Thr269Met GnRHR mutant performed greatly diminished IP accumulation relative to the transfected wild-type GnRHR. Additionally, the proband carries three heterozygous variants in CCDC141 and one homozygous in SEMA3A gene, although their effects with respect to modifying the phenotype are uncertain. Because they do not segregate with reproductive phenotype in family members, we advocate they do not contribute to CHH oligogenicity. WES proved to be useful for CHH molecular diagnosis and reinforced its benefit with respect to identifying heterogeneous genetic disorders. Our findings expand the GnRHR mutation spectrum and phenotype-genotype correlation in CHH. © 2018 British Society for Neuroendocrinology

AB  - Background: Plasmodium falciparum exhibits resistance to the artemisinin component of the frontline antimalarial treatment Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy in South East Asia. Millions of lives will be at risk if artemisinin resistance (ART-R) spreads to Africa. Single non-synonymous mutations in the propeller region of PF3D7-1343700,"K13" are implicated in resistance. In this work, we use transcriptional profiling to characterize a laboratory-generated k13 insertional mutant previously demonstrated to have increased sensitivity to artemisinins to explore the functional role of k13. Results: A set of RNA-seq and microarray experiments confirmed that the expression profile of k13 is specifically altered during the early ring and early trophozoite stages of the mutant intraerythrocytic development cycle. The down-regulation of k13 transcripts in this mutant during the early ring stage is associated with a transcriptome advance towards a more trophozoite-like state. To discover the specific downstream effect of k13 dysregulation, we developed a new computational method to search for differential gene expression while accounting for the temporal sequence of transcription. We found that the strongest biological signature of the transcriptome shift is an up-regulation of DNA replication and repair genes during the early ring developmental stage and a down-regulation of DNA replication and repair genes during the early trophozoite stage; by contrast, the expressions of housekeeping genes are unchanged. This effect, due to k13 dysregulation, is antagonistic, such that k13 levels are negatively correlated with DNA replication and repair gene expression. Conclusion: Our results support a role for k13 as a stress response regulator consistent with the hypothesis that artemisinins mode of action is oxidative stress and k13 as a functional homolog of Keap1 which in humans regulates DNA replication and repair genes in response to oxidative stress. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Testing the dependence of two variables is one of the fundamental tasks in statistics. In this work, we developed an open-source R package (knnAUC) for detecting nonlinear dependence between one continuous variable X and one binary dependent variables Y (0 or 1). Results: We addressed this problem by using knnAUC (k-nearest neighbors AUC test, the R package is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/knnauc/ ). In the knnAUC software framework, we first resampled a dataset to get the training and testing dataset according to the sample ratio (from 0 to 1), and then constructed a k-nearest neighbors algorithm classifier to get the yhat estimator (the probability of y=1) of testy (the true label of testing dataset). Finally, we calculated the AUC (area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic) estimator and tested whether the AUC estimator is greater than 0.5. To evaluate the advantages of knnAUC compared to seven other popular methods, we performed extensive simulations to explore the relationships between eight different methods and compared the false positive rates and statistical power using both simulated and real datasets (Chronic hepatitis B datasets and kidney cancer RNA-seq datasets). Conclusions: We concluded that knnAUC is an efficient R package to test non-linear dependence between one continuous variable and one binary dependent variable especially in computational biology area. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The potential for astrocyte participation in central nervous system recovery is highlighted by in vitro experiments demonstrating their capacity to transdifferentiate into neurons. Understanding astrocyte plasticity could be advanced by comparing astrocytes with stem cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is ideal for comparing differences across cell types. However, this novel multi-stage process has the potential to introduce unwanted technical variation at several points in the experimental workflow. Quantitative understanding of the contribution of experimental parameters to technical variation would facilitate the design of robust RNA-Seq experiments. Results: RNA-Seq was used to achieve biological and technical objectives. The biological aspect compared gene expression between normal human fetal-derived astrocytes and human neural stem cells cultured in identical conditions. When differential expression threshold criteria of |log 2 fold change|&gt;2 were applied to the data, no significant differences were observed. The technical component quantified variation arising from particular steps in the research pathway, and compared the ability of different normalization methods to reduce unwanted variance. To facilitate this objective, a liberal false discovery rate of 10% and a |log 2 fold change|&gt;0.5 were implemented for the differential expression threshold. Data were normalized with RPKM, TMM, and UQS methods using JMP Genomics. The contributions of key replicable experimental parameters (cell lot; library preparation; flow cell) to variance in the data were evaluated using principal variance component analysis. Our analysis showed that, although the variance for every parameter is strongly influenced by the normalization method, the largest contributor to technical variance was library preparation. The ability to detect differentially expressed genes was also affected by normalization; differences were only detected in non-normalized and TMM-normalized data. Conclusions: The similarity in gene expression between astrocytes and neural stem cells supports the potential for astrocytic transdifferentiation into neurons, and emphasizes the need to evaluate the therapeutic potential of astrocytes for central nervous system damage. The choice of normalization method influences the contributions to experimental variance as well as the outcomes of differential expression analysis. However irrespective of normalization method, our findings illustrate that library preparation contributed the largest component of technical variance. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and have been targeted as indicators of environmental/toxicologic stressors. Using the data from our deep sequencing of miRNAs in an extensive sampling of rat tissues, we developed a database called RATEmiRs for the Rat Atlas of Tissue-specific and Enriched miRNAs to allow users to dynamically determine mature-, iso- and pre-miR expression abundance, enrichment and specificity in rat tissues and organs. RESULTS: Illumina sequencing count data from mapped reads and meta data from the miRNA body atlas consisting of 21 and 23 tissues (14 organs) of toxicologic interest from 12 to 13 week old male and female Sprague Dawley rats respectively, were managed in a relational database with a user-friendly query interface. Data-driven pipelines are available to tailor the identification of tissue-enriched (TE) and tissue-specific (TS) miRNAs. Data-driven organ-specific (OS) pipelines reveal miRNAs that are expressed predominately in a given organ. A user-driven approach is also available to assess the tissue expression of user-specified miRNAs. Using one tissue vs other tissues and tissue(s) of an organ vs other organs, we illustrate the utility of RATEmiRs to facilitate the identification of candidate miRNAs. As a use case example, RATEmiRs revealed two TS miRNAs in the liver: rno-miR-122-3p and rno-miR-122-5p. When liver is compared to just the brain tissues for example, rno-miR-192-5p, rno-miR-193-3p, rno-miR-203b-3p, rno-miR-3559-5p, rno-miR-802-3p and rno-miR-802-5p are also detected as abundantly expressed in liver. As another example, 55 miRNAs from the RATEmiRs query of ileum vs brain tissues overlapped with miRNAs identified from the same comparison of tissues in an independent, publicly available dataset of 10 week old male rat microarray data suggesting that these miRNAs are likely not age-specific, platform-specific nor pipeline-dependent. Lastly, we identified 10 miRNAs that have conserved tissue/organ-specific expression between the rat and human species. CONCLUSIONS: RATEmiRs provides a new platform for identification of TE, TS and OS miRNAs in a broad array of rat tissues. RATEmiRs is available at: https://www.niehs.nih.gov/ratemirs.

AB  - Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is characterized by extensive lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary and lacrimal gland (LG), resulting in acinar cell destruction and organ dysfunction. The underlying pathogenesis of SS remains largely unknown, and studies historically focus on defining late-stage disease. Here, we identify tissue programs associated with disease onset using transcriptomic and immunohistological analysis of LGs from 5-and 7-week-old mice deficient in autoimmune response element (Aire). At 5 weeks of age (wk), Aire-/-mice show minimal tissue dysfunction and destruction compared to 7 wk Aire-/-, which exhibit severe dry eye, poor tear secretion, extensive lymphocytic infiltration, reduced functional innervation, and increased vascularization. Despite this mild phenotype, 5 wk Aire-/-LGs were highly enriched for signaling pathways previously associated with SS, including interferon gamma (IFNγ), interleukin 1 beta (IL1β), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, and interleukin-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL6/STAT3) signaling. Novel signaling pathways such as the semaphorin–plexin pathway were also noted. Intriguingly, we found an expansion of the ductal network with increasing disease. Activated STAT3, a blocker of apoptosis, was restricted to the ductal system and also increased with damage, highlighting its potential as a promoter of ductal cell survival. These data demonstrate the early activation of signaling pathways regulating inflammation, innervation, and cell survival before the onset of clinical disease indicators, suggesting their potential value as diagnostic biomarkers. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Motivation In recent years, Transposable Elements (TEs) have been related to gene regulation. However, estimating the origin of expression of TEs through RNA-seq is complicated by multi-mapping reads coming from their repetitive sequences. Current approaches that address multi-mapping reads are focused in expression quantification and not in finding the origin of expression. Addressing the genomic origin of expressed TEs could further aid in understanding the role that TEs might have in the cell. Results We have developed a new pipeline called TEcandidates, based on de novo transcriptome assembly to assess the instances of TEs being expressed, along with their location, to include in downstream DE analysis. TEcandidates takes as input the RNA-seq data, the genome sequence and the TE annotation file and returns a list of coordinates of candidate TEs being expressed, the TEs that have been removed and the genome sequence with removed TEs as masked. This masked genome is suited to include TEs in downstream expression analysis, as the ambiguity of reads coming from TEs is significantly reduced in the mapping step of the analysis.

AB  - Motivation Alternative splicing (AS) has been demonstrated to play a role in shaping eukaryotic gene diversity at the transcriptional level. However, the impact of AS on the proteome is still controversial. Studies that seek to explore the effect of AS at the proteomic level are hampered by technical difficulties in the cumbersome process of casting forth and back between genome, transcriptome and proteome space coordinates, and the naïve prediction of protein domains in the presence of AS suffers many redundant sequence scans that emerge from constitutively spliced regions that are shared between alternative products of a gene. Results We developed the AstaFunk pipeline that computes for every generic transcriptome all domains that are altered by AS events in a systematic and efficient manner. In a nutshell, our method employs Viterbi dynamic programming, which guarantees to find all score-optimal hits of the domains under consideration, while complementary optimizations at different levels avoid redundant and other irrelevant computations. We evaluate AstaFunk qualitatively and quantitatively using RNAseq in well-studied genes with AS, and on large-scale employing entire transcriptomes. Our study confirms complementary reports that the effect of most AS events on the proteome seems to be rather limited, but our results also pinpoint several cases where AS could have a major impact on the function of a protein domain.

AB  - Background: A widely applied approach to extract knowledge from high-throughput genomic data is clustering of gene expression profiles followed by functional enrichment analysis. This type of analysis, when done manually, is highly subjective and has limited reproducibility. Moreover, this pipeline can be very time-consuming and resource-demanding as enrichment analysis is done for tens to hundreds of clusters at a time. Thus, the task often needs programming skills to form a pipeline of different software tools or R packages to enable an automated approach. Furthermore, visualising the results can be challenging. Results: We developed a web tool, funcExplorer, which automatically combines hierarchical clustering and enrichment analysis to detect functionally related gene clusters. The functional characterisation is achieved using structured knowledge from data sources such as Gene Ontology, KEGG and Reactome pathways, Human Protein Atlas, and Human Phenotype Ontology. funcExplorer includes various measures for finding biologically meaningful clusters, provides a modern graphical user interface, and has wide-ranging data export and sharing options as well as software transparency by open-source code. The results are presented in a visually compact and interactive format, enabling users to explore the biological essence of the data. We compared our results with previously published gene clusters to demonstrate that funcExplorer can perform the data characterisation equally well, but without requiring labour-intensive manual interference. Conclusions: The open-source web tool funcExplorer enables scientists with high-throughput genomic data to obtain a preliminary interactive overview of the expression patterns, gene names, and shared functionalities in their dataset in a visually pleasing format. funcExplorer is publicly available at https://biit.cs.ut.ee/funcexplorer © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Multi-region sequencing is used to detect intratumor genetic heterogeneity (ITGH) in tumors. To assess whether genuine ITGH can be distinguished from sequencing artifacts, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on three anatomically distinct regions of the same tumor with technical replicates to estimate technical noise. Somatic variants were detected with three different WES pipelines and subsequently validated by high-depth amplicon sequencing. The cancer-only pipeline was unreliable, with about 69% of the identified somatic variants being false positive. Even with matched normal DNA for which 82% of the somatic variants were detected reliably, only 36%–78% were found consistently in technical replicate pairs. Overall, 34%–80% of the discordant somatic variants, which could be interpreted as ITGH, were found to constitute technical noise. Excluding mutations affecting low-mappability regions or occurring in certain mutational contexts was found to reduce artifacts, yet detection of subclonal mutations by WES in the absence of orthogonal validation remains unreliable. Shi et al. report that standard coverage whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines cannot discriminate between genuine intratumor genetic heterogeneity and sequencing artifacts. Although aggressive minimum depth filtering would not improve the false detection rate of subclonal mutations, excluding mutations in low-mappability regions or in certain mutational contexts could help. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - With the increasing number of studies focusing on PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNAs), it is now pertinent to develop efficient tools dedicated towards piRNA analysis. We have developed a novel cluster prediction tool called PILFER (PIrna cLuster FindER), which can accurately predict piRNA clusters from small RNA sequencing data. PILFER is an open source, easy to use tool, and can be executed even on a personal computer with minimum resources. It uses a sliding-window mechanism by integrating the expression of the reads along with the spatial information to predict the piRNA clusters. We have additionally defined a piRNA analysis pipeline incorporating PILFER to detect and annotate piRNAs and their clusters from raw small RNA sequencing data and implemented it on publicly available data from healthy germline and somatic tissues. We compared PILFER with other existing piRNA cluster prediction tools and found it to be statistically more accurate and superior in many aspects such as the robustness of PILFER clusters is higher and memory efficiency is more. Overall, PILFER provides a fast and accurate solution to piRNA cluster prediction. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although differential gene expression (DGE) profiling in RNA-seq is used by many researchers, new packages and pipelines are continuously being presented as a result of an ongoing investigation. In this work, a geometric approach based on Supervised Variational Relevance Learning (Suvrel) was compared with DEpackages (edgeR, DESEq, baySeq, PoissonSeq, and limma) in the DGE profiling. The Suvrel method seeks to determine the relevance of characteristics (e.g., gene or transcript) based on intraclass and interclass distances. The comparison was performed using technical and biological replicates. For technical replicates, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, while for the other ones, we used robustness analysis. From ROC analysis, we found that geometric approach had a better performance than the DEpackages. Particularly, for a reduced list of differentially expressed genes (DEG), we noticed that this method had a remarkable advantage in ranking of most DEG (with a specificity ranging from 1 to 0.8). From robustness analysis associated to biological replicates, we found that geometric approach has comparable performance to the DEpackages. We conclude that the geometric approach had a slight overall better performance than the other methods. Moreover, it is a simple method that does not make any assumption about the distribution associated with RNA-seq data set. From this perspective, the relevance of this study was to show that a simple method can provide as good performance as more complex methods. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018.

AB  - Inflorescence capacity plays a crucial role in reproductive fitness in plants, and in production of hybrid crops. Maize is a monoecious species bearing separate male and female flowers (tassel and ear, respectively). The switch from open-pollinated populations of maize to hybrid-based breeding schemes in the early 20th century was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in tassel size, and the trend has continued with modern breeding over the recent decades. The goal of this study was to identify selection signatures in genes that may underlie this dramatic transformation. Using a population of 942 diverse inbred maize accessions and a nested association mapping population comprising three 200-line biparental populations, we measured 15 tassel morphological characteristics by manual and image-based methods. Genome-wide association studies identified 242 single nucleotide polymor-phisms significantly associated with measured traits. We compared 41 unselected lines from the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS) population to 21 highly selected lines developed by modern commercial breeding programs, and found that tassel size and weight were reduced significantly. We assayed genetic differences between the two groups using three selection statistics: cross population extended haplotype homozogysity, cross-population composite likelihood ratio, and fixation index. All three statistics show evidence of selection at genomic regions associated with tassel morphology relative to genome-wide null distributions. These results support the tremendous effect, both phenotypic and genotypic, that selection has had on maize male inflorescence morphology. © 2018 J. L. Gage et al.

AB  - Importance: Dual anti-HER2 blockade increased the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in the Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimisation (NeoALTTO) trial, and high immune gene expression was associated with pCR in all treatment arms. So far, no marker has been identified that is specifically associated with the benefit from dual HER2 blockade. Objective: To examine if use of the T-cell β chain variable genes adds to the potential association of immune gene signatures with response to dual HER2 blockade. Design, Setting, and Participants: In the NeoALTTO trial, HER2-positive patients recruited between January 5, 2008, and May 27, 2010, were treated with paclitaxel plus either lapatinib or trastuzumab or both as neoadjuvant therapy. In this study, RNA sequencing data from baseline tumor specimens of 245 patients in the NeoALTTO trial were analyzed and reads were aligned to TRBV gene reference sequences using a previously published Basic Local Alignment Search Tool T-cell receptor mapping pipeline. Total TRBV gene use, Shannon entropy, and gene richness were calculated for each tumor, and nonnegative matrix factorization was used to define TRBV co-use metagenes (TMGs). The association between TRBV metrics, tumor genomic metrics, and response was assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Statistical analysis was performed from January 23 to December 2, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between TRBV use metrics and pCR. Results: Among the 245 women with available data (mean [SD] age, 49 [11] years), total TRBV use correlated positively with a gene expression signature for immune activity (Spearman ρ = 0.93; P < .001). High use of TRBV11-3 and TMG2, characterized by high use of TRBV4.3, TRBV6.3, and TRBV7.2, was associated with a higher rate of pCR to dual HER2-targeted therapy (TRBV11-3 interaction: odds ratio, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.22-6.47]; P = .02; TMG2 interaction: odds ratio, 3.39 [95% CI, 1.57-8.27]; P = .004). Immune-rich cancers with high TMG2 levels (n = 92) had significantly better response to dual HER2-targeted treatment compared with the single therapy arms (rate of pCR, 68% [95% CI, 52%-83%] vs 21% [95% CI, 10%-31%]; P < .001), whereas those with low TMG2 levels did not benefit from dual therapy. High TMG2 levels were also associated with a higher rate of pCR to the combined therapy in immune-poor tumors (n = 30; pCR, 50% [95% CI, 22%-78%] vs 6% [95% CI, 0%-16%]; P = .009). Conclusions and Relevance: Use patterns of TRBV genes potentially provide information about the association with response to dual HER2 blockade beyond immune gene signatures. High use of TRBV11.3 or TRBV4.3, TRBV6.3, and TRBV7.2 identifies patients who have a better response to dual HER2 targeted therapy. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00553358.

AB  - Background: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a global public health problem, which increases in prevalence every year. Evidence brings up that small populations of stem cells, the cancer stem cells (CSC), are responsible for tumour initiation, tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis. These cells play a crucial role in cancer development and treatment response, but the origin of CSCs remains unclear. In this research, we have sequenced the entire exome of the three different groups of cells of primary squamous cell carcinoma tumour from different patients, with the aim to understand their main genetic changes and to elucidate the possible origin of tumour cells and tumour stem cells. Material and Methods: We performed a whole exome sequencing in the germinal line, tumour cells, and CSC ALDH+ samples from four HNSCC patients. An analysis pipeline was used to filter, score, rank, and prioritize candidate variants according to its effect on protein structure and phylogenetic conservation using available information on pathways and protein function databases. Results: Results showed variations in genes involved in oncogenic pathways and shed light on the evolution model of the CSC and tumour cells for each patient in which stem cells (CS) triggered the formation of CSC and these in turn become tumour cells. Conclusions: These findings support the idea that it is possible to identify in each individual patient if the CS are of tumour origin or vice versa, thus being possible a more personalized treatment. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Whole-genome sequencing is increasingly used to identify Mendelian variants in clinical pipelines. These pipelines focus on single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and also structural variants, while ignoring more complex repeat sequence variants. Here, we consider the problem of genotyping Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs), composed of inexact tandem duplications of short (6-100 bp) repeating units. VNTRs span 3% of the human genome, are frequently present in coding regions, and have been implicated in multiple Mendelian disorders. Although existing tools recognize VNTR carrying sequence, genotyping VNTRs (determining repeat unit count and sequence variation) from whole-genome sequencing reads remains challenging. We describe a method, adVNTR, that uses hidden Markov models to model each VNTR, count repeat units, and detect sequence variation. adVNTR models can be developed for short-read (Illumina) and single-molecule (Pacific Biosciences [PacBio]) whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, and show good results on multiple simulated and real data sets. © 2018 Zhang et al.

AB  - Background: Detection of copy number variants (CNVs) is an important aspect of clinical testing for several disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and is often performed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). However, since many genetic carrier screens depend instead on next-generation sequencing (NGS) for wider discovery of small variants, they often do not include CNV analysis. Moreover, most computational techniques developed to detect CNVs from exome sequencing data are not suitable for carrier screening, as they require matched normals, very large cohorts, or extensive gene panels. Methods: We present a computational software package, geneCNV (http://github.com/vkozareva/geneCNV), which can identify exon-level CNVs using exome sequencing data from only a few genes. The tool relies on a hierarchical parametric model trained on a small cohort of reference samples. Results: Using geneCNV, we accurately inferred heterozygous CNVs in the DMD gene across a cohort of 15 test subjects. These results were validated against MLPA, the current standard for clinical CNV analysis in DMD. We also benchmarked the tool's performance against other computational techniques and found comparable or improved CNV detection in DMD using data from panels ranging from 4,000 genes to as few as 8 genes. Conclusions: geneCNV allows for the creation of cost-effective screening panels by allowing NGS sequencing approaches to generate results equivalent to bespoke genotyping assays like MLPA. By using a parametric model to detect CNVs, it also fulfills regulatory requirements to define a reference range for a genetic test. It is freely available and can be incorporated into any Illumina sequencing pipeline to create clinical assays for detection of exon duplications and deletions. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in the goose embryo transcriptome during feather development. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to find the transcriptome profiles of feather follicles from three stages of embryonic dorsal skin at embryonic day 13, 18, and 28 (E13, E18, E28). The results showed that 3001, 6634, and 13,780 genes were differently expressed in three stages. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in E13 vs. E18 were significantly mapped into the GO term of extracellular structure organization and the pathway of extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction. In E18 vs. E28, the top significantly mapped into GO term was the single-organism developmental process; the pathway was also the ECM-receptor interaction. DEGs in E13 vs. E28 were significantly mapped into the GO term of the multicellular organismal process and the pathway of cell adhesion molecules. Subsequently, the union of DEGs was categorized by succession cluster into eight profiles, which were then grouped into four ideal profiles. Lastly, the seven genes spatio-temporal expression pattern was confirmed by real-time PCR. Our findings advocate that interleukin 20 receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA), interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R), interleukin 1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), Wnt family member 3A (WNT3A), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7), and secreted-frizzled related protein 2 (SFRP2) might possibly play vital roles in skin and feather follicle development and growth processes. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an orphan disease that is difficult to treat using traditional chemotherapy, an approach which has been effective in other types of cancer. Most chemotherapeutics cause DNA damage leading to cell death. Recent discoveries have highlighted a potential role for the p53 tumor suppressor in this disease. Given the pivotal role of p53 in the DNA damage response, here we investigated the predictive power of the p53 interactome model for MPM patients' stratification. Methods: We used bioinformatics approaches including omics type analysis of data from MPM cells and from MPM patients in order to predict which pathways are crucial for patients' survival. Analysis of the PKT206 model of the p53 network was validated by microarrays from the Mero-14 MPM cell line and RNA-seq data from 71 MPM patients, whilst statistical analysis was used to identify the deregulated pathways and predict therapeutic schemes by linking the affected pathway with the patients' clinical state. Results: In silico simulations demonstrated successful predictions ranging from 52 to 85% depending on the drug, algorithm or sample used for validation. Clinical outcomes of individual patients stratified in three groups and simulation comparisons identified 30 genes that correlated with survival. In patients carrying wild-type p53 either treated or not treated with chemotherapy, FEN1 and MMP2 exhibited the highest inverse correlation, whereas in untreated patients bearing mutated p53, SIAH1 negatively correlated with survival. Numerous repositioned and experimental drugs targeting FEN1 and MMP2 were identified and selected drugs tested. Epinephrine and myricetin, which target FEN1, have shown cytotoxic effect on Mero-14 cells whereas marimastat and batimastat, which target MMP2 demonstrated a modest but significant inhibitory effect on MPM cell migration. Finally, 8 genes displayed correlation with disease stage, which may have diagnostic implications. Conclusions: Clinical decisions related to MPM personalized therapy based on individual patients' genetic profile and previous chemotherapeutic treatment could be reached using computational tools and the predictions reported in this study upon further testing in animal models. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Testis development is a vital and tightly regulated process in mammals. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying testis development will benefit the animal reproduction industry. Expression changes in microRNA and messenger RNA in response to dynamic regulation effects have been associated with this process. However, very little is known about the roles of these molecules in yak development. Using whole-genome small RNA and messenger RNA sequencing, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the microRNA–messenger RNA interaction network expression in the testicles of Tianzhu white yaks during three developmental stages. Using Short Time-series Expression Miner analysis we identified 589 differentially expressed microRNAs (DERs) and 3383 differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DEGs) in the three age groups. A total of 93 unique DEGs are primarily involved in reproduction and testis development. Subsequently, four integration networks were constructed according to the DEGs and DERs in three biological processes. Nineteen DEGs were potentially regulated by 60 DERs, of which miR-574 and target gene AURKA played a crucial role in yak testis development and reproduction. The results of this study provide a basis for further exploration of the microRNA–messenger RNA interactions in testis development and reproduction and aid in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of spermatogenesis in male mammals. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Developmental neuronal remodeling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism required for precise wiring of nervous systems. Despite its fundamental role in neurodevelopment and proposed contribution to various neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we uncover the fine temporal transcriptional landscape of Drosophila mushroom body γ neurons undergoing stereotypical remodeling. Our data reveal rapid and dramatic changes in the transcriptional landscape during development. Focusing on DNA binding proteins, we identify eleven that are required for remodeling. Furthermore, we sequence developing γ neurons perturbed for three key transcription factors required for pruning. We describe a hierarchical network featuring positive and negative feedback loops. Superimposing the perturbation-seq on the developmental expression atlas highlights a framework of transcriptional modules that together drive remodeling. Overall, this study provides a broad and detailed molecular insight into the complex regulatory dynamics of developmental remodeling and thus offers a pipeline to dissect developmental processes via RNA profiling. Developmental processes are often transcriptionally regulated. Alyagor et al. dissected the transcriptional landscape of a distinct neuronal type undergoing stereotypical remodeling in fine-grained temporal resolution. Superimposing this developmental expression atlas on profiles of neurons mutant for key transcription factors revealed a hierarchical regulatory network. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - Unintended off-target mutations induced by CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases may result in unwanted consequences, which will impede the efficient applicability of this technology for genetic improvement. We have recently edited the goat genome through CRISPR/Cas9 by targeting MSTN and FGF5, which increased muscle fiber diameter and hair fiber length, respectively. Using family trio-based sequencing that allow better discrimination of variant origins, we herein generated offspring from edited goats, and sequenced the members of four family trios (gene-edited goats and their offspring) to an average of ∼36.8× coverage. This data was to systematically examined for mutation profiles using a stringent pipeline that comprehensively analyzed the sequence data for de novo single nucleotide variants, indels, and structural variants from the genome. Our results revealed that the incidence of de novo mutations in the offspring was equivalent to normal populations. We further conducted RNA sequencing using muscle and skin tissues from the offspring and control animals, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were related to muscle fiber development in muscles, skin development, and immune responses in skin tissues. Furthermore, in contrast to recently reports of Cas9 triggered p53 expression alterations in cultured cells, we provide primary evidence to show that Cas9-mediated genetic modification does not induce apparent p53 expression changes in animal tissues. This work provides adequate molecular evidence to support the reliability of conducting Cas9-mediated genome editing in large animal models for biomedicine and agriculture. © 2018 Li, Zhou, Li, Li, Ding, Li, Liu, Qu, Sonstegard, Huang, Jiang, Chen, Petersen and Wang.

AB  - Circular RNA (circRNA) is an important member of non-coding RNA family. Numerous computational methods for detecting circRNAs from RNA-seq data have been developed in the past few years, but there are dramatic differences among the algorithms regarding the balancing of the sensitivity and precision of the detection and filtering strategies. To further improve the sensitivity, while maintaining an acceptable precision of circRNA detection, a novel and efficient de novo detection algorithm, CIRCPlus, is proposed in this paper. CIRCPlus accurately locates circRNA candidates by identifying a set of back-spliced junction reads by comparing the local similar sequence of each pair of spanning junction reads. This strategy, thus, utilizes the important information provided by unbalanced spanning reads, which facilitates the detection especially when the expression levels of circRNA are unapparent. The performance of CIRCPlus was tested and compared to the existing de novo methods on the real datasets as well as a series of simulation datasets with different configurations. The experiment results demonstrated that the sensitivities of CIRCPlus were able to reach 90% in common simulation settings, while CIRCPlus held balanced sensitivity and reliability on the real datasets according to an objective assessment criteria based on RNase R-treated samples. The software tool is available for academic uses only. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - TAL1/SCL is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). TAL1 and its regulatory partners (GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB) positively regulate each other and coordinately regulate the expression of their downstream target genes in T-ALL cells. However, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulated by these factors are largely unknown. Here we established a bioinformatics pipeline and analyzed RNA-seq datasets with deep coverage to identify lncRNAs regulated by TAL1 in T-ALL cells. Our analysis predicted 57 putative lncRNAs that are activated by TAL1. Many of these transcripts were regulated by GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB in a coordinated manner. We identified two novel transcripts that were activated in multiple T-ALL cell samples but were downregulated in normal thymocytes. One transcript near the ARID5B gene locus was specifically expressed in TAL1-positive T-ALL cases. The other transcript located between the FAM49A and MYCN gene locus was also expressed in normal hematopoietic stem cells and T-cell progenitor cells. In addition, we identified a subset of lncRNAs that were negatively regulated by TAL1 and positively regulated by E-proteins in T-ALL cells. This included a known lncRNA (lnc-OAZ3-2:7) located near the RORC gene, which was expressed in normal thymocytes but repressed in TAL1-positive T-ALL cells. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The structural flexibility of RNA underlies fundamental biological processes, but there are no methods for exploring the multiple conformations adopted by RNAs in vivo. We developed cross-linking of matched RNAs and deep sequencing (COMRADES) for in-depth RNA conformation capture, and a pipeline for the retrieval of RNA structural ensembles. Using COMRADES, we determined the architecture of the Zika virus RNA genome inside cells, and identified multiple site-specific interactions with human noncoding RNAs. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

AB  - Motivation: De novo transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq offers a promising means to study gene expression in non-model organisms. Yet, the difficulty of transcriptome assembly means that the contigs provided by the assembler often represent a fractured and incomplete view of the transcriptome, complicating downstream analysis. We introduce Grouper, a new method for clustering contigs from de novo assemblies that are likely to belong to the same transcripts and genes; these groups can subsequently be analyzed more robustly. When provided with access to the genome of a related organism, Grouper can transfer annotations to the de novo assembly, further improving the clustering. Results: On de novo assemblies from four different species, we show that Grouper is able to accurately cluster a larger number of contigs than the existing state-of-the-art method. TheGrouper pipeline is able to map greater than 10% more reads against the contigs, leading to accurate downstreamdifferential expression analyses. The labeling module, in the presence of a closely related annotated genome, can efficiently transfer annotations to the contigs and use this information to further improve clustering. Overall, Grouper provides a complete and efficient pipeline for processing de novo transcriptomic assemblies. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The plating coral, Agaricia lamarcki is a widely distributed species inhabiting reefs across the Caribbean basin and Florida. This species is of interest since it is considered a depth-generalist, found from 10 to 70 m. Given the scope of contemporary studies on this coral's population dynamics and physiology, as well as, the potential of mesophotic reefs to be refuge habitats for deteriorated shallow water reefs, we present the first de novo transcriptome assembly of an important mesophotic coral. Using next-generation paired-end sequencing (Illumina Hiseq4000; 2 × 150 bp), we obtained a total of 82,506,058 raw reads. The novel transcriptome assembly strategy included the recently developed National Center for Genome Analysis Support de novo transcriptome assembly pipeline. Assembly produced a total of 101,322 biologically true, non-redundant transcripts with an average contig length of 959 and N50 of 1830. EvidentialGene and TransDecoder were used to identify open reading frames (ORFs) with homology insight provided by the UniProtKb and PFAM databases. ORF prediction resulted in 38,517 putative ORFs of which 12,107 ORFs were annotated as genes dealing with molecular function, 1266 with biological processes and 416 with cellular components. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the hippocampus, the classical pyramidal cell type of the subiculum acts as a primary output, conveying hippocampal signals to a diverse suite of downstream regions. Accumulating evidence suggests that the subiculum pyramidal cell population may actually be comprised of discrete subclasses. Here, we investigated the extent and organizational principles governing pyramidal cell heterogeneity throughout the mouse subiculum. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we find that the subiculum pyramidal cell population can be deconstructed into eight separable subclasses. These subclasses were mapped onto abutting spatial domains, ultimately producing a complex laminar and columnar organization with heterogeneity across classical dorsal-ventral, proximal-distal, and superficial-deep axes. We further show that these transcriptomically defined subclasses correspond to differential protein products and can be associated with specific projection targets. This work deconstructs the complex landscape of subiculum pyramidal cells into spatially segregated subclasses that may be observed, controlled, and interpreted in future experiments. © Cembrowski et al.

AB  - Hylobius abietis (Linnaeus), or large pine weevil (Coleoptera, Curculionidae), is a pest of European coniferous forests. In order to gain understanding of the functional physiology of this species, we have assembled a de novo transcriptome of H. abietis, from sequence data obtained by Next Generation Sequencing. In particular, we have identified genes encoding neuropeptides, peptide hormones and their putative G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to gain insights into neuropeptide-modulated processes. The transcriptome was assembled de novo from pooled paired-end, sequence reads obtained from RNA from whole adults, gut and central nervous system tissue samples. Data analysis was performed on the transcripts obtained from the assembly including, annotation, gene ontology and functional assignment as well as transcriptome completeness assessment and KEGG pathway analysis. Pipelines were created using Bioinformatics tools and techniques for prediction and identification of neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors. Peptidomic analysis was also carried out using a combination of MALDI-TOF as well as Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry to confirm the identified neuropeptide. 41 putative neuropeptide families were identified in H. abietis, including Adipokinetic hormone (AKH), CAPA and DH31. Neuropeptide F, which has not been yet identified in the model beetle T. castaneum, was identified. Additionally, 24 putative neuropeptide and 9 leucine-rich repeat containing G protein coupled receptor-encoding transcripts were determined using both alignment as well as non-alignment methods. This information, submitted to the NCBI sequence read archive repository (SRA accession: SRP133355), can now be used to inform understanding of neuropeptide-modulated physiology and behaviour in H. abietis; and to develop specific neuropeptide-based tools for H. abietis control. © 2018

AB  - Musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries are complex phenotypes with genetics being one of many proposed risk factors. Case-control association studies using the candidate gene approach have predominately been used to identify risk loci for these injuries. However, the ability to identify all risk conferring variants using this approach alone is unlikely. Therefore, this study aimed to further define the genetic profile of these injuries using an integrated omics approach involving whole exome sequencing and a customised analyses pipeline. The exomes of ten exemplar asymptomatic controls and ten exemplar cases with Achilles tendinopathy were individually sequenced using a platform that included the coverage of the untranslated regions and miRBase miRNA genes. Approximately 200 000 variants were identified in the sequenced samples. Previous research was used to guide a targeted analysis of the genes encoding the tenascin-C (TNC) glycoprotein and the α1 chain of type XXVII collagen (COL27A1) located on chromosome 9. Selection of variants within these genes were; however, not predetermined but based on a tiered filtering strategy. Four variants in TNC (rs1061494, rs1138545, rs2104772 and rs1061495) and three variants in the upstream COL27A1 gene (rs2567706, rs2241671 and rs2567705) were genotyped in larger Achilles tendinopathy and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture sample groups. The CC genotype of TNC rs1061494 (C/T) was associated with the risk of Achilles tendinopathy (p = 0.018, OR: 2.5 95% CI: 1.2–5.1). Furthermore, the AA genotype of the TNC rs2104772 (A/T) variant was significantly associated with ACL ruptures in the female subgroup (p = 0.035, OR: 2.3 95% CI: 1.1–5.5). An inferred haplotype in the TNC gene was also associated with the risk of Achilles tendinopathy. These results provide a proof of concept for the use of a customised pipeline for the exploration of a larger genomic dataset. This approach, using previous research to guide a targeted analysis of the data has generated new genetic signatures in the biology of musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. © 2018 Gibbon et al.

AB  - Background: The plastid acquisition by secondary endosymbiosis is a driving force for the algal evolution, and the comparative genomics was required to examine the genomic change of symbiont. Therefore, we established a pipeline of a de novo assembly of middle-sized genomes at a low cost and with high quality using long and short reads. Results: We sequenced symbiotic algae Chlorella variabilis using Oxfofrd Nanopore MinION as the long-read sequencer and Illumina HiSeq 4000 as the short-read sequencer and then assembled the genomes under various conditions. Subsequently, we evaluated these assemblies by the gene model quality and RNA-seq mapping rate. We found that long-read only assembly could not be suitable for the comparative genomics studies, but with short reads, we could obtain the acceptable assembly. On the basis of this result, we established the pipeline of de novo assembly for middle-sized algal genome using MinION. Conclusions: The genomic change during the early stages of plastid acquisition can now be revealed by sequencing and comparing many algal genomes. Moreover, this pipeline offers a solution for the assembly of various middle-sized eukaryotic genomes with high-quality and ease. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Detection of coding/functional SNPs that change the biological function of a gene may lead to identification of putative causative alleles within QTL regions and discovery of genetic markers with large effects on phenotypes. This study has two-fold objectives, first to develop, and validate a 50K transcribed gene SNP-chip using RNA-Seq data. To achieve this objective, two bioinformatics pipelines, GATK and SAMtools, were used to identify ~21K transcribed SNPs with allelic imbalances associated with important aquaculture production traits including body weight, muscle yield, muscle fat content, shear force, and whiteness in addition to resistance/susceptibility to bacterial cold-water disease (BCWD). SNPs ere identified from pooled RNA-Seq data collected from ~620 fish, representing 98 families from growth- And 54 families from BCWD-selected lines with divergent phenotypes. In addition, ~29K transcribed SNPs without allelic-imbalances were strategically added to build a 50K Affymetrix SNP-chip. SNPs selected included two SNPs per gene from 14K genes and ~5K non-synonymous SNPs. The SNP-chip was used to genotype 1728 fish. The average SNP calling-rate for samples passing quality control (QC; 1,641 fish) was ≥ 98.5%. The second objective of this study was to test the feasibility of using the new SNP-chip in GWA (Genome-wide association) analysis to identify QTL explaining muscle yield variance. GWA study on 878 fish (representing 197 families from 2 consecutive generations) with muscle yield phenotypes and genotyped for 35K polymorphic markers (passing QC) identified several QTL regions explaining together up to 28.40% of the additive genetic variance for muscle yield in this rainbow trout population. The most significant QTLs were on chromosomes 14 and 16 with 12.71 and 10.49% of the genetic variance, respectively. Many of the annotated genes in the QTL regions were previously reported as important regulators of muscle development and cell signaling. No major QTLs were identified in a previous GWA study using a 57K genomic SNP chip on the same fish population. These results indicate improved detection power of the transcribed gene SNP-chip in the target trait and population, allowing identification of large-effect QTLs for important traits in rainbow trout. © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

AB  - Background: RNA-seq is the most commonly used sequencing application. Not only does it measure gene expression but it is also an excellent media to detect important structural variants such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion (Indels) or fusion transcripts. However, detection of these variants is challenging and complex from RNA-seq. Here we describe a sensitive and accurate analytical pipeline which detects various mutations at once for translational precision medicine. Methods: The pipeline incorporates most sensitive aligners for Indels in RNA-Seq, the best practice for data preprocessing and variant calling, and STAR-fusion is for chimeric transcripts. Variants/mutations are annotated, and key genes can be extracted for further investigation and clinical actions. Three datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the pipeline for SNVs, indels and fusion transcripts. Results: For the well-defined variants from NA12878 by GIAB project, about 95% and 80% of sensitivities were obtained for SNVs and indels, respectively, in matching RNA-seq. Comparison with other variant specific tools showed good performance of the pipeline. For the lung cancer dataset with 41 known and oncogenic mutations, 39 were detected by the pipeline with STAR aligner and all by the GSNAP aligner. An actionable EML4 and ALK fusion was also detected in one of the tumors, which also demonstrated outlier ALK expression. For 9 fusions spiked-into RNA-seq libraries with different concentrations, the pipeline was able to detect all in unfiltered results although some at very low concentrations may be missed when filtering was applied. Conclusions: The new RNA-seq workflow is an accurate and comprehensive mutation profiler from RNA-seq. Key or actionable mutations are reliably detected from RNA-seq, which makes it a practical alternative source for personalized medicine. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming a prevalent approach to quantify gene expression and is expected to gain better insights into a number of biological and biomedical questions compared to DNA microarrays. Most importantly, RNA-seq allows us to quantify expression at the gene or transcript levels. However, leveraging the RNA-seq data requires development of new data mining and analytics methods. Supervised learning methods are commonly used approaches for biological data analysis that have recently gained attention for their applications to RNA-seq data. Here, we assess the utility of supervised learning methods trained on RNA-seq data for a diverse range of biological classification tasks. We hypothesize that the transcript-level expression data are more informative for biological classification tasks than the gene-level expression data. Our large-scale assessment utilizes multiple data sets, organisms, lab groups, and RNA-seq analysis pipelines. Overall, we performed and assessed 61 biological classification problems that leverage three independent RNA-seq data sets and include over 2000 samples that come from multiple organisms, lab groups, and RNA-seq analyses. These 61 problems include predictions of the tissue type, sex, or age of the sample, healthy or cancerous phenotypes, and pathological tumor stages for the samples from the cancerous tissue. For each problem, the performance of three normalization techniques and six machine learning classifiers was explored. We find that for every single classification problem, the transcript-based classifiers outperform or are comparable with gene expression-based methods. The top-performing techniques reached a near perfect classification accuracy, demonstrating the utility of supervised learning for RNA-seq based data analysis. © 2018 Babina et al.

AB  - The quality of RNA sequencing data relies on specific priming by the primer used for reverse transcription (RT-primer). Nonspecific annealing of the RT-primer to the RNA template can generate reads with incorrect cDNA ends and can cause misinterpretation of data (RT mispriming). This kind of artifact in RNA-seq based technologies is underappreciated and currently no adequate tools exist to computationally remove them from published data sets. We show that mispriming can occur with as little as two bases of complementarity at the 3′′ end of the primer followed by intermittent regions of complementarity. We also provide a computational pipeline that identifies cDNA reads produced from RT mispriming, allowing users to filter them out from any aligned data set. Using this analysis pipeline, we identify thousands of mispriming events in a dozen published data sets from diverse technologies including short RNA-seq, total/mRNA-seq, HITS-CLIP, and GRO-seq. We further show how RT mispriming can lead to misinterpretation of data. In addition to providing a solution to computationally remove RT-misprimed reads, we also propose an experimental solution to completely avoid RT-mispriming by performing RNA-seq using thermostable group II intron derived reverse transcriptase (TGIRT-seq). © 2018 Shivram and Iyer

AB  - Numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) identified and characterized in mammals, plants and fungi have been found to play critical regulatory roles in biological processes. However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in oomycete plant pathogens, which cause devastating damage to the economy and ecosystems. We used strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to generate a computational pipeline to identify lncRNAs in Phytophthora sojae, a model oomycete plant pathogen. In total, 940 lncRNAs with 1010 isoforms were identified from RNA-seq data obtained from four representative stages of P. sojae. The lncRNAs had shorter transcript lengths, longer exon lengths, fewer numbers of exons, lower GC content and higher minimum free energy values compared with protein-coding genes. lncRNAs in P. sojae exhibited low sequence conservation amongst oomycetes and P. sojae isolates. Transcriptional data indicated that P. sojae lncRNAs tended to be transcribed in a stage-specific manner; representative lncRNAs were validated by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Phytophthora sojae lncRNAs were concentrated in gene-sparse regions, and lncRNAs were associated with secreted protein and effector coding genes. The neighbouring genes of lncRNAs encoded various effector family members, and RNA-seq data revealed a correlation between the transcription level of lncRNAs and their neighbouring genes. Our results provide the first comprehensive identification of lncRNAs in oomycetes and suggest a potential association between lncRNAs and effector genes. © 2018 BSPP and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Single-cell RNA-seq’s (scRNA-seq) unprecedented cellular resolution at a genome-wide scale enables us to address questions about cellular heterogeneity that are inaccessible using methods that average over bulk tissue extracts. However, scRNA-seq data sets also present additional challenges such as high transcript dropout rates, stochastic transcription events, and complex population substructures. Here, we present a single-cell RNA-seq analysis and klustering evaluation (SAKE), a robust method for scRNA-seq analysis that provides quantitative statistical metrics at each step of the analysis pipeline. Comparing SAKE to multiple single-cell analysis methods shows that most methods perform similarly across a wide range of cellular contexts, with SAKE outperforming these methods in the case of large complex populations. We next applied the SAKE algorithms to identify drug-resistant cellular populations as human melanoma cells respond to targeted BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). Single-cell RNA-seq data from both the Fluidigm C1 and 10x Genomics platforms were analyzed with SAKE to dissect this problem at multiple scales. Data from both platforms indicate that BRAF inhibitor-resistant cells can emerge from rare populations already present before drug application, with SAKE identifying both novel and known markers of resistance. These experimentally validated markers of BRAFi resistance share overlap with previous analyses in different melanoma cell lines, demonstrating the generality of these findings and highlighting the utility of single-cell analysis to elucidate mechanisms of BRAFi resistance. © 2018 Ho et al.

AB  - Gene post-transcription regulation involves several critical regulators such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Accumulated experimental evidences have shown that miRNAs and RBPs can competitively regulate the shared targeting transcripts. Although this establishes a novel post-transcription regulation mechanism, there are currently no computational tools to scan for the possible competing miRNA and RBP pairs. Here, we developed a novel computational pipeline—RBPvsMIR—that enables us to statistically evaluate the competing relationship between miRNAs and RBPs. RBPvsMIR first combines with previously successful miRNAs and RBP motifs discovery applications to search for overlapping or adjacent binding sites along a given RNA sequence. Then a permutation test is performed to select the miRNA and RBP pairs with the significantly enriched binding sites. As an example, we used RBPvsMIR to identify 235 competing RBP-miRNA pairs for long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MALAT1. Wet lab experiments verified that splicing factor SRSF2 competes with miR-383, miR-502 and miR-101 to regulate MALAT1 in esophageal squamous carcinoma cells. Our study also revealed the global mutual exclusive pattern for miRNAs and RBP to regulate human lncRNAs. In addition, we provided a convenient web server (http://bmc.med.stu.edu.cn/RBPvsMIR), which should accelerate the exploration of competing miRNAs and RBP pairs regulating the shared targeting transcripts. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) transcription is controlled by several promoters, which drive expression of multiple transcripts encoding an identical protein. We previously reported that BDNF derived from promoters I and II is highly expressed in hypothalamus and is critical for regulating aggression in male mice. Here we report that BDNF loss from these promoters causes reduced sexual receptivity and impaired maternal care in female mice, which is concomitant with decreased oxytocin (Oxt) expression during development. We identify a novel link between BDNF signaling, oxytocin, and maternal behavior by demonstrating that ablation of TrkB selectively in OXT neurons partially recapitulates maternal care impairments observed in BDNF-deficient females. Using translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA-sequencing we define a molecular profile for OXT neurons and delineate how BDNF signaling impacts gene pathways critical for structural and functional plasticity. Our findings highlight BDNF as a modulator of sexually-dimorphic hypothalamic circuits that govern female-typical behaviors. © Maynard et al.

AB  - MiRNAs regulate the expression of target genes in diverse cellular processes and hence play important roles in different physiological processes, yet little is known about the stomach microRNAome (miRNAome) of the Tibetan pig. The objective of this experiment was to investigate differentially expressed stomach miRNAs participating in digestion. Firstly, we isolated total RNA by Trizol reagent from three Tibetan and three Yorkshire purebred pigs stomach samples at 90-day-old. Secondly, a comprehensive analysis of Tibetan and Yorkshire pig stomach miRNAomes was performed by small RNA sequencing in the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Finally, SYBR Green Real-time RT-PCR was performed to validate the differentially expressed miRNAs. We identified 318 unique miRNAs, 260 were co-expressed in both libraries, 17 and 31 miRNAs were specifically expressed in Tibetan and Yorkshire pigs respectively. Fifty six differentially expressed miRNAs were identified by the identifying differentially expressed genes 6 (IDEG6). Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis revealed that some of the differentially expressed miRNAs were associated with protein and fat digestion. Two differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-214-3p and ssc-un39) participating in the digestion of lipid were identified. Additionally, qRT-PCR results suggested that a higher expression of miR-214-3p in the Tibetan pig stomach could lead to relatively lower expression of calcium-dependent phospholipase A2, which is an enzyme important for the digestion of glycerol phospholipid. This study has delineated the different stomach miRNAs expression patterns of Tibetan and Yorkshire pigs, which would help explain the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in digestion of Tibetan pigs, and contribute to utilize a the unique digestion merits of Tibetan pig in future porcine hybridization breeding. © 2018, The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Clustering of genes and/or samples is a common task in gene expression analysis. The goals in clustering can vary, but an important scenario is that of finding biologically meaningful subtypes within the samples. This is an application that is particularly appropriate when there are large numbers of samples, as in many human disease studies. With the increasing popularity of single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), many more controlled experiments on model organisms are similarly creating large gene expression datasets with the goal of detecting previously unknown heterogeneity within cells. It is common in the detection of novel subtypes to run many clustering algorithms, as well as rely on subsampling and ensemble methods to improve robustness. We introduce a Bioconductor R package, clusterExperiment, that implements a general and flexible strategy we entitle Resampling-based Sequential Ensemble Clustering (RSEC). RSEC enables the user to easily create multiple, competing clusterings of the data based on different techniques and associated tuning parameters, including easy integration of resampling and sequential clustering, and then provides methods for consolidating the multiple clusterings into a final consensus clustering. The package is modular and allows the user to separately apply the individual components of the RSEC procedure, i.e., apply multiple clustering algorithms, create a consensus clustering or choose tuning parameters, and merge clusters. Additionally, clusterExperiment provides a variety of visualization tools for the clustering process, as well as methods for the identification of possible cluster signatures or biomarkers. The R package clusterExperiment is publicly available through the Bioconductor Project, with a detailed manual (vignette) as well as well documented help pages for each function. © 2018 Risso et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

AB  - Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (PRCC) is a heterogeneous disease with variations in disease progression and clinical outcomes. The advent of next generation sequencing techniques (NGS) has generated data from patients that can be analysed to develop a predictive model. In this study, we have adopted a machine learning approach to identify biomarkers and build classifiers to discriminate between early and late stages of PRCC from gene expression profiles. A machine learning pipeline incorporating different feature selection algorithms and classification models is developed to analyse RNA sequencing dataset (RNASeq). Further, to get a reliable feature set, we extracted features from different partitions of the training dataset and aggregated them into feature sets for classification. We evaluated the performance of different algorithms on the basis of 10-fold cross validation and independent test dataset. 10-fold cross validation was also performed on a microarray dataset of PRCC. A random forest based feature selection (varSelRF) yielded minimum number of features (104) and a best performance with area under Precision Recall curve (PR-AUC) of 0.804, MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) of 0.711 and accuracy of 88% with Shrunken Centroid classifier on a test dataset. We identified 80 genes that are consistently altered between stages by different feature selection algorithms. The extracted features are related to cellular components - centromere, kinetochore and spindle, and biological process mitotic cell cycle. These observations reveal potential mechanisms for an increase in chromosome instability in the late stage of PRCC. Our study demonstrates that the gene expression profiles can be used to classify stages of PRCC. © 2018

AB  - Thus far, no systematic studies have examined circRNA expression profiles in the silkworm following B.mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection. To explore the expression patterns of circRNAs in the silkworm midgut following BmNPV infection, circRNAs in normal midguts and BmNPV-infected midguts were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. A total of 353 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed, of which 241 were upregulated and 112 were downregulated following infection. GO annotation and KEGG pathways analyses of these circRNAs showed that many key immunity pathways and metabolism pathways were enriched in the BmNPV-infected midguts. The potential roles of the predicted targets of the miRNAs that interacted with the circRNAs showed that ubiquitin, apoptosis, and endocytosis signaling pathways were enriched significantly by BmNPV infection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Environmental sequencing has greatly expanded our knowledge of micro-eukaryotic diversity and ecology by revealing previously unknown lineages and their distribution. However, the value of these data is critically dependent on the quality of the reference databases used to assign an identity to environmental sequences. Existing databases contain errors and struggle to keep pace with rapidly changing eukaryotic taxonomy, the influx of novel diversity, and computational challenges related to assembling the high-quality alignments and trees needed for accurate characterization of lineage diversity. EukRef (eukref.org) is an ongoing community-driven initiative that addresses these challenges by bringing together taxonomists with expertise spanning the eukaryotic tree of life and microbial ecologists, who use environmental sequence data to develop reliable reference databases across the diversity of microbial eukaryotes. EukRef organizes and facilitates rigorous mining and annotation of sequence data by providing protocols, guidelines, and tools. The EukRef pipeline and tools allow users interested in a particular group of microbial eukaryotes to retrieve all sequences belonging to that group from International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) (GenBank, the European Nucleotide Archive [ENA], or the DNA DataBank of Japan [DDBJ]), to place those sequences in a phylogenetic tree, and to curate taxonomic and environmental information for the group. We provide guidelines to facilitate the process and to standardize taxonomic annotations. The final outputs of this process are (1) a reference tree and alignment, (2) a reference sequence database, including taxonomic and environmental information, and (3) a list of putative chimeras and other artifactual sequences. These products will be useful for the broad community as they become publicly available (at eukref.org) and are shared with existing reference databases. © 2018 del Campo et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

AB  - Illumina Hiseq 2500 deep sequencing was used to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in matched pairs of isograft corneas and normal corneas, allograft corneas and isograft corneas. Our results showed that 22 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 4 were significantly downregulated in the isograft group when compared with the control group (P < 0.01), while 17 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 3 were significantly downregulated in the allograft group when compared with the isograft group (P < 0.01). Among the miRNAs with altered expression levels, miR-155-5p, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, and miR-223-3p displayed simultaneous changes in the above two comparisons. Potential target genes among the DEGs were predicted using target prediction software (TargetScan, Miranda, miRDB, and CLIP), and the overlay portion was analyzed using the Gene Ontology (GO) database and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). GO and KEGG analyses showed that the DEGs were mainly involved in metabolic pathways, cytokine secretion, and tumor immunity functions. An analysis of the interactions between DEG proteins (PPI analysis) and a MetaCore software analysis of 4 key DEGs revealed that the genes regulated by miR-155-5p played important roles in the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. Furthermore, the MetaCore analysis identified C/EBP beta, p53, and sp1 as key transcription factors in that network. Our study identified transplanted corneas-specific miRNA in matched pairs of isograft corneas and normal corneas, allograft corneas and isograft corneas. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis of the key miRNA regulatory network revealed the molecular mechanisms, which suggests miRNAs may as new molecular targets for treating corneal injuries and corneal transplant rejection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Previous studies demonstrated that prognosis of germline deficiency in mismatch repair protein (dMMR) was different from that of sporadic dMMR. The underlying mechanism has not been studied. Methods: From a prospectively maintained database, we collected dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) patients identified by postoperative immunohistochemistry screening. According to genetic test, patients were grouped as Lynch-associated or sporadic dMMR.We compared the clinical-pathological features, prognosis, and immunoreactive differences between the two groups. By whole-exome sequencing and neoantigen detection pipeline, mutational frequencies and neoantigen burdens were also compared. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Sixty-seven sporadic dMMR and 85 Lynch-associated CRC patients were included in the study. Sporadic dMMR patients were older (P < .001) and their tumors were poorly differentiated (P .03). The survival was better in the Lynch-associated group (P .001). After adjustment, the difference still remained statistically significant (hazard ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.95, P .04). The scores of Crohn's-like reaction (CRO; P < .001), immunoreactions in the invasivemargin (IM; P .01), tumor stroma (TS; P .009), and cancer nest (CN; P .02) of the Lynch-associated group were statistically significantly higher. The numbers of CD3 , CD8 , Foxp3 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in IM; CD3 , CD4 TILs in TS; and CD3 , CD4 , CD8 TILs in CN were statistically significantly higher in Lynch-associated dMMR patients. Based on the 16 patients who under went whole-exome sequencing, there were alsomore somaticmutations and neoantigen burdens in the Lynch-associated group compared with the sporadic dMMR group (439/pt vs 68/pt, P .006; 628/pt vs 97/pt, P .009). Conclusions: There are heterogeneities in dMMR CRCs. Lynch-associated dMMR patients present with more somatic mutations and neoantigens compared with sporadic dMMR, which probably results in stronger immunoreactions and survival improvement. © 2018 Oxford University Press.

AB  - SF-1/NR5A1 is a transcriptional regulator of adrenal and gonadal development. NR5A1 disease-causing variants cause disorders of sex development (DSD) and adrenal failure, but most affected individuals show a broad DSD/reproductive phenotype only. Most NR5A1 variants show in vitro pathogenic effects, but not when tested in heterozygote state together with wild-type NR5A1 as usually seen in patients. Thus, the genotype−phenotype correlation for NR5A1 variants remains an unsolved question. We analyzed heterozygous 46,XY SF-1/NR5A1 patients by whole exome sequencing and used an algorithm for data analysis based on selected project-specific DSD- and SF-1-related genes. The variants detected were evaluated for their significance in literature, databases and checked in silico using webtools. We identified 19 potentially deleterious variants (one to seven per patient) in 18 genes in four 46,XY DSD subjects carrying heterozygous NR5A1 disease-causing variants. We constructed a scheme of all these hits within the landscape of currently known genes involved in male sex determination and differentiation. Our results suggest that the broad phenotype in these heterozygous NR5A1 46,XY DSD subjects may well be explained by an oligogenic mode of inheritance, in which multiple hits, individually non-deleterious, may contribute to a DSD phenotype unique to each heterozygous SF-1/NR5A1 individual. © 2018, European Society of Human Genetics.

AB  - Knowledge of immune cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment is essential for understanding mechanisms of cancer progression and immunotherapy response. We profiled 45,000 immune cells from eight breast carcinomas, as well as matched normal breast tissue, blood, and lymph nodes, using single-cell RNA-seq. We developed a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-cell data. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumor tissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypic expansions specific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000 additional T cells revealed the combinatorial impact of TCR utilization on phenotypic diversity. Our results support a model of continuous activation in T cells and do not comport with the macrophage polarization model in cancer. Our results have important implications for characterizing tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Single-cell analysis of the breast tumor immune microenvironment, coupled with computational analysis, yields an immune map of breast cancer that points to continuous T cell activation and differentiation states. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - One of the main benefits of using modern RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology is the more accurate gene expression estimations compared with previous generations of expression data, such as the microarray. However, numerous issues can result in the possibility that an RNA-Seq read can be mapped to multiple locations on the reference genome with the same alignment scores, which occurs in plant, animal, and metagenome samples. Such a read is so-called a multiple-mapping read (MMR). The impact of these MMRs is reflected in gene expression estimation and all downstream analyses, including differential gene expression, functional enrichment, etc. Current analysis pipelines lack the tools to effectively test the reliability of gene expression estimations, thus are incapable of ensuring the validity of all downstream analyses. Our investigation into 95 RNA-Seq datasets from seven plant and animal species (totaling 1,951 GB) indicates an average of roughly 22% of all reads are MMRs. Here we present a machine learning-based tool called GeneQC (Gene expression Quality Control), which can accurately estimate the reliability of each gene's expression level derived from an RNA-Seq dataset. The underlying algorithm is designed based on extracted genomic and transcriptomic features, which are then combined using elastic-net regularization and mixture model fitting to provide a clearer picture of mapping uncertainty for each gene. GeneQC allows researchers to determine reliable expression estimations and conduct further analysis on the gene expression that is of sufficient quality. This tool also enables researchers to investigate continued re-alignment methods to determine more accurate gene expression estimates for those with low reliability. Application of GeneQC reveals high level of mapping uncertainty in plant samples and limited, severe mapping uncertainty in animal samples.

AB  - Background: Alternative splicing is a ubiquitous post-transcriptional regulation mechanism in most eukaryotic genes. Aberrant splicing isoforms and abnormal isoform ratios can contribute to cancer development. Kinase genes are key regulators of multiple cellular processes. Many kinases are found to be oncogenic and have been intensively investigated in the study of cancer and drugs. RNA-Seq provides a powerful technology for genome-wide study of alternative splicing in cancer besides the conventional gene expression profiling. But this potential has not been fully demonstrated yet. Methods: We characterized the transcriptome profile of prostate cancer using RNA-Seq data from viewpoints of both differential expression and differential splicing, with an emphasis on kinase genes and their splicing variations. We built a pipeline to conduct differential expression and differential splicing analysis, followed by functional enrichment analysis. We performed kinase domain analysis to identify the functionally important candidate kinase gene in prostate cancer, and calculated the expression levels of isoforms to explore the function of isoform switching of kinase genes in prostate cancer. Results: We identified distinct gene groups from differential expression and splicing analyses, which suggested that alternative splicing adds another level to gene expression regulation. Enriched GO terms of differentially expressed and spliced kinase genes were found to play different roles in regulation of cellular metabolism. Function analysis on differentially spliced kinase genes showed that differentially spliced exons of these genes are significantly enriched in protein kinase domains. Among them, we found that gene CDK5 has isoform switching between prostate cancer and benign tissues, which may affect cancer development by changing androgen receptor (AR) phosphorylation. The observation was validated in another RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines. Conclusions: Our work characterized the expression and splicing profiles of kinase genes in prostate cancer and proposed a hypothetical model on isoform switching of CDK5 and AR phosphorylation in prostate cancer. These findings bring new understanding to the role of alternatively spliced kinases in prostate cancer and also demonstrate the use of RNA-Seq data in studying alternative splicing in cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) related applications allow for rapid explorations due to their high-throughput and relatively fast experimental capabilities, providing unprecedented progress in gene functional annotation, gene regulation analysis, and environmental factor verification. However, with increasing amounts of sequenced reads and reference model species, the selection of appropriate reference species for gene annotation has become a new challenge. Methods: We proposed a novel approach for finding the most effective reference model species through taxonomic associations and ultra-conserved orthologous (UCO) gene comparisons among species. An online system for multiple species selection (MSS) for RNA-seq differential expression analysis was developed, and comprehensive genomic annotations from 291 reference model eukaryotic species were retrieved from the RefSeq, KEGG, and UniProt databases. Results: Using the proposed MSS pipeline, gene ontology and biological pathway enrichment analysis can be efficiently achieved, especially in the case of transcriptomic analysis of non-model organisms. The results showed that the proposed method solved problems related to limitations in annotation information and provided a roughly twenty-fold reduction in computational time, resulting in more accurate results than those of traditional approaches of using a single model reference species or the large non-redundant reference database. Conclusions: Selection of appropriate reference model species helps to reduce missing annotation information, allowing for more comprehensive results than those obtained with a single model reference species. In addition, adequate model species selection reduces the computational time significantly while retaining the same order of accuracy. The proposed system indeed provides superior performance by selecting appropriate multiple species for transcriptomic analysis compared to traditional approaches. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has greatly facilitated genomic and transcriptomic studies, contributing significantly in expanding the current knowledge on genome and transcriptome. However, the continually evolving variety of sequencing platforms, protocols and analytical pipelines has led the research community to focus on cross-platform evaluation and standardization. As a NGS pioneer in China, the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) has announced its own NGS platform designated as BGISEQ-500, since 2016. The capability of this platform in large-scale DNA sequencing and small RNA analysis has been already evaluated. However, the comparative performance of BGISEQ-500 platform in transcriptome analysis remains yet to be elucidated. The Illumina series, a leading sequencing platform in China's sequencing market, would be a preferable reference to evaluate new platforms. Methods: To this end, we describe a cross-platform comparative study between BGISEQ-500 and Illumina HiSeq4000 for analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana WT (Col 0) transcriptome. The key parameters in RNA sequencing and transcriptomic data processing were assessed in biological replicate experiments, using aforesaid platforms. Results: The results from the two platforms BGISEQ-500 and Illumina HiSeq4000 shared high concordance in both inter- (correlation, 0.88-0.93) and intra-platform (correlation, 0.95-0.98) comparison for gene quantification, identification of differentially expressed genes and alternative splicing events. However, the two platforms yielded highly variable interpretation results for single nucleotide polymorphism and insertion-deletion analysis. Conclusion: The present case study provides a comprehensive reference dataset to validate the capability of BGISEQ-500 enabling it to be established as a competitive and reliable platform in plant transcriptome analysis. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is essential for the proper development of the mammalian embryo. A maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals during preimplantation bears the potential for transgenerational inheritance of disease through the epigenetic perturbation of the developing embryo. A comprehensive assembly of embryo-specific miRNAs and respective isoforms (isomiR) is lacking to date. We aimed at revealing the sex-specific miRNA expression profile of single porcine blastocysts developing in gilts orally exposed to exogenous estradiol-17[InlineMediaObject not available: see fulltext.] (E2). Therefore we analyzed the miRNA profile specifically focusing on isomiRs and potentially embryo-specific miRNAs. Results: Deep sequencing of small RNA (small RNA-seq) result in the detection of miRNA sequences mapping to known and predicted porcine miRNAs as well as novel miRNAs highly conserved in human and cattle. A set of highly abundant miRNAs and a large number of rarely expressed miRNAs were identified by using a small RNA analysis pipeline, which was integrated into a novel Galaxy workflow specifically benefits incompletely annotated species. In particular, orthologue species information increased the total number of annotated miRNAs, while mapping to other non-coding RNAs avoided falsely annotated miRNAs. Neither the low nor the high dose of E2 treatment (10 and 1000 μ E2/kg body weight daily, respectively) affected the miRNA profile in blastocysts despite the distinct differential mRNA expression and DNA methylation found in previous studies. The high number of generated sequence reads enabled a comprehensive analysis of the isomiR repertoire showing various templated and non-templated modifications. Furthermore, potentially blastocyst-specific miRNAs were identified. Conclusions: In pre-implantation embryos, numerous distinct isomiRs were discovered indicating a high complexity of miRNA expression. Neither the sex of the embryo nor a maternal E2 exposure affected the miRNA expression profile of developing porcine blastocysts. The adaptation to the continuous duration of the E2 treatment might explain the lack of an effect. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Whole transcriptome studies typically yield large amounts of data, with expression values for all genes or transcripts of the genome. The search for genes of interest in a particular study setting can thus be a daunting task, usually relying on automated computational methods. Moreover, most biological questions imply that such a search should be performed in a multivariate setting, to take into account the inter-genes relationships. Differential expression analysis commonly yields large lists of genes deemed significant, even after adjustment for multiple testing, making the subsequent study possibilities extensive. Here, we explore the use of supervised learning methods to rank large ensembles of genes defined by their expression values measured with RNA-Seq in a typical 2 classes sample set. First, we use one of the variable importance measures generated by the random forests classification algorithm as a metric to rank genes. Second, we define the EPS (extreme pseudo-samples) pipeline, making use of VAEs (Variational Autoencoders) and regressors to extract a ranking of genes while leveraging the feature space of both virtual and comparable samples. We show that, on 12 cancer RNA-Seq data sets ranging from 323 to 1,210 samples, using either a random forests-based gene selection method or the EPS pipeline outperforms differential expression analysis for 9 and 8 out of the 12 datasets respectively, in terms of identifying subsets of genes associated with survival. These results demonstrate the potential of supervised learning-based gene selection methods in RNA-Seq studies and highlight the need to use such multivariate gene selection methods alongside the widely used differential expression analysis. © 2018 Wenric and Shemirani.

AB  - Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon of differential allelic expression based on parental origin. To date, 263 imprinted genes have been identified among all investigated mammalian species. However, only 21 have been described in sheep, of which 11 are annotated in the current ovine genome. Here, we aim to i) use DNA/RNA high throughput sequencing to identify new monoallelically expressed and imprinted genes in day 135 ovine fetuses and ii) determine whether maternal diet (100%, 60%, or 140% of National Research Council Total Digestible Nutrients) influences expression of imprinted genes. We also reported strategies to solve technical challenges in the data analysis pipeline. We identified 80 monoallelically expressed, 13 new putative imprinted genes, and five known imprinted genes in sheep using the 263 genes stated above as a guide. Sanger sequencing confirmed allelic expression of seven genes, CASD1, COPG2, DIRAS3, INPP5F, PLAGL1, PPP1R9A, and SLC22A18. Among the 13 putative imprinted genes, five were localized in the known sheep imprinting domains of MEST on chromosome 4, DLK1/GTL2 on chromosome 18 and KCNQ1 on chromosome 21, and three were in a novel sheep imprinted cluster on chromosome 4, known in other species as PEG10/SGCE. The expression of DIRAS3, IGF2, PHLDA2, and SLC22A18 was altered by maternal diet, albeit without allelic expression reversal. Together, our results expanded the list of sheep imprinted genes to 34 and demonstrated that while the expression levels of four imprinted genes were changed by maternal diet, the allelic expression patterns were un-changed for all imprinted genes studied. © 2018, © 2018 The Author (s).

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is increasing in incidence and resistance to treatment worldwide. The challenges in limited therapeutic options and poor survival outcomes in BC subtypes persist because of its molecular heterogeneity and resistance to standard endocrine therapy. Recently, high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been used to identify biomarkers of disease progression and signaling pathways that could be amenable to specific therapies according to the BC subtype. However, there is no single generally accepted pipeline for the analysis of RNA-seq data in biomarker discovery due, in part, to the needs of simultaneously satisfying constraints of sensitivity and specificity. We proposed a combined approach using gene-wise normalization, UQ-pgQ2, followed by a Wald test from DESeq2. Our approach improved the analysis based on within-group comparisons in terms of the specificity when applied to publicly available RNA-seq BC datasets. In terms of identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we combined an optimized log 2 fold change cutoff with a nominal false discovery rate of 0.05 to further minimize false positives. Using this method in the analysis of two GEO BC datasets, we identified 797 DEGs uniquely expressed in triple negative BC (TNBC) and significantly associated with T cell and immune-related signaling, contributing to the immunotherapeutic efficacy in TNBC patients. In contrast, we identified 1403 DEGs uniquely expressed in estrogen positive and HER2 negative BC (ER + HER2 - BC) and significantly associated with eicosanoid, notching and FAK signaling while a common set of genes was associated with cellular growth and proliferation. Thus, our approach to control for false positives identified two distinct gene expression profiles associated with these two subtypes of BC which are distinguishable by their molecular and functional attributes. © 2018 Li et al.

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows researchers to profile the transcriptomes of thousands of cells simultaneously. Protocols that incorporate both designed and random barcodes have greatly increased the throughput of scRNA-seq, but give rise to a more complex data structure. There is a need for new tools that can handle the various barcoding strategies used by different protocols and exploit this information for quality assessment at the sample-level and provide effective visualization of these results in preparation for higher-level analyses. To this end, we developed scPipe, an R/Bioconductor package that integrates barcode demultiplexing, read alignment, UMI-aware gene-level quantification and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple protocols that include CEL-seq, MARS-seq, Chromium 10X, Drop-seq and Smart-seq. scPipe produces a count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with an HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing. scPipe performs this processing in a few simple R commands, promoting reproducible analysis of single-cell data that is compatible with the emerging suite of open-source scRNA-seq analysis tools available in R/Bioconductor and beyond. The scPipe R package is available for download from https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/scPipe. © 2018 Tian et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

AB  - Recursive splicing, a process by which a single intron is removed from pre-mRNA transcripts in multiple distinct segments, has been observed in a small subset of Drosophila melanogaster introns. However, detection of recursive splicing requires observation of splicing intermediates that are inherently unstable, making it difficult to study. Here we developed new computational approaches to identify recursively spliced introns and applied them, in combination with existing methods, to nascent RNA sequencing data from Drosophila S2 cells. These approaches identified hundreds of novel sites of recursive splicing, expanding the catalog of recursively spliced fly introns by 4-fold. A subset of recursive sites were validated by RT-PCR and sequencing. Recursive sites occur in most very long (> 40 kb) fly introns, including many genes involved in morphogenesis and development, and tend to occur near the midpoints of introns. Suggesting a possible function for recursive splicing, we observe that fly introns with recursive sites are spliced more accurately than comparably sized non-recursive introns. © 2018 Pai et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

AB  - The long noncoding RNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) has been shown to regulate multiple cancer-related cellular activities including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. In this study, we confirm that repression of NEAT1 induces DNA damage, disturbs the cell cycle, and arrests the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. By taking advantage of the prostate cancer tumor transcriptome profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas, our data-mining pipeline identified a series of transcription factors (TF) whose regulatory activities on target genes depended on the level of NEAT1. Among them was putative TF CDC5L, which bound directly to NEAT1. Silencing NEAT1 in prostate cancer cells repressed the transcriptional activity of CDC5L, and RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses further revealed a handful of potential targets of CDC5L regulated by NEAT1 expression. One target of CDC5L, ARGN, mediated the strong phenotypic consequences of NEAT1 reduction, including DNA damage, cell-cycle dysregulation, and proliferation arrest. In summary, we have established the requirement of the CDC5L–AGRN circuit for the essential oncogenic role of NEAT1 in prostate cancer cells. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - Prompt identification of causative pathogenic bacteria is imperative for the treatment of patients suffering from infectious diseases, including sepsis and pneumonia. However, current culture-based methodologies have several drawbacks including their limitation of use to culturable bacterial species. To circumvent these problems, we attempted to detect bacterial DNA in blood using next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) technology. We conducted metagenomic and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing of DNA extracted from bacteria-spiked blood using an Ion Personal Genome Machine. NGS data was analyzed using our in-house pipeline Genome Search Toolkit and database GenomeSync. The metagenomic sequencing analysis successfully detected three grampositive and three gram-negative bacteria spiked in the blood, which was associated with a significant portion of non-bacterial reads, even though human blood cells were separated by low-speed centrifugation prior to DNA extraction. Sequencing analysis of seven variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon also successfully detected all six bacteria spiked in the blood. The methodology using 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis was verified using DNA from the blood of six patients with sepsis and four healthy volunteers with potential pathogenic bacteria in the blood being identified at the species level. These findings suggest that our system will be a potential platform for practical diagnosis in the future. Copyright © 2018 Watanabe et al.

AB  - Symbionts (e.g., endoparasites and commensals) play an integral role in their host's ecology, yet in many cases their diversity is likely underestimated. Although endoparasites are traditionally characterized using morphology, sequences of conserved genes, and shotgun metagenomics, host transcriptomes constitute an underused resource to identify these organisms’ diversity. By isolating non-host transcripts from host transcriptomes, individual host tissues can now simultaneously reveal their endoparasite species richness (i.e., number of different taxa) and provide insights into parasite gene expression. These approaches can be used in host taxa whose endoparasites are mostly unknown, such as those of tropical amphibians. Here, we focus on the poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) as hosts, which are a Neotropical clade known for their bright coloration and defensive alkaloids. These toxins are an effective protection against vertebrate predators (e.g., snakes and birds), bacteria, and skin-biting ectoparasites (e.g., mosquitoes); however, little is known about their deterrence against eukaryotic endoparasites. With de novo transcriptomes of dendrobatids, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline for endoparasite identification that uses host annotated RNA-seq data and set of a priori parasite taxonomic terms, which are used to mine for specific endoparasites. We found a large community of helminths and protozoans that were mostly restricted to the digestive tract and a few systemic parasites (e.g., Trypanosoma). Contrary to our expectations, all dendrobatid frogs regardless of the presence of alkaloid defenses have endoparasites, with their highest species richness located in the frog digestive tract. Some of these organisms (e.g., roundworms) might prove to be generalists, as they were not found to be co-diversifying with their frog hosts. We propose that endoparasites may escape poison frogs’ chemical defenses by colonizing tissues with fewer alkaloids than the frog's skin, where most toxins are stored. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis is a severe fatal disorder with an average incidence of around 1:250,000. It is diagnosed soon after birth or within the 1st year of life with severe symptoms of abnormal bone remodelling. This study was aimed to identify the underlying genetic cause of the disease in a Pakistani family segregating infantile malignant osteopetrosis in autosomal recessive pattern. Whole exome sequencing of the proband was performed using the 51 Mb SureSelect V4 library kit and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing system. The reads were analysed using standard bioinformatic data analysis pipeline. The genotype of candidate variants was confirmed in the proband and his normal parents by Sanger sequencing. Two novel homozygous missense variants were found in the same codon 204 of CLCN7 NM_001287.5:c.[610A>T;612C>G] predicting p.(Ser204Trp) variant in the protein. Sanger sequencing and RFLP assay verified that both these variants were heterozygous in the unaffected parents. Moreover, these variants were not detected in the unrelated healthy Pakistani subjects (200 chromosomes), ExAC, dbSNP, or the 1000 Genomes Project data. Multiple bioinformatics tools unanimously predicted the p.(Ser204Trp) variant as deleterious. CLCN7 mutation p.(Ser204Trp) is the likely cause of the osteopetrosis disease in the Pakistani family. This study expands the restricted spectrum of CLCN7 mutations associated with infantile malignant osteopetrosis and indicates clinical significance of whole exome sequencing in the diagnosis of clinically and genetically heterogenous osteopetrosis phenotype. These data should be helpful in the improved genetic counselling, carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the affected family. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide; however, the mutational properties of HCC-associated carcinogens remain largely uncharacterized. We hypothesized that mechanisms underlying chemical-induced HCC can be characterized by evaluating the mutational spectra of these tumors. To test this hypothesis, we performed exome sequencing of B6C3F1/N HCCs that arose either spontaneously in vehicle controls (n = 3) or due to chronic exposure to gingko biloba extract (GBE; n = 4) or methyleugenol (MEG; n = 3). Most archived tumor samples are available as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, rather than fresh-frozen (FF) samples; hence, exome sequencing from paired FF and FFPE samples was compared. FF and FFPE samples showed 63% to 70% mutation concordance. Multiple known (e.g., Ctnnb1T41A, BrafV637E) and novel (e.g., Erbb4C559S, Card10A700V, and Klf11P358L) mutations in cancer-related genes were identified. The overall mutational burden was greater for MEG than for GBE or spontaneous HCC samples. To characterize the mutagenic mechanisms, we analyzed the mutational spectra in the HCCs according to their trinucleotide motifs. The MEG tumors clustered closest to Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer signatures 4 and 24, which are, respectively, associated with benzo(a)pyrene- and aflatoxin-induced HCCs in humans. These results establish a novel approach for classifying liver carcinogens and understanding the mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinogenesis. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Background: The field of small RNA is one of the most investigated research areas since they were shown to regulate transposable elements and gene expression and play essential roles in fundamental biological processes. Small RNA deep sequencing (sRNA-seq) is now routinely used for large-scale analyses of small RNA. Such high-throughput sequencing typically produces several millions reads. Results: Here we present a computational pipeline (sRNAPipe: small RNA pipeline) based on the Galaxy framework that takes as input a fastq file of small RNA-seq reads and performs successive steps of mapping to categories of genomic sequences: transposable elements, gene transcripts, microRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs. It also provides individual mapping and counting for chromosomes, transposable elements and gene transcripts, normalization, small RNA length analysis and plotting of the data along genomic coordinates to build publication-quality graphs and figures. sRNAPipe evaluates 10-nucleotide 5′-overlaps of reads on opposite strands to test ping-pong amplification for putative PIWI-interacting RNAs, providing counts of overlaps and corresponding z-scores. Conclusions: sRNAPipe is easy to use and does not require command-line or coding knowledge. This pipeline gives quick visual and quantitative results, which are usable for publications. sRNAPipe is freely available as a Galaxy tool and via GitHub. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Conventional approaches for antiparasitic drug discovery center upon discovering selective agents that adversely impact parasites with minimal host side effects. Here, we show that agents with a broad polypharmacology, often considered ‘dirtier’ drugs, can have unique efficacy if they combine deleterious effects on the parasite with beneficial actions in the host. This principle is evidenced through a screen for drugs to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic flatworm disease that impacts over 230 million people. A target-based screen of a Schistosoma serotoninergic G protein coupled receptor yielded the potent agonist, ergotamine, which disrupted worm movement. In vivo, ergotamine decreased mortality, parasite load and intestinal egg counts but also uniquely reduced organ pathology through engagement of host GPCRs that repressed hepatic stellate cell activation, inflammatory damage and fibrosis. The unique ability of ergotamine to engage both host and parasite GPCRs evidences a future strategy for anthelmintic drug design that coalesces deleterious antiparasitic activity with beneficial host effects. © Chan et al.

AB  - This metagenome approach is used to identify plant viruses with circular DNA genomes and their transcripts. Often plant DNA viruses that occur in low titers in their host or cannot be mechanically inoculated to another host are difficult to propagate to achieve a greater titer of infectious material. Infected leaves are ground in a mild buffer with optimal pH and ionic composition recommended for purifying most bacilliform Para retroviruses. Urea is used to break up inclusion bodies that trap virions and to dissolve cellular components. Differential centrifugation provides further separation of virions from plant contaminants. Then proteinase K treatment removes the capsids. Then the viral DNA is concentrated and used for next-generation sequencing (NGS). The NGS data are used to assemble contigs which are submitted to NCBI-BLASTn to identify a subset of virus sequences in the generated dataset. In a parallel pipeline, RNA is isolated from infected leaves using a standard column-based RNA extraction method. Then ribosome depletion is carried out to enrich for a subset of mRNA and virus transcripts. Assembled sequences derived from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were submitted to NCBI-BLASTn to identify a subset of virus sequences in this dataset. In our study, we identified two related full-length badnavirus genomes in the two datasets. This method is preferred to another common approach which extracts the aggregate population of small RNA sequences to reconstitute plant virus genomic sequences. This latter metagenomic pipeline recovers virus related sequences that are retro-transcribing elements inserted into the plant genome. This is coupled to biochemical or molecular assays to further discern the actively infectious agents. The approach documented in this study, recovers sequences representative of replicating viruses that likely indicate active virus infection. © 2018 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are typically expressed at low levels and are inherently highly variable. This is a fundamental challenge for differential expression (DE) analysis. In this study, the performance of 25 pipelines for testing DE in RNA-seq data is comprehensively evaluated, with a particular focus on lncRNAs and low-abundance mRNAs. Fifteen performance metrics are used to evaluate DE tools and normalization methods using simulations and analyses of six diverse RNA-seq datasets. Results: Gene expression data are simulated using non-parametric procedures in such a way that realistic levels of expression and variability are preserved in the simulated data. Throughout the assessment, results for mRNA and lncRNA were tracked separately. All the pipelines exhibit inferior performance for lncRNAs compared to mRNAs across all simulated scenarios and benchmark RNA-seq datasets. The substandard performance of DE tools for lncRNAs applies also to low-abundance mRNAs. No single tool uniformly outperformed the others. Variability, number of samples, and fraction of DE genes markedly influenced DE tool performance. Conclusions: Overall, linear modeling with empirical Bayes moderation (limma) and a non-parametric approach (SAMSeq) showed good control of the false discovery rate and reasonable sensitivity. Of note, for achieving a sensitivity of at least 50%, more than 80 samples are required when studying expression levels in realistic settings such as in clinical cancer research. About half of the methods showed a substantial excess of false discoveries, making these methods unreliable for DE analysis and jeopardizing reproducible science. The detailed results of our study can be consulted through a user-friendly web application, giving guidance on selection of the optimal DE tool ( http://statapps.ugent.be/tools/AppDGE/ ). © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - RNA-Seq technology has been gradually becoming a routine approach for characterizing the properties of transcriptome in terms of organisms, cell types and conditions and consequently a big burden has been put on the facet of data analysis, which calls for an easy-to-learn workflow to cope with the increased demands from a large number of laboratories across the world. We report a one-in-all solution called hppRNA, composed of four scenarios such as pre-mapping, core-workflow, post-mapping and sequence variation detection, written by a series of individual Perl and R scripts, counting on well-established and preinstalled software, irrespective of single-end or paired-end, unstranded or stranded sequencing method. It features six independent core-workflows comprising the state-of-the-art technology with dozens of popular cutting-edge tools such as Tophat-Cufflink-Cuffdiff, Subread-featureCounts-DESeq2, STAR-RSEM-EBSeq, Bowtie-eXpress-edgeR, kallisto-sleuth, HISAT-StringTie-Ballgown, and embeds itself in Snakemake, which is a modern pipeline management system. The core function of this pipeline is turning the raw fastq files into gene/isoform expression matrix and differentially expressed genes or isoforms as well as the identification of fusion genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms, long noncoding RNAs and circular RNAs. Last but not least, this pipeline is specifically designed for performing the systematic analysis on a huge set of samples in one go, ideally for the researchers who intend to deploy the pipeline on their local servers. The scripts as well as the user manual are freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/hpprna/.

AB  - Background: Since the proposal of Brachypodium distachyon as a model for the grasses, over 500 Bdi-miRNAs have been annotated in miRBase making Brachypodium second in number only to rice. Other monocots, such as switchgrass, are completely absent from the miRBase database. While a significant number of miRNAs have been identified which are highly conserved across plants, little research has been done with respect to the conservation of miRNA targets. Plant responses to abiotic stresses are regulated by diverse pathways many of which involve miRNAs; however, it can be difficult to identify miRNA guided gene regulation when the miRNA is not the primary regulator of the target mRNA. Results: To investigate miRNA target conservation and stress response involvement, a set of PARE (Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends) libraries totaling over two billion reads was constructed and sequenced from Brachypodium, switchgrass, and sorghum representing the first report of RNA degradome data from the latter two species. Analysis of this data provided not only PARE evidence for miRNA guided cleavage of over 7000 predicted target mRNAs in Brachypodium, but also evidence for miRNA guided cleavage of over 1000 homologous transcripts in sorghum and switchgrass. A pipeline was constructed to compare RNA-seq and PARE data made from Brachypodium plants exposed to various abiotic stress conditions. This resulted in the identification of 44 miRNA targets which exhibit stress regulated cleavage. Time course experiments were performed to reveal the relationship between miR393ab, miR169a, miR394ab, and their respective targets throughout the first 36 h of the cold stress response in Brachypodium. Conclusions: Knowledge gained from this study provides considerable insight into the RNA degradomes and the breadth of miRNA target conservation among these three species. Additionally, associations of a number of miRNAs and target mRNAs with the stress responses have been revealed which could aid in the development of stress tolerant transgenic crops. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Interest in single-cell transcriptomic analysis is growing rapidly, especially for profiling rare or heterogeneous populations of cells. In almost all reported works investigators have used live cells, which introduces cell stress during preparation and hinders complex study designs. Recent studies have indicated that cells fixed by denaturing fixative can be used in single-cell sequencing, however they did not usually work with most types of primary cells including immune cells. Methods: The methanol-fixation and new processing method was introduced to preserve human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis on 10× Chromium platform. Results: When methanol fixation protocol was broken up into three steps: fixation, storage and rehydration, we found that PBMC RNA was degraded during rehydration with PBS, not at cell fixation and up to 3-month storage steps. Resuspension but not rehydration in 3× saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer instead of PBS preserved PBMC RNA integrity and prevented RNA leakage. Diluted SSC buffer did not interfere with full-length cDNA synthesis. The methanol-fixed PBMCs resuspended in 3× SSC were successfully implemented into 10× Chromium standard scRNA-seq workflows with no elevated low quality cells and cell doublets. The fixation process did not alter the single-cell transcriptional profiles and gene expression levels. Major subpopulations classified by marker genes could be identified in fixed PBMCs at a similar proportion as in live PBMCs. This new fixation processing protocol also worked in several other fixed primary cell types and cell lines as in live ones. Conclusions: We expect that the methanol-based cell fixation procedure presented here will allow better and more effective batching schemes for a complex single cell experimental design with primary cells or tissues. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Alternative polyadenylation (APA) results in messenger RNA molecules with different 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), affecting the molecules' stability, localization, and translation. APA is pervasive and implicated in cancer. Earlier reports on APA focused on 3' UTR length modifications and commonly characterized APA events as 3' UTR shortening or lengthening. However, such characterization oversimplifies the processing of 3' ends of transcripts and fails to adequately describe the various scenarios we observe. Results: We built a cloud-based targeted de novo transcript assembly and analysis pipeline that incorporates our previously developed cleavage site prediction tool, KLEAT. We applied this pipeline to elucidate the APA profiles of 114 genes in 9939 tumor and 729 tissue normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The full set of 10,668 RNA-Seq samples from 33 cancer types has not been utilized by previous APA studies. By comparing the frequencies of predicted cleavage sites between normal and tumor sample groups, we identified 77 events (i.e. gene-cancer type pairs) of tumor-specific APA regulation in 13 cancer types; for 15 genes, such regulation is recurrent across multiple cancers. Our results also support a previous report showing the 3' UTR shortening of FGF2 in multiple cancers. However, over half of the events we identified display complex changes to 3' UTR length that resist simple classification like shortening or lengthening. Conclusions: Recurrent tumor-specific regulation of APA is widespread in cancer. However, the regulation pattern that we observed in TCGA RNA-seq data cannot be described as straightforward 3' UTR shortening or lengthening. Continued investigation into this complex, nuanced regulatory landscape will provide further insight into its role in tumor formation and development. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: An open challenge in translational bioinformatics is the analysis of sequenced metagenomes from various environmental samples. Of course, several studies demonstrated the 16S ribosomal RNA could be considered as a barcode for bacteria classification at the genus level, but till now it is hard to identify the correct composition of metagenomic data from RNA-seq short-read data. 16S short-read data are generated using two next generation sequencing technologies, i.e. whole genome shotgun (WGS) and amplicon (AMP); typically, the former is filtered to obtain short-reads belonging to a 16S shotgun (SG), whereas the latter take into account only some specific 16S hypervariable regions. The above mentioned two sequencing technologies, SG and AMP, are used alternatively, for this reason in this work we propose a deep learning approach for taxonomic classification of metagenomic data, that can be employed for both of them. Results: To test the proposed pipeline, we simulated both SG and AMP short-reads, from 1000 16S full-length sequences. Then, we adopted a k-mer representation to map sequences as vectors into a numerical space. Finally, we trained two different deep learning architecture, i.e., convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep belief network (DBN), obtaining a trained model for each taxon. We tested our proposed methodology to find the best parameters configuration, and we compared our results against the classification performances provided by a reference classifier for bacteria identification, known as RDP classifier. We outperformed the RDP classifier at each taxonomic level with both architectures. For instance, at the genus level, both CNN and DBN reached 91.3% of accuracy with AMP short-reads, whereas RDP classifier obtained 83.8% with the same data. Conclusions: In this work, we proposed a 16S short-read sequences classification technique based on k-mer representation and deep learning architecture, in which each taxon (from phylum to genus) generates a classification model. Experimental results confirm the proposed pipeline as a valid approach for classifying bacteria sequences; for this reason, our approach could be integrated into the most common tools for metagenomic analysis. According to obtained results, it can be successfully used for classifying both SG and AMP data. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) can vary through the use of alternative polyadenylation sites during pre-mRNA processing. Multiple publically available pipelines combining high profiling technologies and bioinformatics tools have been developed to catalog changes in 3′-UTR lengths. In our recent RNA-seq experiments using cells with hyper-activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), we found that cellular mTOR activation leads to transcriptome-wide alternative polyadenylation (APA), resulting in the activation of multiple cellular pathways. Here, we developed a novel bioinformatics algorithm, IntMAP, which integrates RNA-Seq and PolyA Site (PAS)-Seq data for a comprehensive characterization of APA events. By applying IntMAP to the datasets from cells with hyper-activated mTOR, we identified novel APA events that could otherwise not be identified by either profiling method alone. Several transcription factors including Cebpg (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein gamma) were among the newly discovered APA transcripts, indicating that diverse transcriptional networks may be regulated by mTOR-coordinated APA. The prevention of APA in Cebpg using the CRISPR/cas9-mediated genome editing tool showed that mTOR-driven 3′-UTR shortening in Cebpg is critical in protecting cells from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Taken together, we present IntMAP as a new bioinformatics algorithm for APA analysis by which we expand our understanding of the physiological role of mTOR-coordinated APA events to ER stress response.

AB  - Integration of detailed phenotype information with genetic data is well established to facilitate accurate diagnosis of hereditary disorders. As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records (EHRs) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous EHR narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present EHR-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput EHR framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. EHR-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from EHR narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the HPO-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed EHR-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by EHR-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p &lt; 2.2 × 10 −16 ), supporting the value of phenotype-driven gene prioritization in diagnostic sequence interpretation. To assess the generalizability, we replicated this finding on an independent EHR dataset of ten individuals with a positive diagnosis from a different institution. We then assessed the broader utility by examining two additional EHR datasets, including 31 individuals who were suspected of having a Mendelian disease and underwent different types of genetic testing and 20 individuals with positive diagnoses of specific Mendelian etiologies of chronic kidney disease from exome sequencing. Finally, through several retrospective case studies, we demonstrated how combined analyses of genotype data and deep phenotype data from EHRs can expedite genetic diagnoses. In summary, EHR-Phenolyzer leverages EHR narratives to automate phenotype-driven analysis of clinical exomes or genomes, facilitating the broader implementation of genomic medicine. © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics

AB  - Background: Alignment-free RNA quantification tools have significantly increased the speed of RNA-seq analysis. However, it is unclear whether these state-of-the-art RNA-seq analysis pipelines can quantify small RNAs as accurately as they do with long RNAs in the context of total RNA quantification. Result: We comprehensively tested and compared four RNA-seq pipelines for accuracy of gene quantification and fold-change estimation. We used a novel total RNA benchmarking dataset in which small non-coding RNAs are highly represented along with other long RNAs. The four RNA-seq pipelines consisted of two commonly-used alignment-free pipelines and two variants of alignment-based pipelines. We found that all pipelines showed high accuracy for quantifying the expression of long and highly-abundant genes. However, alignment-free pipelines showed systematically poorer performance in quantifying lowly-abundant and small RNAs. Conclusion: We have shown that alignment-free and traditional alignment-based quantification methods perform similarly for common gene targets, such as protein-coding genes. However, we have identified a potential pitfall in analyzing and quantifying lowly-expressed genes and small RNAs with alignment-free pipelines, especially when these small RNAs contain biological variations. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The recent accumulation of gene expression data in the form of RNA sequencing creates unprecedented opportunities to study gene regulation and function. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the expression data from multiple species can elucidate which functional gene modules are conserved across species, allowing the study of the evolution of these modules. However, performing such comparative analyses on raw data is not feasible for many biologists. Here, we present CoNekT (Co-expression Network Toolkit), an open source web server, that contains user-friendly tools and interactive visualizations for comparative analyses of gene expression data and co-expression networks. These tools allow analysis and cross-species comparison of (i) gene expression profiles; (ii) co-expression networks; (iii) co-expressed clusters involved in specific biological processes; (iv) tissue-specific gene expression; and (v) expression profiles of gene families. To demonstrate these features, we constructed CoNekT-Plants for green alga, seed plants and flowering plants (Picea abies, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Vitis vinifera, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Zea mays and Solanum lycopersicum) and thus provide a web-tool with the broadest available collection of plant phyla.

AB  - Plant regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs), which include most microRNAs (miRNAs) and a subset of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), such as the phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs), play important roles in regulating gene expression. Although generated from genetically distinct biogenesis pathways, these regulatory sRNAs share the same mechanisms for posttranslational gene silencing and translational inhibition. psRNATarget was developed to identify plant sRNA targets by (i) analyzing complementary matching between the sRNA sequence and target mRNA sequence using a predefined scoring schema and (ii) by evaluating target site accessibility. This update enhances its analytical performance by developing a new scoring schema that is capable of discovering miRNA-mRNA interactions at higher 'recall rates' without significantly increasing total prediction output. The scoring procedure is customizable for the users to search both canonical and noncanonical targets. This update also enables transmitting and analyzing 'big' data empowered by (a) the implementation of multi-threading chunked file uploading, which can be paused and resumed, using HTML5 APIs and (b) the allocation of significantly more computing nodes to its back-end Linux cluster. The updated psRNATarget server has clear, compelling and user-friendly interfaces that enhance user experiences and present data clearly and concisely. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Beneficial plant-associated bacteria play an important role in promoting growth and preventing disease in plants. The application of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) as biofertilizers or biocontrol agents has become an effective alternative to the use of conventional fertilizers and can increase crop productivity at low cost. Plant-microbe interactions depend upon host plant-secreted signals and a reaction hereon by their associated bacteria. However, the molecular mechanisms of how beneficial bacteria respond to their associated plant-derived signals are not fully understood. Assessing the transcriptomic response of bacteria to root exudates is a powerful approach to determine the bacterial gene expression and regulation under rhizospheric conditions. Such knowledge is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in plant-microbe interactions. This paper describes a detailed protocol to study the transcriptomic response of B. mycoides EC18, a strain isolated from the potato endosphere, to potato root exudates. With the help of recent high-throughput sequencing technology, this protocol can be performed in several weeks and produce massive datasets. First, we collect the root exudates under sterile conditions, after which they are added to B. mycoides cultures. The RNA from these cultures is isolated using a phenol/chloroform method combined with a commercial kit and subjected to quality control by an automated electrophoresis instrument. After sequencing, data analysis is performed with the web-based TREx pipeline and a group of differentially expressed genes is identified. This method is a useful tool to facilitate new discoveries on the bacterial genes involved in plant-microbe interactions. © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

AB  - We assessed the performance characteristics of an RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) assay designed to detect gene fusions in 571 genes to help manage patients with cancer. Polyadenylated RNA was converted to cDNA, which was then used to prepare next-generation sequencing libraries that were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument and analyzed with an in-house developed bioinformatic pipeline. The assay identified 38 of 41 gene fusions detected by another method, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization or RT-PCR, for a sensitivity of 93%. No false-positive gene fusions were identified in 15 normal tissue specimens and 10 tumor specimens that were negative for fusions by RNA sequencing or Mate Pair NGS (100% specificity). The assay also identified 22 fusions in 17 tumor specimens that had not been detected by other methods. Eighteen of the 22 fusions had not previously been described. Good intra-assay and interassay reproducibility was observed with complete concordance for the presence or absence of gene fusions in replicates. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was tested by diluting RNA isolated from gene fusion–positive cases with fusion-negative RNA. Gene fusions were generally detectable down to 12.5% dilutions for most fusions and as little as 3% for some fusions. This assay can help identify fusions in patients with cancer; these patients may in turn benefit from both US Food and Drug Administration–approved and investigational targeted therapies. © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology

AB  - Nowadays, the analysis of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data has become the standard method for quantifying the levels of gene expression. In RNA-seq experiments, the mapping of short reads to a reference genome or transcriptome is considered a crucial step that remains as one of the most time-consuming. With the steady development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, unprecedented amounts of genomic data introduce significant challenges in terms of storage, processing and downstream analysis. As cost and throughput continue to improve, there is a growing need for new software solutions that minimize the impact of increasing data volume on RNA read alignment. In this work we introduce HSRA, a Big Data tool that takes advantage of the MapReduce programming model to extend the multithreading capabilities of a state-of-the-art spliced read aligner for RNA-seq data (HISAT2) to distributed memory systems such as multi-core clusters or cloud platforms. HSRA has been built upon the Hadoop MapReduce framework and supports both single- and paired-end reads from FASTQ/FASTA datasets, providing output alignments in SAM format. The design of HSRA has been carefully optimized to avoid the main limitations and major causes of inefficiency found in previous Big Data mapping tools, which cannot fully exploit the raw performance of the underlying aligner. On a 16-node multi-core cluster, HSRA is on average 2.3 times faster than previous Hadoop-based tools.

AB  - Modern techniques of next-generation sequencing (NGS) allow obtaining expression profile of all genes and provide an essential basis for characterizing metabolism in the organism of interest on a broad scale. An important condition for obtaining a demonstrative physiological picture using high throughput sequencing data is the availability of the genome sequence and its sufficient annotation for the target organism. However, a list of species with properly annotated genomes is limited. Transcriptome profiling is often performed in the so-called non-model organisms, which are those with unknown or poorly assembled and/or annotated genome sequences. The transcriptomes of non-model organisms are possible to investigate using algorithms of de novo assembly of the transcripts from sequences obtained as the result of RNA sequencing. A physiological interpretation of the data is difficult in this case because of the absence of annotation of the assembled transcripts and their classification by metabolic pathway and functional category. An algorithm for transcriptome profiling in non-model organisms was developed, and a transcriptome analysis was performed for the basidiomycete Lentinus edodes. The algorithm includes open access software and custom scripts and encompasses a complete analysis pipeline from the selection of cDNA reads to the functional classification of differentially expressed genes and the visualization of the results. Based on this algorithm, a comparative transcriptome analysis of the nonpigmented mycelium and brown mycelial mat was performed in L. edodes. The comparison revealed physiological differences between the two morphogenetic stages, including an induction of cell wall biogenesis, intercellular communication, ion transport, and melanization in the brown mycelial mat. © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - This contribution sketches a work flow to design an RNA switch that is able to adapt two structural conformations in a ligand-dependent way. A well characterized RNA aptamer, i.e., knowing its K d and adaptive structural features, is an essential ingredient of the described design process. We exemplify the principles using the well-known theophylline aptamer throughout this work. The aptamer in its ligand-binding competent structure represents one structural conformation of the switch while an alternative fold that disrupts the binding-competent structure forms the other conformation. To keep it simple we do not incorporate any regulatory mechanism to control transcription or translation. We elucidate a commonly used design process by explicitly dissecting and explaining the necessary steps in detail. We developed a novel objective function which specifies the mechanistics of this simple, ligand-triggered riboswitch and describe an extensive in silico analysis pipeline to evaluate important kinetic properties of the designed sequences. This protocol and the developed software can be easily extended or adapted to fit novel design scenarios and thus can serve as a template for future needs. © 2018

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have various functions, including chromatin remodeling and the regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. However, few lncRNAs have been investigated comprehensively, with the majority being uncharacterized. In the present study, a bioinformatics pipeline was established to identify novel lncRNA sequences similar to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of protein-coding genes. These pairs of lncRNAs and coding genes contained the same microRNA (miRNA) target sites; the lncRNA CR933609 matched the 3′-UTR of INO80 complex subunit D (INO80D) mRNA. The expression levels of CR933609 and INO80D were significantly decreased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancer tissues. The expression levels of CR933609 and INO80D were decreased in CR933609-knockdown NSCLC cells, but only expression levels of INO80D decreased in INO80D knockdown cells. It was shown that there are independent promoters in CR933609 and INO80D. It was also found that the expression levels of INO80D were downregulated by endogenous miRNA-5096 in A549 cells, but not in CR933609-overexpressing A549 cells. Furthermore, the lncRNA CR933609 acted as a decoy to protect INO80D from downregulation by miRNA-5096 in NSCLC cells. A protocol was established to identify novel lncRNAs in the 3′-UTR and the existence of novel lncRNAs was confirmed. © 2018 Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Genetic risk factors, intestinal microbiota and a dysregulated immune system contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We have previously demonstrated that dysfunction of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) and PTPN22 contributes to alterations of intestinal microbiota and the onset of chronic intestinal inflammation in vivo. Here, we investigated the influence of PTPN2 and PTPN22 gene variants on intestinal microbiota composition in IBD patients. Methods Bacterial DNA from mucosa-associated samples of 75 CD and 57 UC patients were sequenced using 16S rRNA sequencing approach. Microbial analysis, including alpha diversity, beta diversity and taxonomical analysis by comparing to PTPN2 (rs1893217) and PTPN22 (rs2476601) genotypes was performed in QIIME, the phyloseq R package and MaAsLin pipeline. Results In PTPN2 variant UC patients, we detected an increase in relative abundance of unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Lachnospiraceae families and reduction of Roseburia when compared to PTPN2 wild-type (WT) patients. Ruminoccocus was increased in PTPN22 variant UC patients. In CD patients with severe disease course, Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, unclassified Erysipelotrichaeceae, unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae families were reduced and Bacteroides were increased in PTPN2 WT carriers, while Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, and Erysipelotrichaeceae were reduced in PTPN22 WT patients when compared to patients with mild disease. In UC patients with severe disease, relative abundance of Lachnobacterium was reduced in PTPN2 and PTPN22 WT patients, Dorea was increased in samples from PTPN22 WT carriers and an unassigned genus from Ruminococcaceae gen. was increased in patients with PTPN2 variant genotype. Conclusions We identified that IBD-associated genetic risk variants, disease severity and the interaction of these factors are related to significant alterations in intestinal microbiota composition of IBD patients. © 2018 Yilmaz et al.

AB  - Bats are highly diverse and ecologically valuable mammals. They serve as host to bacteria, viruses and fungi that are either beneficial or harmful to its colony as well as to other groups of cave organisms. The bacterial diversity of two bat guano samples, C1 and C2, from Cabalyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan, Philippines were investigated using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. V3-V4 hypervariable regions were amplified and then sequenced using Illumina MiSeq 250 PE system. Reads were processed using Mothur and QIIME pipelines and assigned 12,345 OTUs for C1 and 5,408 OTUs for C2. The most dominant OTUs in C1 belong to the Proteobacteria (61.7%), Actinobacteria (19.4%), Bacteroidetes (4.2%), Firmicutes (2.7%), Chloroflexi (2.5%), candidate phylum TM7 (2.3%) and Planctomycetes (1.9%) while Proteobacteria (61.7%) and Actinobacteria (34.9%) dominated C2. Large proportion of sequence reads mainly associated with unclassified bacteria indicated possible occurrence of novel bacteria in both samples. XRF spectrophotometric analyses of C1 and C2 guano revealed significant differences in the composition of both major and trace elements. C1 guano recorded high levels of Si, Fe, Mg, Al, Mn, Ti and Cu while C2 samples registered high concentrations of Ca, P, S, Zn and Cr. Community structure of the samples were compared with other published community profiling studies from Finland (SRR868695), Meghalaya, Northeast India (SRR1793374) and Maharashtra State, India (CGS). Core microbiome among samples were determined for comparison. Variations were observed among previously studied guano samples and the Cabalyorisa Cave samples were attributed to either bat sources or age of the guano. This is the first study on bacterial diversity of guano in the Philippines through high-throughput sequencing. © 2018 P. De Leon et al.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was the clinical and molecular characterization of a family segregating a trait consisting of a phenotype specifically involving the maxillary canines, including agenesis, impaction and ectopic eruption, characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Design: Clinical standardized assessment of 14 family members and a whole-exome sequencing (WES) of three affected subjects were performed. WES data analyses (sequence alignment, variant calling, annotation and prioritization) were carried out using an in-house implemented pipeline. Variant filtering retained coding and splice-site high quality private and rare variants. Variant prioritization was performed taking into account both the disruptive impact and the biological relevance of individual variants and genes. Sanger sequencing was performed to validate the variants of interest and to carry out segregation analysis. Results: Prioritization of variants “by function” allowed the identification of multiple variants contributing to the trait, including two concomitant heterozygous variants in EDARADD (c.308C>T, p.Ser103Phe) and COL5A1 (c.1588G>A, p.Gly530Ser), specifically associated with a more severe phenotype (i.e. canine agenesis). Differently, heterozygous variants in genes encoding proteins with a role in the WNT pathway were shared by subjects showing a phenotype of impacted/ectopic erupted canines. Conclusions: This study characterized the genetic contribution underlying a complex trait consisting of isolated canine anomalies in a medium-sized family, highlighting the role of WNT and EDA cell signaling pathways in tooth development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Interpretation of next-generation sequencing constitutes the main limitation of molecular diagnostics. In diagnosing myopathies and muscular dystrophies, another issue is efficiency in predicting the pathogenicity of variants identified in large genes, especially TTN; current in silico prediction tools show limitations in predicting and ranking the numerous variants of such genes. We propose a variant-prioritization tool, the MoBiDiC prioritization algorithm (MPA). MPA is based on curated interpretation of data on previously reported variants, biological assumptions, and splice and missense predictors, and is used to prioritize all types of single-nucleotide variants. MPA was validated by comparing its sensitivity and specificity to those of dbNSFP database prediction tools, using a data set composed of DYSF, DMD, LMNA, NEB, and TTN variants extracted from expert-reviewed and ExAC databases. MPA obtained the best annotation rates for missense and splice variants. As MPA aggregates the results from several predictors, individual predictor errors are counterweighted, improving the sensitivity and specificity of missense and splice variant predictions. We propose a sequential use of MPA, beginning with the selection of variants with higher scores and followed by, in the absence of candidate pathologic variants, consideration of variants with lower scores. We provide scripts and documentation for free academic use and a validated annotation pipeline scaled for panel and exome sequencing to prioritize single-nucleotide variants from a VCF file. © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology

AB  - Recent single-cell RNA-seq protocols based on droplet microfluidics use massively multiplexed barcoding to enable simultaneous measurements of transcriptomes for thousands of individual cells. The increasing complexity of such data creates challenges for subsequent computational processing and troubleshooting of these experiments, with few software options currently available. Here, we describe a flexible pipeline for processing droplet-based transcriptome data that implements barcode corrections, classification of cell quality, and diagnostic information about the droplet libraries. We introduce advanced methods for correcting composition bias and sequencing errors affecting cellular and molecular barcodes to provide more accurate estimates of molecular counts in individual cells. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus of swine. PRV has a large double-stranded DNA genome and, as the latest investigations have revealed, a very complex transcriptome. Here, we present a large RNA-Seq dataset, derived from both short-A nd long-read sequencing. The dataset contains 1.3 million 100 bp paired-end reads that were obtained from the Illumina random-primed libraries, as well as 10 million 50 bp single-end reads generated by the Illumina polyA-seq. The Pacific Biosciences RSII non-amplified method yielded 57,021 reads of inserts (ROIs) aligned to the viral genome, the amplified method resulted in 158,396 PRV-specific ROIs, while we obtained 12,555 ROIs using the Sequel platform. The Oxford Nanopore's MinION device generated 44,006 reads using their regular cDNA-sequencing method, whereas 29,832 and 120,394 reads were produced by using the direct RNA-sequencing and the Cap-selection protocols, respectively. The raw reads were aligned to the PRV reference genome (KJ717942.1). Our provided dataset can be used to compare different sequencing approaches, library preparation methods, as well as for validation and testing bioinformatic pipelines. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Allele-specific transcriptional regulation, including of imprinted genes, is essential for normal mammalian development. While the regulatory regions controlling imprinted genes are associated with DNA methylation (DNAme) and specific histone modifications, the interplay between transcription and these epigenetic marks at allelic resolution is typically not investigated genome-wide due to a lack of bioinformatic packages that can process and integrate multiple epigenomic datasets with allelic resolution. In addition, existing ad-hoc software only consider SNVs for allele-specific read discovery. This limitation omits potentially informative INDELs, which constitute about one fifth of the number of SNVs in mice, and introduces a systematic reference bias in allele-specific analyses. Results: Here, we describe MEA, an INDEL-aware Methylomic and Epigenomic Allele-specific analysis pipeline which enables user-friendly data exploration, visualization and interpretation of allelic imbalance. Applying MEA to mouse embryonic datasets yields robust allele-specific DNAme maps and low reference bias. We validate allele-specific DNAme at known differentially methylated regions and show that automated integration of such methylation data with RNA- and ChIP-seq datasets yields an intuitive, multidimensional view of allelic gene regulation. MEA uncovers numerous novel dynamically methylated loci, highlighting the sensitivity of our pipeline. Furthermore, processing and visualization of epigenomic datasets from human brain reveals the expected allele-specific enrichment of H3K27ac and DNAme at imprinted as well as novel monoallelically expressed genes, highlighting MEA's utility for integrating human datasets of distinct provenance for genome-wide analysis of allelic phenomena. Conclusions: Our novel pipeline for standardized allele-specific processing and visualization of disparate epigenomic and methylomic datasets enables rapid analysis and navigation with allelic resolution.

AB  - The dynamic process involving the selection and maturation of follicles is regulated and controlled by a highly synchronized and exquisitely timed cascade of gene expression. Studies have shown that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is essential for the normal maintenance of animal reproductive function and has an important regulatory function in ovarian development and hormone secretion. In this study, a total of 2076 lncRNAs (1362 known lncRNAs and 714 new lncRNAs) and 25,491 mRNAs were identified in libraries constructed from Duroc ovaries on days 0, 2 and 4 of follicle development. lncRNAs were shorter, had fewer exons, exhibited a shorter ORF (Open Reading Frame) length and lower expression levels, and were less conserved than mRNAs. Furthermore, 1694 transcripts (140 lncRNAs and 1554 mRNAs) were found to be differentially expressed in pairwise comparisons. A total of 6945 co-localized mRNAs were detected in cis in 2076 lncRNAs. The most enriched GO (Gene Ontology) terms were related to developmental processes. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed lncRNAs targeted mRNAs, and the differentially expressed mRNAs were related to the TGF-β signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the Retinol metabolic pathway and the Wnt signaling pathway. This study deepened our understanding of the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of follicular development in pigs. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Late blight caused by the oomycete fungus Phytophthora infestans (Pi) is the most serious obstacle to potato (Solanum tuberosum) production in the world. A super race isolate, CN152, which was identified from Sichuan Province, China, could overcome nearly all known late blight resistance genes and caused serious damage in China. The potato genotype SD20 was verified to be highly resistant to CN152; however, the molecular regulation network underlying late blight resistance pathway remains unclear in SD20. Here, we performed a time-course experiment to systematically profile the late blight resistance response genes using RNA-sequencing in SD20. We identified 3354 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which mainly encoded transcription factors and protein kinases, and also included four NBS-LRR genes. The late blight responsive genes showed time-point-specific induction/repression. Multi-signaling pathways of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene signaling pathways involved in resistance and defense against Pi in SD20. Gene Ontology and KEGG analyses indicated that the DEGs were significantly enriched in metabolic process, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Forty-three DEGs were involved in immune response, of which 19 were enriched in hypersensitive response reaction, which could play an important role in broad-spectrum resistance to Pi infection. Experimental verification confirmed the induced expression of the responsive genes in the late blight resistance signaling pathway, such as WRKY, ERF, MAPK, and NBS-LRR family genes. Our results provided valuable information for understanding late blight resistance mechanism of potato. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Analysis of de novo mutations (DNMs) from sequencing data of nuclear families has identified risk genes for many complex diseases, including multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Most of these efforts have focused on mutations in protein-coding sequences. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) strongly suggests that variants important to human diseases often lie in non-coding regions. Extending DNM-based approaches to non-coding sequences is challenging, however, because the functional significance of non-coding mutations is difficult to predict. We propose a statistical framework for analyzing DNMs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This method, TADA-Annotations (TADA-A), is a major advance of the TADA method we developed earlier for DNM analysis in coding regions. TADA-A is able to incorporate many functional annotations such as conservation and enhancer marks, to learn from data which annotations are informative of pathogenic mutations, and to combine both coding and non-coding mutations at the gene level to detect risk genes. It also supports meta-analysis of multiple DNM studies, while adjusting for study-specific technical effects. We applied TADA-A to WGS data of ∼300 autism-affected family trios across five studies and discovered several autism risk genes.

AB  - Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential metabolic cofactor used by around 4% of cellular enzymes. Its role is to carry and transfer acetyl and acyl groups to other molecules. Cells can synthesize CoA de novo from vitamin B5 (pantothenate) through five consecutive enzymatic steps. Phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPCS) catalyzes the second step of the pathway during which phosphopantothenate reacts with ATP and cysteine to form phosphopantothenoylcysteine. Inborn errors of CoA biosynthesis have been implicated in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), a group of rare neurological disorders characterized by accumulation of iron in the basal ganglia and progressive neurodegeneration. Exome sequencing in five individuals from two unrelated families presenting with dilated cardiomyopathy revealed biallelic mutations in PPCS, linking CoA synthesis with a cardiac phenotype. Studies in yeast and fruit flies confirmed the pathogenicity of identified mutations. Biochemical analysis revealed a decrease in CoA levels in fibroblasts of all affected individuals. CoA biosynthesis can occur with pantethine as a source independent from PPCS, suggesting pantethine as targeted treatment for the affected individuals still alive. © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics

AB  - Background: Feed intake and body weight gain are economically important inputs and outputs of beef production systems. The purpose of this study was to discover differentially expressed genes that will be robust for feed intake and gain across a large segment of the cattle industry. Transcriptomic studies often suffer from issues with reproducibility and cross-validation. One way to improve reproducibility is by integrating multiple datasets via meta-analysis. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on longissimus dorsi muscle from 80 steers (5 cohorts, each with 16 animals) selected from the outside fringe of a bivariate gain and feed intake distribution to understand the genes and pathways involved in feed efficiency. In each cohort, 16 steers were selected from one of four gain and feed intake phenotypes (n = 4 per phenotype) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with gain and feed intake as main effect variables. Each cohort was analyzed as a single experiment using a generalized linear model and results from the 5 cohort analyses were combined in a meta-analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) across the cohorts. Results: A total of 51 genes were differentially expressed for the main effect of gain, 109 genes for the intake main effect, and 11 genes for the gain x intake interaction (Pcorrected &lt; 0.05). A jackknife sensitivity analysis showed that, in general, the meta-analysis produced robust DEGs for the two main effects and their interaction. Pathways identified from over-represented genes included mitochondrial energy production and oxidative stress pathways for the main effect of gain due to DEG including GPD1, NDUFA6, UQCRQ, ACTC1, and MGST3. For intake, metabolic pathways including amino acid biosynthesis and degradation were identified, and for the interaction analysis the pathways identified included GADD45, pyridoxal 5'phosphate salvage, and caveolar mediated endocytosis signaling. Conclusions: Variation among DEG identified by cohort suggests that environment and breed may play large roles in the expression of genes associated with feed efficiency in the muscle of beef cattle. Meta-analyses of transcriptome data from groups of animals over multiple cohorts may be necessary to elucidate the genetics contributing these types of biological phenotypes. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have malfunctioning roles in oncogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the role of box C/D small nucleolar RNA U2_19 (snoU2_19) in the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, we screened snoRNAs differential signatures by performing high-throughput small RNA sequence in HCC tissues and validated that upregulated snoU2_19 was associated with aggressive phenotypes in HCC patients. Aberrant snoU2_19 facilitated HCC cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis and induced cell cycle progression in vitro analyses. We globally investigated the molecular mechanisms of snoU2_19 in HCC and found that snoU2_19 knockdown inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through inducing the translocation of β-catenin in cytoplasm. We concluded that snoU2_19 plays a pathological role in the development and progression of HCC, and is a potential therapeutic target for HCC. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become the preferred method for global quantification of bacterial gene expression. With the continued improvements in sequencing technology and data analysis tools, the most labor-intensive and expensive part of an RNA-seq experiment is the preparation of sequencing libraries, which is also essential for the quality of the data obtained. Here, we present a straightforward and inexpensive basic protocol for preparation of strand-specific RNA-seq libraries from bacterial RNA as well as a computational pipeline for the data analysis of sequencing reads. The protocol is based on the Illumina platform and allows easy multiplexing of samples and the removal of sequencing reads that are PCR duplicates. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Obesity is known to induce pathological changes in the gut and diets rich in complex carbohydrates that resist digestion in the small bowel can alter large bowel ecology. The purposes of this study were to identify the effects of bitter melon powder (BMP) on the global gene expression pattern in the colon mucosa of obese rats. Obese rats were fed a high-fat diet and treated without or with BMP for 8 weeks. Genome-wide expression profiles of the colon mucosa were determined by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis at the end of experiment. A total of 87 genes were identified as differentially expressed (DE) between these two groups (fold change > 1.2). These results were further validated by quantitative RT-PCR, confirming the high reliability of the RNA-Seq. Interestingly, DE genes implicated in inflammation and lipid metabolism were found to be downregulated by BMP in the colon. Network between genes and the top 15 KEGG pathways showed that PRKCβ (protein kinase C beta) and Pla2g2a (phospholipase A2 group IIA) strongly interacted with surrounding pathways and genes. Results revealed that BMP supplement could remodel key colon functions by altering transcriptomic profile in obese rats. © 2018, The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The molecular mechanisms underlying aggressive versus indolent disease are not fully understood. Recent research has implicated a class of molecules known as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumorigenesis and progression of cancer. Our objective was to discover lncRNAs that differentiate aggressive and indolent prostate cancers. METHODS: We analyzed paired tumor and normal tissues from six aggressive Gleason score (GS) 8-10 and six indolent GS 6 prostate cancers. Extracted RNA was split for poly(A)+ and ribosomal RNA depletion library preparations, followed byRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) using an Illumina HiSeq 2000. We developed an RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline to discover and quantify these molecules. Candidate lncRNAs were validated using RT-qPCR on 87 tumor tissue samples: 28 (GS 6), 28 (GS 3+4), 6 (GS 4+3), and 25 (GS 8-10). Statistical correlations between lncRNAs and clinicopathologic variables were tested using ANOVA. RESULTS: The 43 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs between aggressive and indolent prostate cancers included 12 annotated and 31 novel lncRNAs. The top six DE lncRNAs were selected based on large, consistent fold-changes in the RNA-Seq results. Three of these candidates passed RT-qPCR validation, including AC009014.3 (P <.001 in tumor tissue) and a newly discovered X-linked lncRNA named XPLAID (P =.049 in tumor tissue and P =.048 in normal tissue). XPLAID and AC009014.3 show promise as prognostic biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered several dozen lncRNAs that distinguish aggressive and indolent prostate cancers, of which four were validated using RT-qPCR. The investigation into their biology is ongoing. © 2018

AB  - Rfam is a database of non-coding RNA families in which each family is represented by a multiple sequence alignment, a consensus secondary structure, and a covariance model. Using a combination of manual and literature-based curation and a custom software pipeline, Rfam converts descriptions of RNA families found in the scientific literature into computational models that can be used to annotate RNAs belonging to those families in any DNA or RNA sequence. Valuable research outputs that are often locked up in figures and supplementary information files are encapsulated in Rfam entries and made accessible through the Rfam Web site. The data produced by Rfam have a broad application, from genome annotation to providing training sets for algorithm development. This article gives an overview of how to search and navigate the Rfam Web site, and how to annotate sequences with RNA families.

AB  - 17α-Ethinylestradiol (EE2) is a ubiquitous aquatic contaminant shown to decrease fish fertility at low concentrations, especially in fish exposed during development. The mechanisms of the decreased fertility are not fully understood. In this study, we perform transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing of testes from zebrafish with previously reported lowered fertility due to exposure to low concentrations of EE2 during development. Fish were exposed to 1.2 and 1.6 ng/L (measured concentration; nominal concentrations 3 and 10 ng/L) of EE2 from fertilization to 80 days of age, followed by 82 days of remediation in clean water. RNA sequencing analysis revealed 249 and 16 genes to be differentially expressed after exposure to 1.2 and 1.6 ng/L, respectively; a larger inter-sample variation was noted in the latter. Expression of 11 genes were altered by both exposures and in the same direction. The coding sequences most affected could be categorized to the putative functions cell signalling, proteolysis, protein metabolic transport and lipid metabolic process. Several homeobox transcription factors involved in development and differentiation showed increased expression in response to EE2 and differential expression of genes related to cell death, differentiation and proliferation was observed. In addition, several genes related to steroid synthesis, testis development and function were differentially expressed. A number of genes associated with spermatogenesis in zebrafish and/or mouse were also found to be differentially expressed. Further, differences in non-coding sequences were observed, among them several differentially expressed miRNA that might contribute to testis gene regulation at post-transcriptional level. This study has generated insights of changes in gene expression that accompany fertility alterations in zebrafish males that persist after developmental exposure to environmental relevant concentrations of EE2 that persist followed by clean water to adulthood. Hopefully, this will generate hypotheses to test in search for mechanistic explanations. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells are a potentially powerful tool for high-throughput screening (HTS), but the complexity of organoid cultures poses a significant challenge for miniaturization and automation. Here, we present a fully automated, HTS-compatible platform for enhanced differentiation and phenotyping of human kidney organoids. The entire 21-day protocol, from plating to differentiation to analysis, can be performed automatically by liquid-handling robots, or alternatively by manual pipetting. High-content imaging analysis reveals both dose-dependent and threshold effects during organoid differentiation. Immunofluorescence and single-cell RNA sequencing identify previously undetected parietal, interstitial, and partially differentiated compartments within organoids and define conditions that greatly expand the vascular endothelium. Chemical modulation of toxicity and disease phenotypes can be quantified for safety and efficacy prediction. Screening in gene-edited organoids in this system reveals an unexpected role for myosin in polycystic kidney disease. Organoids in HTS formats thus establish an attractive platform for multidimensional phenotypic screening. Organoids derived from human iPSCs have great potential for drug screening, but their complexity poses a challenge for miniaturization and automation. Freedman and colleagues establish a robotic pipeline to manufacture and analyze kidney organoids in microwell arrays. They apply this system to improve differentiation, measure toxicity, and comprehend disease. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Prostate carcinoma (PCa) is the second most common malignant disease in men. Despite evidence that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening can reduce PCa specific metastasis and death, it has not accepted by various health authorities. In fact, a broad range of heterogeneity causes different clinical and molecular behavior of PCa; risk stratification thus is helpful in guiding the optimal treatment of PCa patients. Methods: Here, we proposed a novel frame to perform risk stratification and identify PCa risk-related genes via integration of PCa omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Firstly, risk genes were extracted by applying Cox regression model. Secondly, consensus non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) cluster algorithm was applied to RNA-seq expression data of these risk genes, and PCa patients were divided into two subtypes (named as low risk and high risk respectively). Thirdly, by combining with survival analysis and differential expression analysis based on two subtypes, a PCa subtype-related network module was identified. Results: The identified network module can serve as biomarkers such as SRC to predict PCa risk. In particular, we observed the obvious differences in the DNA methylation profile and copy number variation (CNV) of genes involved in the module between two PCa subtypes. Conclusions: The framework proposed in this paper provides an effective strategy for the comprehensive analysis of TCGA omics data and can help highlight the prevention and treatment stratification for PCa patients. ©Translational Cancer Research.

AB  - Background: The advent of -omics technologies has enabled the resolution of fine molecular differences among individuals within a species. DNA sequence variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms or small deletions, can be tabulated for many kinds of genotype comparisons. However, experimental designs and analytical approaches are replete with ways to overestimate the level of variation present within a given sample. Analytical pipelines that do not apply proper thresholds nor assess reproducibility among samples are susceptible to calling false-positive variants. Furthermore, issues with sample genotype identity or failing to account for heterogeneity in reference genotypes may lead to misinterpretations of standing variants as polymorphisms derived de novo. Results: A recent publication that featured the analysis of RNA-sequencing data in three transgenic soybean event series appeared to overestimate the number of sequence variants identified in plants that were exposed to a tissue culture based transformation process. We reanalyzed these data with a stringent set of criteria and demonstrate three different factors that lead to variant overestimation, including issues related to the genetic identity of the background genotype, unaccounted genetic heterogeneity in the reference genome, and insufficient bioinformatics filtering. Conclusions: This study serves as a cautionary tale to users of genomic and transcriptomic data that wish to assess the molecular variation attributable to tissue culture and transformation processes. Moreover, accounting for the factors that lead to sequence variant overestimation is equally applicable to samples derived from other germplasm sources, including chemical or irradiation mutagenesis and genome engineering (e.g., CRISPR) processes. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has significantly deepened our insights into complex tissues, with the latest techniques capable of processing tens of thousands of cells simultaneously. Analyzing increasing numbers of cells, however, generates extremely large data sets, extending processing time and challenging computing resources. Current scRNA-seq analysis tools are not designed to interrogate large data sets and often lack sensitivity to identify marker genes. With bigSCale, we provide a scalable analytical framework to analyze millions of cells, which addresses the challenges associated with large data sets. To handle the noise and sparsity of scRNA-seq data, bigSCale uses large sample sizes to estimate an accurate numerical model of noise. The framework further includes modules for differential expression analysis, cell clustering, and marker identification. A directed convolution strategy allows processing of extremely large data sets, while preserving transcript information from individual cells. We evaluated the performance of bigSCale using both a biological model of aberrant gene expression in patient-derived neuronal progenitor cells and simulated data sets, which underlines the speed and accuracy in differential expression analysis. To test its applicability for large data sets, we applied bigSCale to assess 1.3 million cells from the mouse developing forebrain. Its directed down-sampling strategy accumulates information from single cells into index cell transcriptomes, thereby defining cellular clusters with improved resolution. Accordingly, index cell clusters identified rare populations, such as reelin (Reln)-positive Cajal-Retzius neurons, for which we report previously unrecognized heterogeneity associated with distinct differentiation stages, spatial organization, and cellular function. Together, bigSCale presents a solution to address future challenges of large single-cell data sets. © 2018 Iacono et al.

AB  - The vascular plant pathogen Verticillium nonalfalfae causes Verticillium wilt in several important crops. VnaSSP4.2 was recently discovered as a V. nonalfalfae virulence effector protein in the xylem sap of infected hop. Here, we expanded our search for candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) in the V. nonalfalfae predicted secretome using a bioinformatic pipeline built on V. nonalfalfae genome data, RNA-Seq and proteomic studies of the interaction with hop. The secretome, rich in carbohydrate active enzymes, proteases, redox proteins and proteins involved in secondary metabolism, cellular processing and signaling, includes 263 CSEPs. Several homologs of known fungal effectors (LysM, NLPs, Hce2, Cerato-platanins, Cyanovirin-N lectins, hydrophobins and CFEM domain containing proteins) and avirulence determinants in the PHI database (Avr-Pita1 and MgSM1) were found. The majority of CSEPs were non-annotated and were narrowed down to 44 top priority candidates based on their likelihood of being effectors. These were examined by spatiotemporal gene expression profiling of infected hop. Among the highest in planta expressed CSEPs, five deletion mutants were tested in pathogenicity assays. A deletion mutant of VnaUn.279, a lethal pathotype specific gene with sequence similarity to SAM-dependent methyltransferase (LaeA), had lower infectivity and showed highly reduced virulence, but no changes in morphology, fungal growth or conidiation were observed. Several putative secreted effector proteins that probably contribute to V. nonalfalfae colonization of hop were identified in this study. Among them, LaeA gene homolog was found to act as a potential novel virulence effector of V. nonalfalfae. The combined results will serve for future characterization of V. nonalfalfae effectors, which will advance our understanding of Verticillium wilt disease. © 2018 Marton et al.

AB  - The current study aimed to identify novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with gastric cancer (GC). Transcriptome sequencing of the lncRNAs and mRNAs from GC tissues and normal adjacent tissues was performed. The data were analyzed using bioinformatics analysis, specifically analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNA, target gene prediction and functional enrichment analysis. A total of 1,181 differentially expressed mRNA and 390 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified. The targets of upregulated lncRNAs were significantly enriched in functions associated with collagen fibril organization, whereas the downregulated lncRNA were significantly associated with ion transmembrane transport and regulation of membrane potential. A total of 7 lncRNAs were verified by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Following RT-qPCR validation, AC016735.2, AP001626.1, RP11-400N13.3 and RP11-243M5.2 were considered to be consistent with the prediction of the bioinformatics analysis. Transcriptome sequencing and RT-qPCR experiments identified 4 lncRNAs, including AC016735.2, AP001626.1, RP11-400N13.3 and RP11-243M5.2 to have an important role in the carcinogenesis of GC. © 2018 Spandidos Publications.

AB  - Boron (B), a trace element found in the human body, plays an important role for health of bone by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. Our research group previously fabricated B-mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) scaffolds, which successfully promoted osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts when compared to pure MBG scaffolds without boron. However, the mechanisms of the positive effect of B-MBG scaffolds on osteogenesis remain unknown. Therefore, we performed in-vivo experiments in OVX rat models with pure MBG scaffolds and compared them to B-MBG scaffold. As a result, we found that B-MBG scaffold induced more new bone regeneration compared to pure MBG scaffold and examined genes related to bone regeneration induced by B-MBG scaffold through RNA-seq to obtain target genes and epigenetic mechanisms. The results demonstrated an increased expression and affiliation of Setd7 in the B-MBG group when compared to the MBG group. Immunofluorescent staining from our in vivo samples further demonstrated a higher localization of Setd7 and H3K4me3 in Runx2-positive cells in defects treated with B-MBG scaffolds. KEGG results suggested that specifically Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was highly activated in new bone area associated with B-MBG scaffolds. Thereafter, in vitro studies with human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) stimulated by extracted liquid of B-MBG scaffolds was associated with significantly elevated levels of Setd7, as well as H3K4me3 when compared to MBG scaffolds alone. To verify the role of Setd7 in new bone formation in the presence of Boron, Setd7 was knocked down in hBMSCs with stimulation of the extracted liquids of B-MBG or MBG scaffolds. The result showed that osteoblast differentiation of hBMSCs was inhibited when Setd7 was knocked down, which could not be rescued by the extracted liquids of B-MBG scaffolds confirming its role in osteoblast differentiation and bone regeneration. As a histone methylase, Setd7 may be expected to be a potential epigenetic target for new treatment schemes of osteoporosis. Statement of Significance: Boron-containing MBG scaffold has already been proved to promote bone regeneration in femoral defects of OVX rats by our research group, however, the epigenetic mechanism of Boron's positive effects on bone generation remains ill-informed. In our present study, we found an increased expression and affiliation of Setd7 and H3K4me3 in Runx2-positive osteoblasts in vivo. And in vitro, the higher expression of Setd7 enhanced osteogenic differentiation of human BMSCs stimulated by extracted liquids of B-MBG scaffold compared to MBG scaffold, which was associated with the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Above all, it suggests that Setd7 plays an positive role in osteogenic differentiation and it may become a potential epigenetic target for new schemes for osteoporosis. © 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB  - Splice variants are known to be important in the pathophysiology of tumors, including the brain cancers. We applied a proteogenomics pipeline to identify splice variants in glioblastoma (GBM, grade IV glioma), a highly malignant brain tumor, using in-house generated mass spectrometric proteomic data and public domain RNASeq dataset. Our analysis led to the identification of a novel exon that maps to the long isoform of Neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1), expressed on the surface of glial cells and neurons, important for cell adhesion and cell signaling. The presence of the novel exon is supported with the identification of five peptides spanning it. Additional peptides were also detected in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel separated proteins from GBM patient tissue, underscoring the presence of the novel peptides in the intact brain protein. The novel exon was detected in the RNASeq dataset in 18 of 25 GBM samples and separately validated in additional 10 GBM tumor tissues using quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Both transcriptomic and proteomic data indicate downregulation of NCAM1, including the novel variant, in GBM. Domain analysis of the novel NCAM1 sequence indicates that the insertion of the novel exon contributes extra low-complexity region in the protein that may be important for protein-protein interactions and hence for cell signaling associated with tumor development. Taken together, the novel NCAM1 variant reported in this study exemplifies the importance of future multiomics research and systems biology applications in GBM. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Background: Treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer (tNEPC) is an aggressive variant of late-stage metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer that commonly arises through neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (NEtD). Treatment options are limited, ineffective, and, for most patients, result in death in less than a year. We previously developed a first-in-field patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of NEtD. Longitudinal deep transcriptome profiling of this model enabled monitoring of dynamic transcriptional changes during NEtD and in the context of androgen deprivation. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are implicated in cancer where they can control gene regulation. Until now, the expression of lncRNAs during NEtD and their clinical associations were unexplored. Results: We implemented a next-generation sequence analysis pipeline that can detect transcripts at low expression levels and built a genome-wide catalogue (n = 37,749) of lncRNAs. We applied this pipeline to 927 clinical samples and our high-fidelity NEtD model LTL331 and identified 821 lncRNAs in NEPC. Among these are 122 lncRNAs that robustly distinguish NEPC from prostate adenocarcinoma (AD) patient tumours. The highest expressed lncRNAs within this signature are H19, LINC00617, and SSTR5-AS1. Another 742 are associated with the NEtD process and fall into four distinct patterns of expression (NEtD lncRNA Class I, II, III, and IV) in our PDX model and clinical samples. Each class has significant (z-scores > 2) and unique enrichment for transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs in their sequences. Enriched TFBS include (1) TP53 and BRN1 in Class I, (2) ELF5, SPIC, and HOXD1 in Class II, (3) SPDEF in Class III, (4) HSF1 and FOXA1 in Class IV, and (5) TWIST1 when merging Class III with IV. Common TFBS in all NEtD lncRNA were also identified and include E2F, REST, PAX5, PAX9, and STAF. Interrogation of the top deregulated candidates (n = 100) in radical prostatectomy adenocarcinoma samples with long-term follow-up (median 18 years) revealed significant clinicopathological associations. Specifically, we identified 25 that are associated with rapid metastasis following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Two of these lncRNAs (SSTR5-AS1 and LINC00514) stratified patients undergoing ADT based on patient outcome. Discussion: To date, a comprehensive characterization of the dynamic landscape of lncRNAs during the NEtD process has not been performed. A temporal analysis of the PDX-based NEtD model has for the first time provided this dynamic landscape. TFBS analysis identified NEPC-related TF motifs present within the NEtD lncRNA sequences, suggesting functional roles for these lncRNAs in NEPC pathogenesis. Furthermore, select NEtD lncRNAs appear to be associated with metastasis and patients receiving ADT. Treatment-related metastasis is a clinical consequence of NEPC tumours. Top candidate lncRNAs FENDRR, H19, LINC00514, LINC00617, and SSTR5-AS1 identified in this study are implicated in the development of NEPC. We present here for the first time a genome-wide catalogue of NEtD lncRNAs that characterize the transdifferentiation process and a robust NEPC lncRNA patient expression signature. To accomplish this, we carried out the largest integrative study that applied a PDX NEtD model to clinical samples. These NEtD and NEPC lncRNAs are strong candidates for clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets and warrant further investigation. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Tourette Disorder (TD) is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the presence of both motor and vocal tics. The genetic architecture of TD is believed to be complex and heterogeneous. Nevertheless, DNA sequence variants co-segregating with TD phenotypes within multiplex families have been identified. This report examines whole exomes of affected and unaffected individuals in a multiplex TD family to discover genes involved in the TD etiology. We performed whole exome sequencing on six out of nine members in a three-generation TD multiplex family. Putative deleterious sequence variants co-segregating with TD patients were identified by our in-house bioinformatics pipeline. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from one unaffected and two TD affected individuals. Neurons were derived from the iPSCs and biochemical assays were conducted to evaluate possible molecular differences between affected and unaffected. A rare heterozygous nonsense mutation in PNKD was co-segregated with TD in this multiplex family. Transcript and protein levels of the PNKD long isoform were reduced in neurons derived from the individuals with TD due to the nonsense mutation, indicating nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. We demonstrated that the PNKD long isoform monomer oligomerizes with itself as well as interacts with the synaptic active zone protein RIMS1α. We concluded that reduced PNKD long isoform levels are detected in all affected individuals and we provide evidence for a mechanism whereby this might contribute to the TD phenotype. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Genetic susceptibility to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) may lie within genes regulating or activating the alternate complement and related pathways converging on endothelial cell activation. Methods: We tested 32 Indian patients of aHUS negative for antibodies to complement factor H for genetic variations in a panel of 15 genes, i.e., CFH, CFHR1-5, CFI, CFB, C3, CD46, MASP2, DGKE, ADAMTS13, THBD and PLG using next-generation DNA sequencing and for copy number variation in CFHR1-3. Results: Despite absence of a public database of exome variations in the Indian population and limited functional studies, we could establish a genetic diagnosis in 6 (18.8%) patients using a stringent scheme of prioritization. One patient carried a likely pathogenic variation. The number of patients carrying possibly pathogenic variation was as follows: 1 variation: 5 patients, 2 variations: 9 patients, 3 variations: 5 patients, 4 variations: 9 patients, 5 variations: 2 patients and 6 variations: 2 patients. Homozygous deletion of CFHR1-3 was present in five patients; none of these carried a diagnostic genetic variation. Patients with or without diagnostic variation did not differ significantly in terms of enrichment of genetic variations that were rare/novel or predicted deleterious, or for possible environmental triggers. Conclusion: We conclude that genetic testing for multiple genes in patients with aHUS negative for anti-FH antibodies reveals multiple candidate variations that require prioritization. Population data on variation frequency of the Indian population and supportive functional studies are likely to improve diagnostic yield. © 2017, Japanese Society of Nephrology.

AB  - Read counting and unique molecular identifier (UMI) counting are the principal gene expression quantification schemes used in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. By using multiple scRNA-seq datasets, we reveal distinct distribution differences between these schemes and conclude that the negative binomial model is a good approximation for UMI counts, even in heterogeneous populations. We further propose a novel differential expression analysis algorithm based on a negative binomial model with independent dispersions in each group (NBID). Our results show that this properly controls the FDR and achieves better power for UMI counts when compared to other recently developed packages for scRNA-seq analysis. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Genome annotation is of key importance in many research questions. The identification of protein-coding genes is often based on transcriptome sequencing data, ab-initio or homology-based prediction. Recently, it was demonstrated that intron position conservation improves homology-based gene prediction, and that experimental data improves ab-initio gene prediction. Results: Here, we present an extension of the gene prediction program GeMoMa that utilizes amino acid sequence conservation, intron position conservation and optionally RNA-seq data for homology-based gene prediction. We show on published benchmark data for plants, animals and fungi that GeMoMa performs better than the gene prediction programs BRAKER1, MAKER2, and CodingQuarry, and purely RNA-seq-based pipelines for transcript identification. In addition, we demonstrate that using multiple reference organisms may help to further improve the performance of GeMoMa. Finally, we apply GeMoMa to four nematode species and to the recently published barley reference genome indicating that current annotations of protein-coding genes may be refined using GeMoMa predictions. Conclusions: GeMoMa might be of great utility for annotating newly sequenced genomes but also for finding homologs of a specific gene or gene family.

AB  - Background: Thinning supplies of natural resources increase attention to sustainable microbial production of bio-based fuels. The strain Clostridium beijerinckii NRRL B-598 is a relatively well-described butanol producer regarding its genotype and phenotype under various conditions. However, a link between these two levels, lying in the description of the gene regulation mechanisms, is missing for this strain, due to the lack of transcriptomic data. Results: In this paper, we present a transcription profile of the strain over the whole fermentation using an RNA-Seq dataset covering six time-points with the current highest dynamic range among solventogenic clostridia. We investigated the accuracy of the genome sequence and particular genome elements, including pseudogenes and prophages. While some pseudogenes were highly expressed, all three identified prophages remained silent. Furthermore, we identified major changes in the transcriptional activity of genes using differential expression analysis between adjacent time-points. We identified functional groups of these significantly regulated genes and together with fermentation and cultivation kinetics captured using liquid chromatography and flow cytometry, we identified basic changes in the metabolism of the strain during fermentation. Interestingly, C. beijerinckii NRRL B-598 demonstrated different behavior in comparison with the closely related strain C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 in the latter phases of cultivation. Conclusions: We provided a complex analysis of the C. beijerinckii NRRL B-598 fermentation profile using several technologies, including RNA-Seq. We described the changes in the global metabolism of the strain and confirmed the uniqueness of its behavior. The whole experiment demonstrated a good reproducibility. Therefore, we will be able to repeat the experiment under selected conditions in order to investigate particular metabolic changes and signaling pathways suitable for following targeted engineering. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Complex microbial communities are an area of growing interest in biology. Metatranscriptomics allows researchers to quantify microbial gene expression in an environmental sample via high-throughput sequencing. Metatranscriptomic experiments are computationally intensive because the experiments generate a large volume of sequence data and each sequence must be compared with reference sequences from thousands of organisms. Results: SAMSA2 is an upgrade to the original Simple Annotation of Metatranscriptomes by Sequence Analysis (SAMSA) pipeline that has been redesigned for standalone use on a supercomputing cluster. SAMSA2 is faster due to the use of the DIAMOND aligner, and more flexible and reproducible because it uses local databases. SAMSA2 is available with detailed documentation, and example input and output files along with examples of master scripts for full pipeline execution. Conclusions: SAMSA2 is a rapid and efficient metatranscriptome pipeline for analyzing large RNA-seq datasets in a supercomputing cluster environment. SAMSA2 provides simplified output that can be examined directly or used for further analyses, and its reference databases may be upgraded, altered or customized to fit the needs of any experiment. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status is a predictive biomarker in glioblastoma patients. Glioblastoma without hypermethylated MGMT promoter is largely resistant to treatment with temozolomide. These patients are in particular need of new treatment approaches, which are offered by biomarker-driven clinical trials with targeted drugs based on molecular characterization of individual tumors. Methods In preparation for an upcoming clinical study, a comprehensive molecular profiling approach was undertaken on tissues from 43 glioblastoma patients harboring an unmethylated MGMT promoter at diagnosis. The diagnostic pipeline covered various levels of molecular characteristics, including whole-exome sequencing, low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, as well as microarray-based gene expression profiling and DNA methylation arrays. Results Complex multilayer molecular diagnostics were feasible in this setting with a median turnaround time of 4-5 weeks from surgery to the molecular tumor board. In 35% of cases, potentially relevant therapeutic decisions were derived from the data. Alterations were most frequently found in receptor tyrosine kinases, members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway as well as cell cycle control and p53 regulation cascades. Individual tumors harbored clonal alterations such as oncogenic fusions of tyrosine kinases which constitute promising targets for targeted therapies. A prioritization algorithm is proposed to allocate patients with multiple targets to the potentially best treatment option. Conclusion With this feasibility study, a comprehensive molecular profiling approach for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma harboring an unmethylated MGMT promoter is presented. Analyses in this pilot cohort serve as a basis for trials based on targetable alterations and on the question of allocation of patients to the best treatment arm. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - To life scientists, one important feature offered by RNAseq, a next-generation sequencing tool used to estimate changes in gene expression levels, lies in its unprecedented resolution. It can score countable differences in transcript numbers among thousands of genes and between experimental groups, all at once. However, its high cost limits experimental designs to very small sample sizes, usually N = 3, which often results in statistically underpowered analysis and poor reproducibility. All these issues are compounded by the presence of experimental noise, which is harder to distinguish from instrumental error when sample sizes are limiting (e.g., small-budget pilot tests), experimental populations exhibit biologically heterogeneous or diffuse expression phenotypes (e.g., patient samples), or when discriminating among transcriptional signatures of closely related experimental conditions (e.g., toxicological modes of action, or MOAs). Here, we present a leveraged signal-to-noise ratio (LSTNR) thresholding method, founded on generalized linear modeling (GLM) of aligned read detection limits to extract differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from noisy low-replication RNAseq data. The LSTNR method uses an agnostic independent filtering strategy to define the dynamic range of detected aggregate read counts per gene, and assigns statistical weights that prioritize genes with better sequencing resolution in differential expression analyses. To assess its performance, we implemented the LSTNR method to analyze three separate datasets: first, using a systematically noisy in silico dataset, we demonstrated that LSTNR can extract pre-designed patterns of expression and discriminate between "noise" and "true" differentially expressed pseudogenes at a 100% success rate; then, we illustrated how the LSTNR method can assign patient-derived breast cancer specimens correctly to one out of their four reported molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, Her2-enriched and basal-like); and last, we showed the ability to retrieve five different modes of action (MOA) elicited in livers of rats exposed to three toxicants under three nutritional routes by using the LSTNR method. By combining differential measurements with resolving power to detect DEGs, the LSTNR method offers an alternative approach to interrogate noisy and low-replication RNAseq datasets, which handles multiple biological conditions at once, and defines benchmarks to validate RNAseq experiments with standard benchtop assays. © 2018 Lozoya, Santos and Woychik.

AB  - Background: Cryptosporidium baileyi is the most common Cryptosporidium species in birds. However, effective prevention measures and treatment for C. baileyi infection were still not available. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in regulating occurrence and progression of many diseases and are identified as effective biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of several diseases. In the present study, the expression profiles of host mRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs associated with C. baileyi infection were investigated for the first time. Results: The tracheal tissues of experimental (C. baileyi infection) and control chickens were collected for deep RNA sequencing, and 545,479,934 clean reads were obtained. Of them, 1376 novel lncRNAs were identified, including 1161 long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) and 215 anti-sense lncRNAs. A total of 124 lncRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed between the experimental and control groups. Additionally, 14,698 mRNAs and 9085 circRNAs were identified, and significantly different expressions were observed for 1317 mRNAs and 104 circRNAs between two groups. Bioinformatic analyses of gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway for their targets and source genes suggested that these dysregulated genes may be involved in the interaction between the host and C. baileyi. Conclusions: The present study revealed the expression profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs during C. baileyi infection for the first time, and sheds lights on the roles of lncRNAs and circRNAs underlying the pathogenesis of Cryptosporidium infection. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Functional RNAs can fold into intricate structures using a number of different secondary and tertiary structural motifs. Many factors contribute to the overall free energy of the target fold. This study aims at quantifying the entropic costs coming from the loss of conformational freedom when the sugar-phosphate backbone is subjected to constraints imposed by secondary and tertiary contacts. Motivated by insights from topology theory, we design a diagrammatic scheme to represent different types of RNA structures so that constraints associated with a folded structure may be segregated into mutually independent subsets, enabling the total conformational entropy loss to be easily calculated as a sum of independent terms. We used high-throughput Monte Carlo simulations to simulate large ensembles of single-stranded RNA sequences in solution to validate the assumptions behind our diagrammatic scheme, examining the entropic costs for hairpin initiation and formation of many multiway junctions. Our diagrammatic scheme aids in the factorization of secondary/tertiary constraints into distinct topological classes and facilitates the discovery of interrelationships among multiple constraints on RNA folds. This perspective, which to our knowledge is novel, leads to useful insights into the inner workings of some functional RNA sequences, demonstrating how they might operate by transforming their structures among different topological classes. © 2018 Biophysical Society

AB  - Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses can benefit from performing a genome-guided and de novo assembly, in particular for species where the reference genome or the annotation is incomplete. However, tools for integrating an assembled transcriptome with reference annotation are lacking. Findings: Necklace is a software pipeline that runs genome-guided and de novo assembly and combines the resulting transcriptomes with reference genome annotations. Necklace constructs a compact but comprehensive superTranscriptome out of the assembled and reference data. Reads are subsequently aligned and counted in preparation for differential expression testing. Conclusions: Necklace allows a comprehensive transcriptome to be built from a combination of assembled and annotated transcripts, which results in a more comprehensive transcriptome for the majority of organisms. In addition RNA-seq data are mapped back to this newly created superTranscript reference to enable differential expression testing with standard methods.

AB  - Background Pipeline comparisons for gene expression data are highly valuable for applied real data analyses, as they enable the selection of suitable analysis strategies for the dataset at hand. Such pipelines for RNA-Seq data should include mapping of reads, counting and differential gene expression analysis or preprocessing, normalization and differential gene expression in case of microarray analysis, in order to give a global insight into pipeline performances. Methods Four commonly used RNA-Seq pipelines (STAR/HTSeq-Count/edgeR, STAR/RSEM/ edgeR, Sailfish/edgeR, TopHat2/Cufflinks/CuffDiff)) were investigated on multiple levels (alignment and counting) and cross-compared with the microarray counterpart on the level of gene expression and gene ontology enrichment. For these comparisons we generated two matched microarray and RNA-Seq datasets: Burkitt Lymphoma cell line data and rectal cancer patient data. Results The overall mapping rate of STAR was 98.98% for the cell line dataset and 98.49% for the patient dataset. Tophat’s overall mapping rate was 97.02% and 96.73%, respectively, while Sailfish had only an overall mapping rate of 84.81% and 54.44%. The correlation of gene expression in microarray and RNA-Seq data was moderately worse for the patient dataset (ρ = 0.67–0.69) than for the cell line dataset (ρ = 0.87–0.88). An exception were the correlation results of Cufflinks, which were substantially lower (ρ = 0.21–0.29 and 0.34–0.53). For both datasets we identified very low numbers of differentially expressed genes using the microarray platform. For RNA-Seq we checked the agreement of differentially expressed genes identified in the different pipelines and of GO-term enrichment results. Conclusion In conclusion the combination of STAR aligner with HTSeq-Count followed by STAR aligner with RSEM and Sailfish generated differentially expressed genes best suited for the dataset at hand and in agreement with most of the other transcriptomics pipelines. © 2018 Wolff et al.

AB  - Motivation A key component in many RNA-Seq-based studies is contrasting multiple replicates from different experimental conditions. In this setup, replicates play a key role as they allow to capture underlying biological variability inherent to the compared conditions, as well as experimental variability. However, what constitutes a € bad' replicate is not necessarily well defined. Consequently, researchers might discard valuable data or downstream analysis may be hampered by failed experiments. Results Here we develop a probability model to weigh a given RNA-Seq sample as a representative of an experimental condition when performing alternative splicing analysis. We demonstrate that this model detects outlier samples which are consistently and significantly different compared with other samples from the same condition. Moreover, we show that instead of discarding such samples the proposed weighting scheme can be used to downweight samples and specific splicing variations suspected as outliers, gaining statistical power. These weights can then be used for differential splicing (DS) analysis, where the resulting algorithm offers a generalization of the MAJIQ algorithm. Using both synthetic and real-life data, we perform an extensive evaluation of the improved MAJIQ algorithm in different scenarios involving perturbed samples, mislabeled samples, same condition groups, and different levels of coverage, showing it compares favorably to other tools. Overall, this work offers an outlier detection algorithm that can be combined with any splicing pipeline, a generalized and improved version of MAJIQ for DS detection, and evaluation metrics with matching code and data for DS algorithms.

AB  - The advances in genomic sequencing during the past few years have motivated the development of fast and reliable software for DNA/RNA sequencing on current high performance architectures. Most of these efforts target multicore processors, only a few can also exploit graphics processing units, and a much smaller set will run in clusters equipped with any of these multi-threaded architecture technologies. Furthermore, the examples that can be used on clusters today are all strongly coupled with a particular aligner. In this paper we introduce an alignment framework that can be leveraged to coordinately run any “single-node” aligner, taking advantage of the resources of a cluster without having to modify any portion of the original software. The key to our transparent migration lies in hiding the complexity associated with the multi-node execution (such as coordinating the processes running in the cluster nodes) inside the generic-aligner framework. Moreover, following the design and operation in our Message Passing Interface (MPI) version of HPG Aligner RNA BWT, we organize the framework into two stages in order to be able to execute different aligners in each one of them. With this configuration, for example, the first stage can ideally apply a fast aligner to accelerate the process, while the second one can be tuned to act as a refinement stage that further improves the global alignment process with little cost. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Small RNA sequencing is the most widely used tool for microRNA (miRNA) discovery, and shows great potential for the efficient study of miRNA cross-species transport, i.e., by detecting the presence of exogenous miRNA sequences in the host species. Because of the increased appreciation of dietary miRNAs and their far-reaching implication in human health, research interests are currently growing with regard to exogenous miRNAs bioavailability, mechanisms of cross-species transport and miRNA function in cellular biological processes. In this article, we present microRNA Discovery (miRDis), a new small RNA sequencing data analysis pipeline for both endogenous and exogenous miRNA detection. Specifically, we developed and deployed a Web service that supports the annotation and expression profiling data of known host miRNAs and the detection of novel miRNAs, other noncoding RNAs, and the exogenous miRNAs from dietary species. As a proofof- concept, we analyzed a set of human plasma sequencing data from a milk-feeding study where 225 human miRNAs were detected in the plasma samples and 44 show elevated expression after milk intake. By examining the bovine-specific sequences, data indicate that three bovine miRNAs (bta-miR-378, -181* and -150) are present in human plasma possibly because of the dietary uptake. Further evaluation based on different sets of public data demonstrates that miRDis outperforms other state-of-the-art tools in both detection and quantification of miRNA from either animal or plant sources.

AB  - The single-molecule real-time (SMRT) isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) based on Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) platform has received increasing attention for its ability to explore full-length isoforms. Thus, comprehensive tools for Iso-Seq bioinformatics analysis are extremely useful. Here, we present a one-stop solution for Iso-Seq analysis, called PRAPI to analyze alternative transcription initiation (ATI), alternative splicing (AS), alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA), natural antisense transcripts (NAT), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) comprehensively. PRAPI is capable of combining Iso-Seq full-length isoforms with short read data, such as RNA-Seq or polyadenylation site sequencing (PAS-seq) for differential expression analysis of NAT, AS, APA and circRNAs. Furthermore, PRAPI can annotate new genes and correct mis-annotated genes when gene annotation is available. Finally, PRAPI generates high-quality vector graphics to visualize and highlight the Iso-Seq results.

AB  - Postharvest aflatoxin contamination is a challenging issue that affects peanut quality. Aflatoxin is produced by fungi belonging to the Aspergilli group, and is known as an acutely toxic, carcinogenic, and immune-suppressing class of mycotoxins. Evidence for several host genetic factors that may impact aflatoxin contamination has been reported, e.g., genes for lipoxygenase (PnLOX1 and PnLOX2/PnLOX3 that showed either positive or negative regulation with Aspergillus infection), reactive oxygen species, and WRKY (highly associated with or differentially expressed upon infection of maize with Aspergillus flavus); however, their roles remain unclear. Therefore, we conducted an RNA-sequencing experiment to differentiate gene response to the infection by A. flavus between resistant (ICG 1471) and susceptible (Florida-07) cultivated peanut genotypes. The gene expression profiling analysis was designed to reveal differentially expressed genes in response to the infection (infected vs. mock-treated seeds). In addition, the differential expression of the fungal genes was profiled. The study revealed the complexity of the interaction between the fungus and peanut seeds as the expression of a large number of genes was altered, including some in the process of plant defense to aflatoxin accumulation. Analysis of the experimental data with “keggseq,” a novel designed tool for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, showed the importance of α-linolenic acid metabolism, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, spliceosome, and carbon fixation and metabolism pathways in conditioning resistance to aflatoxin accumulation. In addition, coexpression network analysis was carried out to reveal the correlation of gene expression among peanut and fungal genes. The results showed the importance ofWRKY, toll/Interleukin1 receptor–nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat (TIR-NBS-LRR), ethylene, and heat shock proteins in the resistance mechanism. © 2018 by the Genetics Society of America.

AB  - Control of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability is an important aspect of gene regulation. The gold standard for measuring mRNA stability transcriptome-wide uses metabolic labeling, biochemical isolation of labeled RNA populations, and high-throughput sequencing. However, difficult normalization procedures have inhibited widespread adoption of this approach. Here, we present DRUID (for determination of rates using intron dynamics), a new computational pipeline that is robust, easy to use, and freely available. Our pipeline uses endogenous introns to normalize time course data and yields reproducible half-lives, even with data sets that were otherwise unusable. DRUID can handle data sets from a variety of organisms, spanning yeast to humans, and we even applied it retroactively on published data sets. We anticipate that DRUID will allow broad application of metabolic labeling for studies of transcript stability. © 2018 Lugowski et al.

AB  - Most of the research studies developed applying microarray technology to the characterization of different pathological states of any disease may fail in reaching statistically significant results. This is largely due to the small repertoire of analysed samples, and to the limitation in the number of states or pathologies usually addressed. Moreover, the influence of potential deviations on the gene expression quantification is usually disregarded. In spite of the continuous changes in omic sciences, reflected for instance in the emergence of new Next-Generation Sequencing-related technologies, the existing availability of a vast amount of gene expression microarray datasets should be properly exploited. Therefore, this work proposes a novel methodological approach involving the integration of several heterogeneous skin cancer series, and a later multiclass classifier design. This approach is thus a way to provide the clinicians with an intelligent diagnosis support tool based on the use of a robust set of selected biomarkers, which simultaneously distinguishes among different cancer-related skin states. To achieve this, a multi-platform combination of microarray datasets from Affymetrix and Illumina manufacturers was carried out. This integration is expected to strengthen the statistical robustness of the study as well as the finding of highly-reliable skin cancer biomarkers. Specifically, the designed operation pipeline has allowed the identification of a small subset of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from which to distinguish among 7 involved skin states. These genes were obtained from the assessment of a number of potential batch effects on the gene expression data. The biological interpretation of these genes was inspected in the specific literature to understand their underlying information in relation to skin cancer. Finally, in order to assess their possible effectiveness in cancer diagnosis, a cross-validation Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based classification including feature ranking was performed. The accuracy attained exceeded the 92% in overall recognition of the 7 different cancer-related skin states. The proposed integration scheme is expected to allow the co-integration with other state-of-the-art technologies such as RNA-seq. © 2018 Gálvez et al.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been proposed as a suitable tool for liquid biopsy in colorectal cancer (CRC), although most studies to date have focused almost exclusively on sequencing of panels of potential clinically actionable genes. We evaluated the clinical value of whole-exome sequencing (WES) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in plasma, with the goal of identifying differential clinical profiles in patients with CRC. To this end, we applied an original concept, “differential presence of exons” (DPE). We determined differences in levels of 379 exons in plasma cfDNA and used DPE analysis to cluster and classify patients with disseminated and localized disease. The resultant bioinformatics analysis pipeline allowed us to design a predictive DPE algorithm in a small subset of patients that could not be initially classified based on the selection criteria. This DPE suggests that these nucleic acids could be actively released by both tumor and nontumor cells as a means of intercellular communication and might thus play a role in the process of malignant transformation. DPE is a new technique for the study of plasma cfDNA by WES that might have predictive and prognostic value in patients with CRC. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Pyrenophora teres, P. teres f. teres (PTT) and P. teres f. maculata (PTM) cause significant diseases in barley, but little is known about the large-scale genomic differences that may distinguish the two forms. Comprehensive genome assemblies were constructed from long DNA reads, optical and genetic maps. As repeat masking in fungal genomes influences the final gene annotations, an accurate and reproducible pipeline was developed to ensure comparability between isolates. The genomes of the two forms are highly collinear, each composed of 12 chromosomes. Genome evolution in P. teres is characterized by genome fissuring through the insertion and expansion of transposable elements (TEs), a process that isolates blocks of genic sequence. The phenomenon is particularly pronounced in PTT, which has a larger, more repetitive genome than PTM and more recent transposon activity measured by the frequency and size of genome fissures. PTT has a longer cultivated host association and, notably, a greater range of host-pathogen genetic interactions compared to other Pyrenophora spp., a property which associates better with genome size than pathogen lifestyle. The two forms possess similar complements of TE families with Tc1/Mariner and LINE-like Tad-1 elements more abundant in PTT. Tad-1 was only detectable as vestigial fragments in PTM and, within the forms, differences in genome sizes and the presence and absence of several TE families indicated recent lineage invasions. Gene differences between P. teres forms are mainly associated with gene-sparse regions near or within TE-rich regions, with many genes possessing characteristics of fungal effectors. Instances of gene interruption by transposons resulting in pseudogenization were detected in PTT. In addition, both forms have a large complement of secondary metabolite gene clusters indicating significant capacity to produce an array of different molecules. This study provides genomic resources for functional genetics to help dissect factors underlying the host-pathogen interactions. © 2018 Syme, Martin, Wyatt, Lawrence, Muria-Gonzalez, Friesen and Ellwood.

AB  - Driven by the recent advances of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and an urgent need to decode complex human diseases, a multitude of large-scale studies were conducted recently that have resulted in an unprecedented volume of whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data, such as the Genotype Tissue Expression project (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). While these data offer new opportunities to identify the mechanisms underlying disease, the comparison of data from different sources remains challenging, due to differences in sample and data processing. Here, we developed a pipeline that processes and unifies RNA-seq data from different studies, which includes uniform realignment, gene expression quantification, and batch effect removal. We find that uniform alignment and quantification is not sufficient when combining RNA-seq data from different sources and that the removal of other batch effects is essential to facilitate data comparison. We have processed data from GTEx and TCGA and successfully corrected for study-specific biases, enabling comparative analysis between TCGA and GTEx. The normalized datasets are available for download on figshare. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Recently, selection in pigs has been focused on improving the lean meat content in carcasses; this focus has been most evident in breeds constituting a paternal component in breeding. Such sire-breeds are used to improve the meat quantity of cross-breed pig lines. However, even in one breed, a significant variation in the meatiness level can be observed. In the present study, the comprehensive analysis of genes and microRNA expression profiles in porcine muscle tissue was applied to identify the genetic background of meat content. The comparison was performed between whole gene expression and miRNA profiles of muscle tissue collected from two sire-line pig breeds (Pietrain, Hampshire). The RNA-seq approach allowed the identification of 627 and 416 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pig groups differing in terms of loin weight between Pietrain and Hampshire breeds, respectively. The comparison of miRNA profiles showed differential expression of 57 microRNAs for Hampshire and 34 miRNAs for Pietrain pigs. Next, 43 genes and 18 miRNAs were selected as differentially expressed in both breeds and potentially related to muscle development. According to Gene Ontology analysis, identified DEGs and microRNAs were involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, fatty acid biosynthesis and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The most deregulated pathways dependent on muscle mass were the Hippo signalling pathway connected with the TGF-β signalling pathway and controlling organ size via the regulation of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, cell proliferation and apoptosis. The identified target genes were also involved in pathways such as the FoxO signalling pathway, signalling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells and the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. The obtained results indicate molecular mechanisms controlling porcine muscle growth and development. Identified genes (SOX2, SIRT1, KLF4, PAX6 and genes belonging to the transforming growth factor beta superfamily) could be considered candidate genes for determining muscle mass in pigs. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Honeybee development consists of four stages: embryo, larva, pupa and adult. Embryogenesis, a key process of cell division and differentiation, takes 3 days in honeybees. However, the embryonic transcriptome and the dynamic regulation of embryonic transcription are still largely uncharacterized in honeybees, especially in the Asian honeybee (Apis cerana). Here, we employed high-quality RNA-seq to explore the transcriptome of Asian honeybee embryos at three ages, approximately 24, 48 and 72 h (referred to as Day1, Day2 and Day3, respectively). Results: Nine embryo samples, three from each age, were collected for RNA-seq. According to the staging scheme of honeybee embryos and the morphological features we observed, our Day1, Day2 and Day3 embryos likely corresponded to the late stage four, stage eight and stage ten development stages, respectively. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis showed that same-age samples were grouped together, and the Day2 samples had a closer relationship with the Day3 samples than the Day1 samples. Finally, a total of 18,284 genes harboring 55,646 transcripts were detected in the A. cerana embryos, of which 44.5% consisted of the core transcriptome shared by all three ages of embryos. A total of 4088 upregulated and 3046 downregulated genes were identified among the three embryo ages, of which 2010, 3177 and 1528 genes were upregulated and 2088, 2294 and 303 genes were downregulated from Day1 to Day2, from Day1 to Day3 and from Day2 to Day3, respectively. The downregulated genes were mostly involved in cellular, biosynthetic and metabolic processes, gene expression and protein localization, and macromolecule modification; the upregulated genes mainly participated in cell development and differentiation, tissue, organ and system development, and morphogenesis. Interestingly, several biological processes related to the response to and detection of light stimuli were enriched in the first-day A. cerana embryogenesis but not in the Apis mellifera embryogenesis, which was valuable for further investigations. Conclusions: Our transcriptomic data substantially expand the number of known transcribed elements in the A. cerana genome and provide a high-quality view of the transcriptome dynamics of A. cerana embryonic development. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Identifying regulons of sigma factors is a vital subtask of gene network inference. Integrating multiple sources of data is essential for correct identification of regulons and complete gene regulatory networks. Time series of expression data measured with microarrays or RNA-seq combined with static binding experiments (e.g., ChIP-seq) or literature mining may be used for inference of sigma factor regulatory networks. Results: We introduce Genexpi: a tool to identify sigma factors by combining candidates obtained from ChIP experiments or literature mining with time-course gene expression data. While Genexpi can be used to infer other types of regulatory interactions, it was designed and validated on real biological data from bacterial regulons. In this paper, we put primary focus on CyGenexpi: a plugin integrating Genexpi with the Cytoscape software for ease of use. As a part of this effort, a plugin for handling time series data in Cytoscape called CyDataseries has been developed and made available. Genexpi is also available as a standalone command line tool and an R package. Conclusions: Genexpi is a useful part of gene network inference toolbox. It provides meaningful information about the composition of regulons and delivers biologically interpretable results. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: RNA sequencing has become a ubiquitous technology used throughout life sciences as an effective method of measuring RNA abundance quantitatively in tissues and cells. The increase in use of RNA-seq technology has led to the continuous development of new tools for every step of analysis from alignment to downstream pathway analysis. However, effectively using these analysis tools in a scalable and reproducible way can be challenging, especially for non-experts. Results: Using the workflow management system Snakemake we have developed a user friendly, fast, efficient, and comprehensive pipeline for RNA-seq analysis. VIPER (Visualization Pipeline for RNA-seq analysis) is an analysis workflow that combines some of the most popular tools to take RNA-seq analysis from raw sequencing data, through alignment and quality control, into downstream differential expression and pathway analysis. VIPER has been created in a modular fashion to allow for the rapid incorporation of new tools to expand the capabilities. This capacity has already been exploited to include very recently developed tools that explore immune infiltrate and T-cell CDR (Complementarity-Determining Regions) reconstruction abilities. The pipeline has been conveniently packaged such that minimal computational skills are required to download and install the dozens of software packages that VIPER uses. Conclusions: VIPER is a comprehensive solution that performs most standard RNA-seq analyses quickly and effectively with a built-in capacity for customization and expansion. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Inference of gene regulatory network structures from RNA-Seq data is challenging due to the nature of the data, as measurements take the form of counts of reads mapped to a given gene. Here we present a model for RNA-Seq time series data that applies a negative binomial distribution for the observations, and uses sparse regression with a horseshoe prior to learn a dynamic Bayesian network of interactions between genes. We use a variational inference scheme to learn approximate posterior distributions for the model parameters. Results: The methodology is benchmarked on synthetic data designed to replicate the distribution of real world RNA-Seq data. We compare our method to other sparse regression approaches and find improved performance in learning directed networks. We demonstrate an application of our method to a publicly available human neuronal stem cell differentiation RNA-Seq time series data set to infer the underlying network structure. Conclusions: Our method is able to improve performance on synthetic data by explicitly modelling the statistical distribution of the data when learning networks from RNA-Seq time series. Applying approximate inference techniques we can learn network structures quickly with only moderate computing resources. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Morphine tolerance is a challenging clinical problem that limits the use of morphine in pain treatment, but the mechanisms of morphine tolerance remain unclear. Recent research indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) might be a novel and promising target in the pathogeneses of diseases. Therefore, we hypothesized that lncRNAs might play a role in the development of morphine tolerance. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were intrathecally injected with 10 μg morphine twice daily for 7 consecutive days. The animals were then sacrificed for lncRNA microarray tests, and the results were validated by RT-qPCR. Next, functional predictions for the differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were made with the Gene Ontology/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (GO/KEGG), and predictions for the differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) were made based on competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) analyses. The rats successfully developed morphine tolerance. LncRNA microarray analysis revealed that, according to the criteria of a log2 (fold change) > 1.5 and a P-value < 0.05, 136 lncRNAs and 278 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the morphine tolerance group (MT) compared with the normal saline group (NS). The functions of the DEmRNAs likely involve in the processes of the ion channel transport, pain transmission and immune response. The ceRNA analysis indicated that several possible interacting networks existed, including (MRAK150340, MRAK161211)/miR-219b/Tollip.Further annotations of the potential target mRNAs of the miRNAs according to the gene database suggested that the possible functions of these mRNAs primarily involved the regulation of ubiquitylation, G protein-linked receptors, and Toll-like receptors, which play roles in the development of morphine tolerance. Our findings revealed the profiles of differentially expressed lncRNAs in morphine tolerance conditions, and among these lncRNAs, some DElncRNAs might be new therapeutic targets for morphine tolerance. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Small GTPases (sGTPases) are critical switch-like regulators that mediate several important cellular functions and are often mutated in human cancers. They are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which specifically catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP. GEFs coordinate signaling networks in normal cells, and are frequently deregulated in cancers. sGTPase signaling pathways are complex and interconnected however, most GEF assays do not reveal such complexity. In this Communication, we describe the development of a unique real-time NMR-based multiplexed GEF assay that employs distinct isotopic labeling schemes for each sGTPase protein to enable simultaneous observation of six proteins of interest. We monitor nucleotide exchange of KRas, Rheb, RalB, RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1 in a single system, and assayed the activities of GEFs in lysates of cultured human cells and 3D organoids derived from pancreatic cancer patients. We observed potent activation of RhoA by lysates of HEK293a cells transfected with GEF-H1, along with weak stimulation of Rac1, which we showed is indirect. Our functional analyses of pancreatic cancer-derived organoids revealed higher GEF activity for RhoA than other sGTPases, in line with RNA-seq data indicating high expression of RhoA-specific GEFs. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fatty acids metabolic products determine meat quality in chickens. Identifying genes associated with fatty acids composition could provide valuable information for the complex genetic networks of genes with underlying variations in fatty acids synthesis. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted to explore the chicken transcriptome from the thigh muscle tissue of 6 Huangshan Black Chickens with 3 extremely high and low phenotypic values for percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In total, we obtained 41,139,108–44,901,729 uniquely mapped reads, which covered 74.15% of the current annotated transcripts including 18964 mRNA transcripts, across all the six thigh muscle tissue samples. Of these, we revealed 274 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a highly significant correlation with polyunsaturated fatty acids percentage between the comparison groups based on the ratio of PUFA/SFA. Gene ontology and pathway analysis indicated that the DEGs were enriched in particular biological processes affecting fatty acids metabolism, biosynthe-sis of unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs), and cell junction-related pathways. Integrated interpretation of differential gene expression and formerly reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) demonstrated that FADS2, DCN, FRZB, OGN, PRKAG3, LHFP, CHCHD10, CYTL1, FBLN5, and ADGRD1 are the most promising candidate genes affecting polyunsaturated fatty acids percentage. © 2018 Yang et al.

AB  - Motivation Many repetitive DNA elements are transcribed at appreciable expression levels. Mapping the corresponding RNA sequencing reads back to a reference genome is notoriously difficult and error-prone task, however. This is in particular true if chemical modifications introduce systematic mismatches, while at the same time the genomic loci are only approximately identical, as in the case of tRNAs. Results We therefore developed a dedicated mapping strategy to handle RNA-seq reads that map to tRNAs relying on a modified target genome in which known tRNA loci are masked and instead intronless tRNA precursor sequences are appended as artificial â € chromosomes'. In a first pass, reads that overlap the boundaries of mature tRNAs are extracted. In the second pass, the remaining reads are mapped to a tRNA-masked target that is augmented by representative mature tRNA sequences. Using both simulated and real life data we show that our best-practice workflow removes most of the mapping artefacts introduced by simpler mapping schemes and makes it possible to reliably identify many of chemical tRNA modifications in generic small RNA-seq data. Using simulated data the FDR is only 2%. We find compelling evidence for tissue specific differences of tRNA modification patterns.

AB  - High-throughput RNA-seq has revolutionized the process of small RNA (sRNA) discovery, leading to a rapid expansion of sRNA categories. In addition to the previously well-characterized sRNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), recent emerging studies have spotlighted on tRNA-derived sRNAs (tsRNAs) and rRNA-derived sRNAs (rsRNAs) as new categories of sRNAs that bear versatile functions. Since existing software and pipelines for sRNA annotation are mostly focused on analyzing miRNAs or piRNAs, here we developed the sRNA annotation pipeline optimized for rRNA- and tRNA-derived sRNAs (SPORTS1.0). SPORTS1.0 is optimized for analyzing tsRNAs and rsRNAs from sRNA-seq data, in addition to its capacity to annotate canonical sRNAs such as miRNAs and piRNAs. Moreover, SPORTS1.0 can predict potential RNA modification sites based on nucleotide mismatches within sRNAs. SPORTS1.0 is precompiled to annotate sRNAs for a wide range of 68 species across bacteria, yeast, plant, and animal kingdoms, while additional species for analyses could be readily expanded upon end users’ input. For demonstration, by analyzing sRNA datasets using SPORTS1.0, we reveal that distinct signatures are present in tsRNAs and rsRNAs from different mouse cell types. We also find that compared to other sRNA species, tsRNAs bear the highest mismatch rate, which is consistent with their highly modified nature. SPORTS1.0 is an open-source software and can be publically accessed at https://github.com/junchaoshi/sports1.0. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Humans are a diploid species that inherit one set of chromosomes paternally and one homologous set of chromosomes maternally. Unfortunately, most human sequencing initiatives ignore this fact in that they do not directly delineate the nucleotide content of the maternal and paternal copies of the 23 chromosomes individuals possess (i.e., they do not ‘phase’ the genome) often because of the costs and complexities of doing so. We compared 11 different widely-used approaches to phasing human genomes using the publicly available ‘Genome-In-A-Bottle’ (GIAB) phased version of the NA12878 genome as a gold standard. The phasing strategies we compared included laboratory-based assays that prepare DNA in unique ways to facilitate phasing as well as purely computational approaches that seek to reconstruct phase information from general sequencing reads and constructs or population-level haplotype frequency information obtained through a reference panel of haplotypes. To assess the performance of the 11 approaches, we used metrics that included, among others, switch error rates, haplotype block lengths, the proportion of fully phase-resolved genes, phasing accuracy and yield between pairs of SNVs. Our comparisons suggest that a hybrid or combined approach that leverages: 1. population-based phasing using the SHAPEIT software suite, 2. either genome-wide sequencing read data or parental genotypes, and 3. a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies, provides a fast and efficient way to produce highly accurate phase-resolved individual human genomes. We found that for population-based approaches, phasing performance is enhanced with the addition of genome-wide read data; e.g., whole genome shotgun and/or RNA sequencing reads. Further, we found that the inclusion of parental genotype data within a population-based phasing strategy can provide as much as a ten-fold reduction in phasing errors. We also considered a majority voting scheme for the construction of a consensus haplotype combining multiple predictions for enhanced performance and site coverage. Finally, we also identified DNA sequence signatures associated with the genomic regions harboring phasing switch errors, which included regions of low polymorphism or SNV density. © 2018 Choi et al.

AB  - Although many insects are associated with obligate bacterial endosymbionts, the mechanisms by which these host/endosymbiont associations are regulated remain mysterious. While microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recently identified as regulators of host/microbe interactions, including host/pathogen and host/facultative endosymbiont interactions, the role miRNAs may play in mediating host/obligate endosymbiont interactions is virtually unknown. Here, we identified conserved miRNAs that potentially mediate symbiotic interactions between aphids and their obligate endosymbiont, Buchnera aphidicola. Using small RNA sequence data from Myzus persicae and Acyrthosiphon pisum, we annotated 93 M. persicae and 89 A. pisum miRNAs, among which 69 were shared. We found 14 miRNAs that were either highly expressed in aphid bacteriome, the Buchnera-housing tissue, or differentially expressed in bacteriome vs. gut, a non-Buchnera-housing tissue. Strikingly, 10 of these 14 miRNAs have been implicated previously in other host/microbe interaction studies. Investigating the interaction networks of these miRNAs using a custom computational pipeline, we identified 103 miRNA::mRNA interactions shared between M. persicae and A. pisum. Functional annotation of the shared mRNA targets revealed only two over-represented cluster of orthologous group categories: amino acid transport and metabolism, and signal transduction mechanisms. Our work supports a role for miRNAs in mediating host/symbiont interactions between aphids and their obligate endosymbiont Buchnera. In addition, our results highlight the probable importance of signal transduction mechanisms to host/endosymbiont coevolution. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a dominantly inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by expression of mutant myotonin-protein kinase (DMPK) transcripts containing expanded CUG repeats. Pathogenic DMPK RNA sequesters the muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins, causing alterations in metabolism of various RNAs. Cardiac dysfunction represents the second most common cause of death in DM type 1 (DM1) patients. However, the contribution of MBNL sequestration in DM1 cardiac dysfunction is unclear. We overexpressed Muscleblind (Mbl), the Drosophila MBNL orthologue, in cardiomyocytes of DM1 model flies and observed a rescue of heart dysfunctions, which are characteristic of these model flies and resemble cardiac defects observed in patients. We also identified a drug-daunorubicin hydrochloride-that directly binds to CUG repeats and alleviates Mbl sequestration in Drosophila DM1 cardiomyocytes, resulting in missplicing rescue and cardiac function recovery. These results demonstrate the relevance of Mbl sequestration caused by expanded-CUG-repeat RNA in cardiac dysfunctions in DM1, and highlight the potential of strategies aimed at inhibiting this protein-RNA interaction to recover normal cardiac function. © 2018.

AB  - Genetic data analysis of large numbers of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), exome chips, and whole exome (WES) or whole-genome (WGS) sequencing data, requires well defined processing steps. As a result, several freely available analytic toolkits have been developed to streamline these processes. Among these, PLINK is the most comprehensive in terms of its quality control and analytic modules, although its focus remains on SNVs. PLINK fulfills two analytic needs-aiding the process of performing quality control (QC) on large data sets and providing basic statistical tools to analyze the variants in genetic models. The current version of PLINK (v1.90b) has incorporated several sophisticated statistical modeling features, such as those that were introduced by GCTA (genome-wide complex trait analysis), including mixed-model association analysis and cluster-based algorithms. Although PLINK is diverse in its applicability to data management and analysis, in some instances, other available tools offer more optimal options. Here we provide a practical overview of major PLINK features with respect to QC, data management, and association mapping, along with learned shortcuts and limitations to be considered. In cases where PLINK features are limited, we provide alternative approaches using additional freely available pipelines. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Any single nucleotide variant detection study could benefit from a fast and cheap method of measuring the quality of variant call list. It is advantageous to be able to see how the call list quality is affected by different variant filtering thresholds and other adjustments to the study parameters. Here we look into a possibility of estimating the proportion of true positives in a single nucleotide variant call list for human data. Using whole-exome and whole-genome gold standard data sets for training, we focus on building a generic model that only relies on information available from any variant caller. We assess and compare the performance of different candidate models based on their practical accuracy. We find that the generic model delivers decent accuracy most of the time. Further, we conclude that its performance could be improved substantially by leveraging the variant quality metrics that are specific to each variant calling tool. © 2018 Nik Tuzov.

AB  - Background: The presentation of HLA peptide complexes to T cells is a highly regulated and tissue specific process involving multiple transcriptionally controlled cellular components. The extensive polymorphism of HLA genes and the complex composition of the proteasome make it difficult to map their expression profiles across tissues. Methods: Here we applied a tailored gene quantification pipeline to 4323 publicly available RNA-Seq datasets representing 55 normal tissues and cell types to examine expression profiles of (classical and non-classical) HLA class I, class II and proteasomal genes. Results: We generated the first comprehensive expression atlas of antigen presenting-related genes across 56 normal tissues and cell types, including immune cells, pancreatic islets, platelets and hematopoietic stem cells. We found a surprisingly heterogeneous HLA expression pattern with up to 100-fold difference in intra-tissue median HLA abundances. Cells of the immune system and lymphatic organs expressed the highest levels of classical HLA class I (HLA-A,-B,-C), class II (HLA-DQA1,-DQB1,-DPA1,-DPB1,-DRA,-DRB1) and non-classical HLA class I (HLA-E,-F) molecules, whereas retina, brain, muscle, megakaryocytes and erythroblasts showed the lowest abundance. In contrast, we identified a distinct and highly tissue-restricted expression pattern of the non-classical class I gene HLA-G in placenta, pancreatic islets, pituitary gland and testis. While the constitutive proteasome showed relatively constant expression across all tissues, we found the immunoproteasome to be enriched in lymphatic organs and almost absent in immune privileged tissues. Conclusions: Here, we not only provide a reference catalog of tissue and cell type specific HLA expression, but also highlight extremely variable expression of the basic components of antigen processing and presentation in different cell types. Our findings indicate that low expression of classical HLA class I molecules together with lack of immunoproteasome components as well as upregulation of HLA-G may be of key relevance to maintain tolerance in immune privileged tissues. © 2018 The Author(s).

BALDR was accurate for clonotype identification in human and rhesus macaque influenza vaccine and simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine induced vaccine-induced plasmablasts and naïve and antigen-specific memory B cells. BALDR enables matching of clonotype identity with single-cell transcriptional information in B cell lineages and will have broad application in the fields of vaccines, human immunodeficiency virus broadly neutralizing antibody development, and cancer.

AB  - Background: Ginseng is a popular traditional herbal medicine in north-eastern Asia. It has been used for human health for over thousands of years. With the rise in global temperature, the production of Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A.Meyer) in Korea have migrated from mid to northern parts of the Korean peninsula to escape from the various higher temperature related stresses. Under the high ambient temperature, vegetative growth was accelerated, which resulted in early flowering. This precocious phase change led to yield loss. Despite of its importance as a traditional medicine, biological mechanisms of ginseng has not been well studied and even the genome sequence of ginseng is yet to be determined due to its complex genome structure. Thus, it is challenging to investigate the molecular biology mechanisms at the transcript level. Results: To investigate how ginseng responds to the high ambient temperature environment, we performed high throughput RNA sequencing and implemented a bioinformatics pipeline for the integrated analysis of small-RNA and mRNA-seq data without a reference genome. By performing reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR and sanger sequencing of transcripts that were assembled using our pipeline, we validated that their sequences were expressed in our samples. Furthermore, to investigate the interaction between genes and non-coding small RNAs and their regulation status under the high ambient temperature, we identified potential gene regulatory miRNAs. As a result, 100,672 contigs with significant expression level were identified and 6 known, 214 conserved and 60 potential novel miRNAs were predicted to be expressed under the high ambient temperature. Conclusion: Collectively, we have found that development, flowering and temperature responsive genes were induced under high ambient temperature, whereas photosynthesis related genes were repressed. Functional miRNAs were down-regulated under the high ambient temperature. Among them are miR156 and miR396 that target flowering (SPL6/9) and growth regulating genes (GRF) respectively. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: With the rapid advancement of array-based genotyping techniques, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with common complex diseases. However, it has been shown that only a small proportion of the genetic etiology of complex diseases could be explained by the genetic factors identified from GWAS. This missing heritability could possibly be explained by gene-gene interaction (epistasis) and rare variants. There has been an exponential growth of gene-gene interaction analysis for common variants in terms of methodological developments and practical applications. Also, the recent advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies makes it possible to conduct rare variant analysis. However, little progress has been made in gene-gene interaction analysis for rare variants. Results: Here, we propose GxGrare which is a new gene-gene interaction method for the rare variants in the framework of the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis. The proposed method consists of three steps; 1) collapsing the rare variants, 2) MDR analysis for the collapsed rare variants, and 3) detect top candidate interaction pairs. GxGrare can be used for the detection of not only gene-gene interactions, but also interactions within a single gene. The proposed method is illustrated with 1080 whole exome sequencing data of the Korean population in order to identify causal gene-gene interaction for rare variants for type 2 diabetes. Conclusion: The proposed GxGrare performs well for gene-gene interaction detection with collapsing of rare variants. GxGrare is available at http://bibs.snu.ac.kr/software/gxgrarewhich contains simulation data and documentation. Supported operating systems include Linux and OS X. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The development of high-throughput experimental technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, have led to new challenges for handling, analyzing and integrating the resulting large and diverse datasets. Bioinformatical analysis of these data commonly requires a number of mutually dependent steps applied to numerous samples for multiple conditions and replicates. To support these analyses, a number of workflow management systems (WMSs) have been developed to allow automated execution of corresponding analysis workflows. Major advantages of WMSs are the easy reproducibility of results as well as the reusability of workflows or their components. Results: In this article, we present Watchdog, a WMS for the automated analysis of large-scale experimental data. Main features include straightforward processing of replicate data, support for distributed computer systems, customizable error detection and manual intervention into workflow execution. Watchdog is implemented in Java and thus platform-independent and allows easy sharing of workflows and corresponding program modules. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for workflow construction using pre-defined modules as well as a helper script for creating new module definitions. Execution of workflows is possible using either the GUI or a command-line interface and a web-interface is provided for monitoring the execution status and intervening in case of errors. To illustrate its potentials on a real-life example, a comprehensive workflow and modules for the analysis of RNA-seq experiments were implemented and are provided with the software in addition to simple test examples. Conclusions:Watchdog is a powerful and flexible WMS for the analysis of large-scale high-throughput experiments. We believe it will greatly benefit both users with and without programming skills who want to develop and apply bioinformatical workflows with reasonable overhead.

AB  - Background: With the recent proliferation of single-cell RNA-Seq experiments, several methods have been developed for unsupervised analysis of the resulting datasets. These methods often rely on unintuitive hyperparameters and do not explicitly address the subjectivity associated with clustering. Results: In this work, we present DendroSplit, an interpretable framework for analyzing single-cell RNA-Seq datasets that addresses both the clustering interpretability and clustering subjectivity issues. DendroSplit offers a novel perspective on the single-cell RNA-Seq clustering problem motivated by the definition of "cell type", allowing us to cluster using feature selection to uncover multiple levels of biologically meaningful populations in the data. We analyze several landmark single-cell datasets, demonstrating both the method's efficacy and computational efficiency. Conclusion: DendroSplit offers a clustering framework that is comparable to existing methods in terms of accuracy and speed but is novel in its emphasis on interpretabilty.

AB  - Non-coding RNA is an interesting class of gene regulators with diverse functionalities. One large subgroup of non-coding RNAs is the recently discovered class of circular RNAs (circRNAs). CircRNAs are conserved and expressed in a tissue and developmental specific manner, although for the vast majority, the functional relevance remains unclear. To identify and quantify circRNAs expression, several bioinformatic pipelines have been developed to assess the catalog of circRNAs in any given total RNA sequencing dataset. We recently compared five different algorithms for circRNA detection, but here this analysis is extended to 11 algorithms. By comparing the number of circRNAs discovered and their respective sensitivity to RNaseR digestion, the sensitivity and specificity of each algorithm are evaluated. Moreover, the ability to predict de novo circRNA, i.e., circRNAs not derived from annotated splice sites, is also determined as well as the effect of eliminating low quality and adaptor-containing reads prior to circRNA prediction. Finally, and most importantly, all possible pair-wise combinations of algorithms are tested and guidelines for algorithm complementarity are provided. Conclusively, the algorithms mostly agree on highly expressed circRNAs, however, in many cases, algorithm-specific false positives with high read counts are predicted, which is resolved by using the shared output from two (or more) algorithms. © 2018 Hansen.

AB  - Differential gene expression testing is an analysis commonly applied to RNA-Seq data. These statistical tests identify genes that are significantly different across phenotypes. We extend this testing paradigm to multivariate gene interactions from a classification perspective with the goal to detect novel gene interactions for the phenotypes of interest. This is achieved through our novel computational framework comprised of a hierarchical statistical model of the RNA-Seq processing pipeline and the corresponding optimal Bayesian classifier. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and Monte Carlo integration, we compute quantities where no analytical formulation exists. The performance is then illustrated on an expression dataset from a dietary intervention study where we identify gene pairs that have low classification error yet were not identified as differentially expressed. Additionally, we have released the software package to perform OBC classification on RNA-Seq data under an open source license and is available at http://bit.ly/obc-package. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Heat stress (HS) causes detrimental effects on plant morphology, physiology, and biochemistry that lead to drastic reduction in plant biomass production and economic yield worldwide. To date, little is known about HS-responsive genes involved in thermotolerance mechanism in radish. In this study, a total of 6600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the control and Heat24 cDNA libraries of radish were isolated by high-throughput sequencing. With Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, some genes including MAPK, DREB, ERF, AP2, GST, Hsf, and Hsp were predominantly assigned in signal transductions, metabolic pathways, and biosynthesis and abiotic stress-responsive pathways. These pathways played significant roles in reducing stress-induced damages and enhancing heat tolerance in radish. Expression patterns of 24 candidate genes were validated by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Based mainly on the analysis of DEGs combining with the previous miRNAs analysis, the schematic model of HS-responsive regulatory network was proposed. To counter the effects of HS, a rapid response of the plasma membrane leads to the opening of specific calcium channels and cytoskeletal reorganization, after which HS-responsive genes are activated to repair damaged proteins and ultimately facilitate further enhancement of thermotolerance in radish. These results could provide fundamental insight into the regulatory network underlying heat tolerance in radish and facilitate further genetic manipulation of thermotolerance in root vegetable crops. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The current classification of melanocytic tumors includes clinical, pathological, and molecular data. A subset of lesions remains difficult to classify according to these complex multilayer schemes. We report two cases of deeply infiltrating melanomas with a sclerosing background. The first case occurred on the back of a middle-aged man appearing clinically as a dermatofibroma. The architectural and cytological aspects resembled those of a desmoplastic melanoma but the strong expression of both melanA and HMB45, two stainings usually reported as negative in this entity, raised the question of an alternate diagnosis. The second case was a large, slowly growing, perivulvar tumor in a middle-aged woman. The morphology was complex with a central junctional spitzoid pattern associating an epidermal hyperplasia with large nests of large spindled melanocytes. The dermal component was made of deeply invasive strands and nests of nevoid unpigmented melanocytes surrounded by fibrosis; a perineural invasion was present at the periphery of the lesion. In both cases, aCGH found, among many other anomalies, a chromosomal breakpoint at the BRAF locus. RNA sequencing identified in both an AKAP9-BRAF gene fusion. A complementary resection was performed and no relapses have been observed in the respectively 15 and 6 months of follow-up. Both of these melanomas remained unclassified. We further review the variety of melanocytic tumors associated with such BRAF fusions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs. At the core is a new semi-automatic algorithm SARNAclust, the first unsupervised method to identify and deconvolve multiple sequence/structure motifs simultaneously. SARNAclust computes similarity between sequence/structure objects using a graph kernel, providing the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. Application of SARNAclust to synthetic data shows its capability of clustering 5 motifs at once with a V-measure value of over 0.95, while GraphClust achieves only a V-measure of 0.083 and RNAcontext cannot detect any of the motifs. When applied to existing eCLIP sets, SARNAclust finds known motifs for SLBP and HNRNPC and novel motifs for several other RBPs such as AGGF1, AKAP8L and ILF3. We demonstrate an experimental validation protocol, a targeted Bind-n-Seq-like high-throughput sequencing approach that relies on RNA inverse folding for oligo pool design, that can validate the components within the SLBP motif. Finally, we use this protocol to experimentally interrogate the SARNAclust motif predictions for protein ILF3. Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC. © 2018 Dotu et al.

AB  - Objective: Reliable biomarkers associated with aggressiveness of non-functioning gonadotroph adenomas (GAs) are lacking. As the growth of tumor remnants is highly variable, molecular markers for growth potential prediction are necessary. We hypothesized that fast- and slow-growing GAs present different gene expression profiles and reliable biomarkers for tumor growth potential could be identified, focusing on the specific role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Design and methods: Eight GAs selected for RNA sequencing were equally divided into fast- and slow-growing group by the tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) median (27.75 months). Data were analyzed by tophat2, cufflinks and cummeRbund pipeline. 40 genes were selected for RT-qPCR validation in 20 GAs based on significance, fold-change and pathway analyses. The effect of silencing MTDH (metadherin) and EMCN (endomucin) on in vitro migration of human adenoma cells was evaluated. Results: 350 genes were significantly differentially expressed (282 genes upregulated and 68 downregulated in the fast group, P-adjusted <0.05). Among 40 selected genes, 11 showed associations with TVDT (−0.669<R<−0.46, P<0.05). These were PCDH18, UNC5D, EMCN, MYO1B, GPM6A and six EMT-related genes (SPAG9, SKIL, MTDH, HOOK1, CNOT6L and PRKACB). MTDH, but not EMCN, demonstrated involvement in cell migration and association with EMT markers. Conclusions: Fast- and slow-growing GAs present different gene expression profiles, and genes related to EMT have higher expression in fast-growing tumors. In addition to MTDH, identified as an important contributor to aggressiveness, the other genes might represent markers for tumor growth potential and possible targets for drug therapy. © 2018 European Society of Endocrinology.

AB  - Proteogenomics methods have identified many non-annotated protein-coding genes in the human genome. Many of the newly discovered protein-coding genes encode peptides and small proteins, referred to collectively as microproteins. Microproteins are produced through ribosome translation of small open reading frames (smORFs). The discovery of many smORFs reveals a blind spot in traditional gene-finding algorithms for these genes. Biological studies have found roles for microproteins in cell biology and physiology, and the potential that there exists additional bioactive microproteins drives the interest in detection and discovery of these molecules. A key step in any proteogenomics workflow is the assembly of RNA-Seq data into likely mRNA transcripts that are then used to create a searchable protein database. Here we demonstrate that specific features of the assembled transcriptome impact microprotein detection by shotgun proteomics. By tailoring transcript assembly for downstream mass spectrometry searching, we show that we can detect more than double the number of high-quality microprotein candidates and introduce a novel open-source mRNA assembler for proteogenomics (MAPS) that incorporates all of these features. By integrating our specialized assembler, MAPS, and a popular generalized assembler into our proteogenomics pipeline, we detect 45 novel human microproteins from a high quality proteogenomics dataset of a human cell line. We then characterize the features of the novel microproteins, identifying two classes of microproteins. Our work highlights the importance of specialized transcriptome assembly upstream of proteomics validation when searching for short and potentially rare and poorly conserved proteins. © 2018 Ma et al.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) serve a role as important regulators in cardiac hypertrophy. The present study aimed to reveal the differential expression profile of miRNAs between young and aging spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and studied the functional annotation of predicted targets. Briefly, 3-month-old and 12-month-old SHRs (n=3/group) were subjected to echocardiography, histopathological analysis and dihydroethidium staining. Subsequently, small RNA sequencing and data processing was conducted to identify the differentially expressed miRNAs between these two groups. Eight significantly upregulated miRNAs were validated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), followed by in silico target gene prediction. Functional annotation analysis of the predicted targets was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. As a result, significantly impaired left ventricular diastolic function was detected in the 12-month-old SHRs, alongside increased myocyte cross-sectional area and percentage area of fibrosis, elevated reactive oxygen species production and reduced microvessel density (P<0.05). Compared with the 3-month-old SHRs, 21 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and five miRNAs were downregulated in 12-month-old rats (P<0.05). Eight upregulated, remodeling-associated miRNAs, including rno-miR-132-3p, rno-miR-182, rno-miR-208b-3p, rno-miR-212-3p, rno-miR-214-3p, rno-miR-218a-5p, rno-miR-221-3p and rno-miR-222-3p, underwent bioinformatics analysis. The target genes were significantly enriched in 688 GO terms and 39 KEGG pathways, including regulation of peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, ErbB signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway, insulin secretion, adipocytokine signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway. Collectively, the present study identified a dysregulated miRNA profile in aging SHRs, which targeted numerous signaling pathways associated with cardiac hypertrophy, autophagy, insulin metabolism, angiogenesis and inflammatory response.

AB  - Recent advances in culture-free microbiological techniques bring new understanding of the role of intestinal microbiota in heath and performance. Intestinal microbial communities in chickens assume a near-stable state within the week which leaves a very small window for permanent microbiota remodelling. It is the first colonisers that determine the fate of microbial community in humans and birds alike, and after the microbiota has matured there are very small odds for permanent modification as stable community resists change. In this study we inoculated broiler chicks immediately post hatch, with 3 species of Lactobacillus, identified by sequencing of 16S rRNA and pheS genes as L. ingluviei, L. agilis and L. reuteri. The strains were isolated from the gut of healthy chickens as reproducibly persistent Lactobacillus strains among multiple flocks. Birds inoculated with the probiotic mix reached significantly higher weight by 28 days of age. Although each strain was able to colonise when administered alone, administering the probiotic mix at-hatch resulted in colonisation by only L. ingluviei. High initial abundance of L. ingluviei was slowly reducing, however, the effects of at-hatch administration of the Lactobacillus mix on modifying microbiota development and structure remained persistent. There was a tendency of promotion of beneficial and reduction in pathogenic taxa in the probiotic administered group. © 2018 Baldwin et al.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular testing for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) fusion is routinely performed in patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma to assess their eligibility for targeted therapy. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)-derived material frequently is the only pathologic material available. The identification of genomic aberrations in thyroid nodules from FNA smears may help stratify cancer risk and spare patients from a second surgery. In the current study, the authors tested nucleic acid extracted from the cytology smears of lung and thyroid carcinomas for simultaneous detection of single-nucleotide variant, insertion/deletion, and gene fusion using an RNA-based next-generation sequencing assay. METHODS: A total of 27 cases (17 lung and 10 thyroid carcinomas, the majority of which had known variants) were tested. Areas of interest were scrapped from stained smears using a scalpel. Total nucleic acid was extracted. Gene fusion and mutational analysis was performed using the Comprehensive Thyroid and Lung FusionPlex Assay. Data were analyzed using the analysis pipeline provided by the vendor. Eleven cases with available formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue were tested in parallel. RESULTS: Gene fusions were detected in 6 cases; common single-nucleotide variants in EGFR, RAS, and BRAF in 14 cases; and in-frame deletions within EGFR in 3 cases. A concordance rate of 100% was observed between FNA and FFPE tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Cytology preparations can be a reliable source for the detection of both DNA and RNA aberrations. The ability to simultaneously detect multiple types of genomic variants is crucial for patients with advanced cancer and maximizes the usefulness of cytology specimens.

AB  - Dysregulation of splicing is a common factor underlying many inherited diseases including deafness. For one deafness-associated gene, DFNA5, perturbation of exon 8 splicing results in a constitutively active truncated protein. To date, only intronic mutations have been reported to cause exon 8 skipping in patients with DFNA5-related deafness. In five families with postlingual progressive autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss, we employed two next-generation sequencing platforms—OtoSCOPE and whole exome sequencing—followed by variant filtering and prioritization based on both minor allele frequency and functional consequence using a customized bioinformatics pipeline to identify three novel and two recurrent mutations in DFNA5 that segregated with hearing loss in these families. The three novel mutations are all missense variants within exon 8 that are predicted computationally to decrease splicing efficiency or abolish it completely. We confirmed their functional impact in vitro using mini-genes carrying each mutant DFNA5 exon 8. In so doing, we present the first exonic mutations in DFNA5 to cause deafness, expand the mutational spectrum of DFNA5-related hearing loss, and highlight the importance of assessing the effect of coding variants on splicing. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Expanded mutation detection and novel gene discovery for isolated polycystic liver disease (PCLD) are necessary as 50% of cases do not have identified mutations in the seven published disease genes. We investigated a family with five affected siblings for which no loss-of-function variants were identified by whole exome sequencing analysis. SNP genotyping and linkage analysis narrowed the candidate regions to ∼8% of the genome, which included two published PCLD genes in close proximity to each other, GANAB and LRP5. Based on these findings, we re-evaluated the exome sequencing data and identified a novel intronic nine base pair deletion in the vicinity of the GANAB exon 24 splice donor that had initially been discarded by the sequence analysis pipelines. We used a minigene assay to show that this deletion leads to skipping of exon 24 in cell lines and primary human cholangiocytes. These findings prompt genomic evaluation beyond the coding region to enhance mutation detection in PCLD and to avoid premature implication of other genes in linkage disequilibrium. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare and heterogeneous genetic syndrome. It is associated with short stature, bone marrow failure, high predisposition to cancer, microcephaly and congenital malformation. Many genes have been associated with FA. Previously, two adult patients with biallelic pathogenic variant in Breast Cancer 1 gene (BRCA1) had been identified in Fanconi Anemia-like condition. Clinical report The proband was a 2.5 year-old girl with severe short stature, microcephaly, neurodevelopmental delay, congenital heart disease and dysmorphic features. Her parents were third degree cousins. Routine screening tests for short stature was normal. Methods We conducted whole exome sequencing (WES) of the proband and used an analysis pipeline to identify rare nonsynonymous genetic variants that cause short stature. Results We identified a homozygous loss-of-function BRCA1 mutation (c.2709T > A; p. Cys903*), which promotes the loss of critical domains of the protein. Cytogenetic study with DEB showed an increased chromosomal breakage. We screened heterozygous parents of the index case for cancer and we detected, in her mother, a metastatic adenocarcinoma in an axillar lymph node with probable primary site in the breast. Conclusion It is possible to consolidate the FA-like phenotype associated with biallelic loss-of-function BRCA1, characterized by microcephaly, short stature, developmental delay, dysmorphic face features and cancer predisposition. In our case, the WES allowed to establish the genetic cause of short stature in the context of a chromosome instability syndrome. An identification of BRCA1 mutations in our patient allowed precise genetic counseling and also triggered cancer screening for the patient and her family members. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Gap junction transmembrane channels allow the transfer of small molecules between the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. They are formed by proteins named connexins (Cxs) that have long been considered as a tumor suppressor. This widespread view has been challenged by recent studies suggesting that the role of Connexin 43 (Cx43) in cancer is tissue- and stage-specific and can even promote tumor progression. High throughput profiling of invasive breast cancer has allowed for the construction of subtyping schemes that partition patients into at least four distinct intrinsic subtypes. This study characterizes Cx43 expression during cancer progression with each of the tumor subtypes using a compendium of publicly available gene expression data. In particular, we show that Cx43 expression depends greatly on intrinsic subtype. Tumor grade also co-varies with patient subtype, resulting in Cx43 co-expression with grade in a subtype-dependent manner. Better survival was associated with a high expression of Cx43 in unstratified and luminal tumors but with a low expression in Her2e subtype. A better understanding of Cx43 regulation in a subtype-dependent manner is needed to clarify the context in which Cx43 is associated with tumor suppression or cancer progression. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - New de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation methods provide an incredible opportunity to study the transcriptome of organisms that lack an assembled and annotated genome. There are currently a number of de novo transcriptome assembly methods, but it has been difficult to evaluate the quality of these assemblies. In order to assess the quality of the transcriptome assemblies, we composed a workflow of multiple quality check measurements that in combination provide a clear evaluation of the assembly performance. We presented novel transcriptome assemblies and functional annotations for Pacific Whiteleg Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei ), a mariculture species with great national and international interest, and no solid transcriptome/genome reference. We examined Pacific Whiteleg transcriptome assemblies via multiple metrics, and provide an improved gene annotation. Our investigations show that assessing the quality of an assembly purely based on the assembler's statistical measurements can be misleading; we propose a hybrid approach that consists of statistical quality checks and further biological-based evaluations. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Whole exome sequencing (WES) has made the identification of causative SNVs/InDels associated with rare Mendelian conditions increasingly accessible. Incorporation of softwares allowing CNVs detection into the WES bioinformatics pipelines may increase the diagnostic yield. However, no standard protocols for this analysis are so far available and CNVs in non-coding regions are totally missed by WES, in spite of their possible role in the regulation of the flanking genes expression. So, in a number of cases the diagnostic workflow contemplates an initial investigation by genomic arrays followed, in the negative cases, by WES. The opposite workflow may also be applied, according to the familial segregation of the disease. We show preliminary results for a diagnostic application of a single next generation sequencing panel permitting the concurrent detection of LOH and variations in sequences and copy number. This approach allowed us to highlight compound heterozygosity for a CNV and a sequence variant in a number of cases, the duplication of a non-coding region responsible for sex reversal, and a whole-chromosome isodisomy causing reduction to homozygosity for a WFS1 variant. Moreover, the panel enabled us to detect deletions, duplications, and amplifications with sensitivity comparable to that of the most widely used array-CGH platforms. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Amongst the echinoderms the class Ophiuroidea is of particular interest for its phylogenetic position, ecological importance and developmental and regenerative biology. However, compared to other echinoderms, notably echinoids (sea urchins), relatively little is known about developmental changes in gene expression in ophiuroids. To address this issue, we have generated and assembled a large RNAseq data set of four key stages of development in the brittle star Amphiura filiformis and a de novo reference transcriptome of comparable quality to that of a model echinoderm-the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Furthermore, we provide access to the new data via a web interface: http://www.echinonet.eu/shiny/Amphiura_filiformis/. Results: We have identified highly conserved genes associated with the development of a biomineralised skeleton. We also identify important class-specific characters, including the independent duplication of the msp130 class of genes in different echinoderm classes and the unique occurrence of spicule matrix (sm) genes in echinoids. Using a new quantification pipeline for our de novo transcriptome, validated with other methodologies, we find major differences between brittle stars and sea urchins in the temporal expression of many transcription factor genes. This divergence in developmental regulatory states is more evident in early stages of development when cell specification begins, rather than when cells initiate differentiation. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that there has been a high degree of gene regulatory network rewiring and clade-specific gene duplication, supporting the hypothesis of a convergent evolution of larval skeleton development in echinoderms. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: MYO15A variants, except those in the N-terminal domain, have been shown to be associated with congenital or pre-lingual severe-to-profound hearing loss (DFNB3), which ultimately requires cochlear implantation in early childhood. Recently, such variants have also been shown to possibly cause moderate-to-severe hearing loss. Herein, we also demonstrate that some MYO15A mutant alleles can cause postlingual onset of progressive partial deafness. Methods: Two multiplex Korean families (SB246 and SB224), manifesting postlingual, progressive, partial deafness in an autosomal recessive fashion, were recruited. Molecular genetics testing was performed in two different pipelines, in a parallel fashion, for the SB246 family: targeted exome sequencing (TES) of 129 known deafness genes from the proband and whole exome sequencing (WES) of all affected subjects. Only the former pipeline was performed for the SB224 family. Rigorous bioinformatics analyses encompassing structural variations were executed to investigate any causative variants. Results: In the SB246 family, two different molecular diagnostic pipelines provided exactly the same candidate variants: c.5504G>A (p.R1835H) in the motor domain and c.10245_10247delCTC (p.S3417del) in the FERM domain of MYO15A. In the SB224 family, c.9790C>T (p.Q3264X) and c.10263C>G (p.I3421M) in the FERM domain were detected as candidate variants. Conclusions: Some recessive MYO15A variants can cause postlingual onset of progressive partial deafness. The phenotypic spectrum of DFNB3 should be extended to include such partial deafness. The mechanism for a milder phenotype could be due to the milder pathogenic potential from hypomorphic alleles of MYO15A or the presence of modifier genes. This merits further investigation. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Dropout events in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) cause many transcripts to go undetected and induce an excess of zero read counts, leading to power issues in differential expression (DE) analysis. This has triggered the development of bespoke scRNA-seq DE methods to cope with zero inflation. Recent evaluations, however, have shown that dedicated scRNA-seq tools provide no advantage compared to traditional bulk RNA-seq tools. We introduce a weighting strategy, based on a zero-inflated negative binomial model, that identifies excess zero counts and generates gene- and cell-specific weights to unlock bulk RNA-seq DE pipelines for zero-inflated data, boosting performance for scRNA-seq. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies are poised to reshape the current cell-type classification system. However, a transcriptome-based single-cell atlas has not been achieved for complex mammalian systems. Here, we developed Microwell-seq, a high-throughput and low-cost scRNA-seq platform using simple, inexpensive devices. Using Microwell-seq, we analyzed more than 400,000 single cells covering all of the major mouse organs and constructed a basic scheme for a mouse cell atlas (MCA). We reveal a single-cell hierarchy for many tissues that have not been well characterized previously. We built a web-based “single-cell MCA analysis” pipeline that accurately defines cell types based on single-cell digital expression. Our study demonstrates the wide applicability of the Microwell-seq technology and MCA resource. Development of Microwell-seq allows construction of a mouse cell atlas at the single-cell level with a high-throughput and low-cost platform. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: The annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus inhabits ephemeral ponds in northern Venezuela, South America, and is an emerging extremophile model for vertebrate diapause, stress tolerance, and evolution. Embryos of A. limnaeus regularly experience extended periods of desiccation and anoxia as a part of their natural history and have unique metabolic and developmental adaptations. Currently, there are limited genomic resources available for gene expression and evolutionary studies that can take advantage of A. limnaeus as a unique model system. Results: We describe the first draft genome sequence of A. limnaeus. The genome was assembled de novo using a merged assembly strategy and was annotated using the NCBI Eukaryotic Annotation Pipeline. We show that the assembled genome has a high degree of completeness in genic regions that is on par with several other teleost genomes. Using RNA-seq and phylogenetic-based approaches, we identify several candidate genes that may be important for embryonic stress tolerance and post-diapause development in A. limnaeus. Several of these genes include heat shock proteins that have unique expression patterns in A. limnaeus embryos and at least one of these may be under positive selection. Conclusion: The A. limnaeus genome is the first South American annual killifish genome made publicly available. This genome will be a valuable resource for comparative genomics to determine the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms that support the unique biology of annual killifishes. In a broader context, this genome will be a valuable tool for exploring genome-environment interactions and their impacts on vertebrate physiology and evolution. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Summary Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is extensively associated with cancer development and progression. miRNAs have been shown to be biomarkers for predicting tumor formation and outcome. However, identification of the relationships between miRNA expression and tumor characteristics can be difficult and time-consuming without appropriate bioinformatics expertise. To address this issue, we present OncomiR, an online resource for exploring miRNA dysregulation in cancer. Using combined miRNA-seq, RNA-seq and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we systematically performed statistical analyses to identify dysregulated miRNAs that are associated with tumor development and progression in most major cancer types. Additional analyses further identified potential miRNA-gene target interactions in tumors. These results are stored in a backend database and presented through a web server interface. Moreover, through a backend bioinformatics pipeline, OncomiR can also perform dynamic analysis with custom miRNA selections for in-depth characterization of miRNAs in cancer.

AB  - Background: RNA-Seq has become one of the most widely used applications based on next-generation sequencing technology. However, raw RNA-Seq data may have quality issues, which can significantly distort analytical results and lead to erroneous conclusions. Therefore, the raw data must be subjected to vigorous quality control (QC) procedures before downstream analysis. Currently, an accurate and complete QC of RNA-Seq data requires of a suite of different QC tools used consecutively, which is inefficient in terms of usability, running time, file usage, and interpretability of the results. Results: We developed a comprehensive, fast and easy-to-use QC pipeline for RNA-Seq data, RNA-QC-Chain, which involves three steps: (1) sequencing-quality assessment and trimming; (2) internal (ribosomal RNAs) and external (reads from foreign species) contamination filtering; (3) alignment statistics reporting (such as read number, alignment coverage, sequencing depth and pair-end read mapping information). This package was developed based on our previously reported tool for general QC of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data called QC-Chain, with extensions specifically designed for RNA-Seq data. It has several features that are not available yet in other QC tools for RNA-Seq data, such as RNA sequence trimming, automatic rRNA detection and automatic contaminating species identification. The three QC steps can run either sequentially or independently, enabling RNA-QC-Chain as a comprehensive package with high flexibility and usability. Moreover, parallel computing and optimizations are embedded in most of the QC procedures, providing a superior efficiency. The performance of RNA-QC-Chain has been evaluated with different types of datasets, including an in-house sequencing data, a semi-simulated data, and two real datasets downloaded from public database. Comparisons of RNA-QC-Chain with other QC tools have manifested its superiorities in both function versatility and processing speed. Conclusions: We present here a tool, RNA-QC-Chain, which can be used to comprehensively resolve the quality control processes of RNA-Seq data effectively and efficiently. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Comprehensive understanding of intratumor heterogeneity requires identification of molecular markers, which are capable of differentiating different subpopulations and which also have clinical significance. One important tool that has been addressing this issue is single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNASeq) that allows the quantification of expression profiles of transcripts in individual cells in a population of cancer cells. Using the expression profiles from scRNASeq, current studies conduct analysis to group cells into different subpopulations using clustering algorithms. In this study, we explore scRNASeq cancer data from a different perspective. We focus on scRNASeq data originating from cancer cells pertaining to a particular cancer type, where the cell type or the subpopulation to which each cell belongs is known. We investigate if the "cell type" of a cancer cell can be predicted based on the expression profiles of a small set of transcripts. Results: We outline a predictive analytics pipeline to accurately predict 6 breast cancer cell types using single cell gene expression profiles. Instead of building predictive models using the complete human transcripts, the pipeline first eliminates predictors with low expression and low variance. A multinomial penalized logistic regression further reduces the size of the predictors to only 308, out of which 34 are long non-coding RNAs. Tuning of predictive models shows support vector machines and neural networks as the most accurate models achieving close to 98% prediction accuracies. We also find that mixture of protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs are better predictors compared to when the two sets of transcripts are treated separately. A signature risk score originating from 65 protein coding genes and 5 lncRNA predictors is associated with prognostic survival of TCGA breast cancer patients. This association was maintained when the risk scores were generated using 65 PCGs and 5 lncRNA separately. We further show that predictors restricted to a particular cell type serve as better prognostic markers for the respective patient subtype. Conclusion: Our results show that in general, the breast cancer cell type predictors are also associated with patient survivability and hence have clinical significance. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: High-fidelity preservation strategies for primary tissues are in great demand in the single cell RNAseq community. A reliable method would greatly expand the scope of feasible multi-site collaborations and maximize the utilization of technical expertise. When choosing a method, standardizability and fidelity are important factors to consider due to the susceptibility of single-cell RNAseq analysis to technical noise. Existing approaches such as cryopreservation and chemical fixation are less than ideal for failing to satisfy either or both of these standards. Results: Here we propose a new strategy that leverages preservation schemes developed for organ transplantation. We evaluated the strategy by storing intact mouse kidneys in organ transplant preservative solution at hypothermic temperature for up to 4days (6h, 1, 2, 3, and 4days), and comparing the quality of preserved and fresh samples using FACS and single cell RNAseq. We demonstrate that the strategy effectively maintained cell viability, transcriptome integrity, cell population heterogeneity, and transcriptome landscape stability for samples after up to 3days of preservation. The strategy also facilitated the definition of the diverse spectrum of kidney resident immune cells, to our knowledge the first time at single cell resolution. Conclusions: Hypothermic storage of intact primary tissues in organ transplant preservative maintains the quality and stability of the transcriptome of cells for single cell RNAseq analysis. The strategy is readily generalizable to primary specimens from other tissue types for single cell RNAseq analysis. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The advent and ongoing development of next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) has led to a rapid increase in the rate of human genome re-sequencing data, paving the way for personalized genomics and precision medicine. The body of genome resequencing data is progressively increasing underlining the need for accurate and time-effective bioinformatics systems for genotyping - a crucial prerequisite for identification of candidate causal mutations in diagnostic screens. Results: Here we present CoVaCS, a fully automated, highly accurate system with a web based graphical interface for genotyping and variant annotation. Extensive tests on a gold standard benchmark data-set -the NA12878 Illumina platinum genome- confirm that call-sets based on our consensus strategy are completely in line with those attained by similar command line based approaches, and far more accurate than call-sets from any individual tool. Importantly our system exhibits better sensitivity and higher specificity than equivalent commercial software. Conclusions: CoVaCS offers optimized pipelines integrating state of the art tools for variant calling and annotation for whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES) and target-gene sequencing (TGS) data. The system is currently hosted at Cineca, and offers the speed of a HPC computing facility, a crucial consideration when large numbers of samples must be analysed. Importantly, all the analyses are performed automatically allowing high reproducibility of the results. As such, we believe that CoVaCS can be a valuable tool for the analysis of human genome resequencing studies. CoVaCS is available at: https://bioinformatics.cineca.it/covacs. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The genome of the wild diploid strawberry species Fragaria vesca, an ideal model system of cultivated strawberry (Fragaria ananassa, octoploid) and other Rosaceae family crops, was first published in 2011 and followed by a new assembly (Fvb). However, the annotation for Fvb mainly relied on ab initio predictions and included only predicted coding sequences, therefore an improved annotation is highly desirable. Here, a new annotation version named v2.0.a2 was created for the Fvb genome by a pipeline utilizing one PacBio library, 90 Illumina RNA-seq libraries, and 9 small RNA-seq libraries. Altogether, 18,641 genes (55.6% out of 33,538 genes) were augmented with information on the 50 and/or 30 UTRs, 13,168 (39.3%) protein-coding genes were modified or newly identified, and 7,370 genes were found to possess alternative isoforms. In addition, 1,938 long non-coding RNAs, 171 miRNAs, and 51,714 small RNA clusters were integrated into the annotation. This new annotation of F. vesca is substantially improved in both accuracy and integrity of gene predictions, beneficial to the gene functional studies in strawberry and to the comparative genomic analysis of other horticultural crops in Rosaceae family. © The Author 2017.

AB  - Accurately reconstructing gene co-expression network is of great importance for uncovering the genetic architecture underlying complex and various phenotypes. The recent availability of high-throughput RNA-seq sequencing has made genome-wide detecting and quantifying of the novel, rare and low-abundance transcripts practical. However, its potential merits in reconstructing gene co-expression network have still not been well explored. Using massive-scale RNA-seq samples, we have designed an ensemble pipeline, called NetMiner, for building genome-scale and high-quality Gene Co-expression Network (GCN) by integrating three frequently used inference algorithms. We constructed a RNA-seq-based GCN in one species of monocot rice. The quality of network obtained by our method was verified and evaluated by the curated gene functional association data sets, which obviously outperformed each single method. In addition, the powerful capability of network for associating genes with functions and agronomic traits was shown by enrichment analysis and case studies. In particular, we demonstrated the potential value of our proposed method to predict the biological roles of unknown protein-coding genes, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes and circular RNA (circRNA) genes. Our results provided a valuable and highly reliable data source to select key candidate genes for subsequent experimental validation. To facilitate identification of novel genes regulating important biological processes and phenotypes in other plants or animals, we have published the source code of NetMiner, making it freely available at https://github.com/czllab/NetMiner. © 2018 Yu et al.

AB  - Calotropis gigantea produces specialized secondary metabolites known as cardenolides, which have anticancer and antimalarial properties. Although transcriptomic studies have been conducted in other cardenolide-producing species, no nuclear genome assembly for an Asterid cardenolide-producing species has been reported to date. A high-quality de novo assembly was generated for C. gigantea, representing 157,284,427 bp with an N50 scaffold size of 805,959 bp, for which quality assessments indicated a near complete representation of the genic space. Transcriptome data in the form of RNAsequencing libraries from a developmental tissue series was generated to aid the annotation and construction of a gene expression atlas. Using an ab initio and evidence-driven gene annotation pipeline, 18,197 highconfidence genes were annotated. Homologous and syntenic relationships between C. gigantea and other species within the Apocynaceae family confirmed previously identified evolutionary relationships, and suggest the emergence or loss of the specialized cardenolide metabolites after the divergence of the Apocynaceae subfamilies. The C. gigantea genome assembly, annotation, and RNA-sequencing data provide a novel resource to study the cardenolide biosynthesis pathway, especially for understanding the evolutionary origin of cardenolides and the engineering of cardenolide production in heterologous organisms for existing and novel pharmaceutical applications. © 2018 Hoopes et al.

AB  - RNA editing increases the diversity of the transcriptome and proteome. Adenosine-to-ino-sine (A-to-I) editing is the predominant type of RNA editing in mammals and it is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) family. Here, we used a largescale computational analysis of transcriptomic data from brain, heart, colon, lung, spleen, kidney, testes, skeletal muscle and liver, from three adult animals in order to identify RNA editing sites in bovine. We developed a computational pipeline and used a rigorous strategy to identify novel editing sites from RNA-Seq data in the absence of corresponding DNA sequence information. Our methods take into account sequencing errors, mapping bias, as well as biological replication to reduce the probability of obtaining a false-positive result. We conducted a detailed characterization of sequence and structural features related to novel candidate sites and found 1,600 novel canonical A-to-I editing sites in the nine bovine tissues analyzed. Results show that these sites 1) occur frequently in clusters and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) repeats, 2) have a preference for guanines depletion/enrichment in the flanking 50/30 nucleotide, 3) occur less often in coding sequences than other regions of the genome, and 4) have low evolutionary conservation. Further, we found that a positive correlation exists between expression of ADAR family members and tissue-specific RNA editing. Most of the genes with predicted A-to-I editing in each tissue were significantly enriched in biological terms relevant to the function of the corresponding tissue. Lastly, the results highlight the importance of the RNA editome in nervous system regulation. The present study extends the list of RNA editing sites in bovine and provides pipelines that may be used to investigate the editome in other organisms. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

AB  - In a proteogenomic approach based on tandem mass spectrometry analysis of proteolytic peptide mixtures, customized exome or RNA-seq databases are employed for identifying protein sequence variants. However, the problem of variant peptide identification without personalized genomic data is important for a variety of applications. Following the recent proposal by Chick et al. (Nat. Biotechnol. 33, 743–749, 2015) on the feasibility of such variant peptide search, we evaluated two available approaches based on the previously suggested “open” search and the “brute-force” strategy. To improve the efficiency of these approaches, we propose an algorithm for exclusion of false variant identifications from the search results involving analysis of modifications mimicking single amino acid substitutions. Also, we propose a de novo based scoring scheme for assessment of identified point mutations. In the scheme, the search engine analyzes y-type fragment ions in MS/MS spectra to confirm the location of the mutation in the variant peptide sequence.

AB  - Noncoding transcription is a defining feature of active enhancers, linking transcription factor (TF) binding to the molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression. To determine the relationship between enhancer activity and biological outcomes in breast cancers, we profiled the transcriptomes (using GRO-seq and RNA-seq) and epigenomes (using ChIP-seq) of 11 different human breast cancer cell lines representing five major molecular subtypes of breast cancer, as well as two immortalized ("normal") human breast cell lines. In addition, we developed a robust and unbiased computational pipeline that simultaneously identifies putative subtype-specific enhancers and their cognate TFs by integrating the magnitude of enhancer transcription, TF mRNA expression levels, TF motif P-values, and enrichment of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. When applied across the 13 different cell lines noted above, the Total Functional Score of Enhancer Elements (TFSEE) identified key breast cancer subtype-specific TFs that act at transcribed enhancers to dictate gene expression patterns determining growth outcomes, including Forkhead TFs, FOSL1, and PLAG1. FOSL1, a Fos family TF, (1) is highly enriched at the enhancers of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, (2) acts as a key regulator of the proliferation and viability of TNBC cells, but not Luminal A cells, and (3) is associated with a poor prognosis in TNBC breast cancer patients. Taken together, our results validate our enhancer identification pipeline and reveal that enhancers transcribed in breast cancer cells direct critical gene regulatory networks that promote pathogenesis. © 2018 Franco et al.

AB  - Mosaicism due to somatic mutations can cause multiple diseases including cancer, developmental and overgrowth syndromes, neurodevelopmental disorders, autoinflammatory diseases, and atrial fibrillation. With the increased use of next generation sequencing technology, multiple tools have been developed to identify low-frequency variants, specifically from matched tumor-normal tissues in cancer studies. To investigate whether mosaic variants are implicated in congenital heart disease (CHD), we developed a pipeline using the cancer somatic variant caller MuTect to identify mosaic variants in whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from a cohort of parent/affected child trios (n = 715) and a cohort of healthy individuals (n = 416). This is a novel application of the somatic variant caller designed for cancer to WES trio data. We identified two cases with mosaic KMT2D mutations that are likely pathogenic for CHD, but conclude that, overall, mosaicism detectable in peripheral blood or saliva does not account for a significant portion of CHD etiology. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Context: Self-limited delayed puberty (DP) is often associated with a delay in physical maturation, but although highly heritable the causal genetic factors remain elusive. Genome-wide association studies of the timing of puberty have identified multiple loci for age at menarche in females and voice break in males, particularly in pathways controlling energy balance. Objective/Main Outcome Measures: We sought to assess the contribution of rare variants in such genes to the phenotype of familial DP. Design/Patients: We performed whole-exome sequencing in 67 pedigrees (125 individuals with DP and 35 unaffected controls) from our unique cohort of familial self-limited DP. Using a whole-exome sequencing filtering pipeline one candidate gene [fat mass and obesity-Associated gene (FTO)] was identified. In silico, in vitro, and mouse model studies were performed to investigate the pathogenicity of FTO variants and timing of puberty in FTO+/2 mice. Results: We identified potentially pathogenic, rare variants in genes in linkage disequilibrium with genome-wide association studies of age at menarche loci in 283 genes. Of these, five genes were implicated in the control of body mass. After filtering for segregation with trait, one candidate, FTO, was retained. Two FTO variants, found in 14 affected individuals from three families, were also associated with leanness in these patients with DP. One variant (p.Leu44Val) demonstrated altered demethylation activity of the mutant protein in vitro. Fto+/2 mice displayed a significantly delayed timing of pubertal onset (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Mutations in genes implicated in body mass and timing of puberty in the general population may contribute to the pathogenesis of self-limited DP. Copyright © 2018 Endocrine Society.

AB  - Background: Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic sequences that randomly propagate within their host's genome. This mobility has the potential to affect gene transcription and cause disease. However, TEs are technically challenging to identify, which complicates efforts to assess the impact of TE insertions on disease. Here we present a targeted sequencing protocol and computational pipeline to identify polymorphic and novel TE insertions using next-generation sequencing: TE-NGS. The method simultaneously targets the three subfamilies that are responsible for the majority of recent TE activity (L1HS, AluYa5/8, and AluYb8/9) thereby obviating the need for multiple experiments and reducing the amount of input material required. Results: Here we describe the laboratory protocol and detection algorithm, and a benchmark experiment for the reference genome NA12878. We demonstrate a substantial enrichment for on-target fragments, and high sensitivity and precision to both reference and NA12878-specific insertions. We report 17 previously unreported loci for this individual which are supported by orthogonal long-read evidence, and we identify 1470 polymorphic and novel TEs in 12 additional samples that were previously undocumented in databases of insertion polymorphisms. Conclusions: We anticipate that future applications of TE-NGS alongside exome sequencing of patients with sporadic disease will reduce the number of unresolved cases, and improve estimates of the contribution of TEs to human genetic disease. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Modern single-cell technologies allow multiplexed sampling of cellular states within a tissue. However, computational tools that can infer developmental cell-state transitions reproducibly from such single-cell data are lacking. Here, we introduce p-Creode, an unsupervised algorithm that produces multi-branching graphs from single-cell data, compares graphs with differing topologies, and infers a statistically robust hierarchy of cell-state transitions that define developmental trajectories. We have applied p-Creode to mass cytometry, multiplex immunofluorescence, and single-cell RNA-seq data. As a test case, we validate cell-state-transition trajectories predicted by p-Creode for intestinal tuft cells, a rare, chemosensory cell type. We clarify that tuft cells are specified outside of the Atoh1-dependent secretory lineage in the small intestine. However, p-Creode also predicts, and we confirm, that tuft cells arise from an alternative, Atoh1-driven developmental program in the colon. These studies introduce p-Creode as a reliable method for analyzing large datasets that depict branching transition trajectories. Herring et al. developed an unsupervised algorithm to map single-cell RNA-seq, imaging, and mass cytometry onto multi-branching transitional trajectories. This approach identified alternative origins of tuft cells, a specialized chemosensory cell in the gut, between the small intestine and the colon. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Background: RNA editing is an important mechanism that expands the diversity and complexity of genetic codes. The conversions of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) and cytosine (C) to uridine (U) are two prominent types of RNA editing in animals. The roles of RNA editing events have been implicated in important biological pathways. Cellular RNA editing activity in response to influenza A virus infection has not been fully characterized in human and avian hosts. This study was designed as a big data analysis to investigate the role and response of RNA editing in epithelial cells during the course of infection with various subtypes of influenza A viruses. Results: Using a bioinformatics pipeline modified from our previous study, we characterized the profiles of A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing events in human epithelial cells during the course of influenza A virus infection. Our results revealed a striking diversity of A-to-I RNA editing activities in human epithelial cells in responses to different subtypes of influenza A viruses. The infection of H1N1 and H3N2 significantly up-regulated normalized A-to-I RNA editing levels in human epithelial cells, whereas that of H5N1 did not change it and H7N9 infection significantly down-regulated normalized A-to-I editing level in A549 cells. Next, the expression levels of ADAR and APOBEC enzymes responsible for A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing during the course of virus infection were examined. The increase of A-to-I RNA editing activities in infections with some influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) is linked to the up-regulation of ADAR1 but not ADAR2. Further, the pattern recognition receptors of human epithelial cells infected with H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9 were examined. Variable responsive changes in gene expression were observed with RIG-I like receptors and Toll like receptors. Finally, the effect of influenza A virus infection on cellular RNA editing activity was also analyzed in avian hosts. Conclusion: This work represents the first comprehensive study of cellular RNA editing activity in response to different influenza A virus infections in human and avian hosts, highlighting the critical role of RNA editing in innate immune response and the pathogenicity of different subtypes of influenza A viruses. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Salmonid fishes exhibit high levels of phenotypic and ecological variation and are thus ideal model systems for studying evolutionary processes of adaptive divergence and speciation. Furthermore, salmonids are of major interest in fisheries, aquaculture, and conservation research. Improving understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying traits in these species would significantly progress research in these fields. Here we generate high quality de novo transcriptomes for four salmonid species: Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brown trout (Salmo trutta), Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), and European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). All species except Atlantic salmon have no reference genome publicly available and few if any genomic studies to date. Results: We used paired-end RNA-seq on Illumina to generate high coverage sequencing of multiple individuals, yielding between 180 and 210 M reads per species. After initial assembly, strict filtering was used to remove duplicated, redundant, and low confidence transcripts. The final assemblies consisted of 36,505 protein-coding transcripts for Atlantic salmon, 35,736 for brown trout, 33,126 for Arctic charr, and 33,697 for European whitefish and are made publicly available. Assembly completeness was assessed using three approaches, all of which supported high quality of the assemblies: 1) ~78% of Actinopterygian single-copy orthologs were successfully captured in our assemblies, 2) orthogroup inference identified high overlap in the protein sequences present across all four species (40% shared across all four and 84% shared by at least two), and 3) comparison with the published Atlantic salmon genome suggests that our assemblies represent well covered (~98%) protein-coding transcriptomes. Thorough comparison of the generated assemblies found that 84-90% of transcripts in each assembly were orthologous with at least one of the other three species. We also identified 34-37% of transcripts in each assembly as paralogs. We further compare completeness and annotation statistics of our new assemblies to available related species. Conclusion: New, high-confidence protein-coding transcriptomes were generated for four ecologically and economically important species of salmonids. This offers a high quality pipeline for such complex genomes, represents a valuable contribution to the existing genomic resources for these species and provides robust tools for future investigation of gene expression and sequence evolution in these and other salmonid species. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-Derived Tumour Xenografts (PDTXs) have emerged as the pre-clinical models that best represent clinical tumour diversity and intra-tumour heterogeneity. The molecular characterization of PDTXs using High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) is essential; however, the presence of mouse stroma is challenging for HTS data analysis. Indeed, the high homology between the two genomes results in a proportion of mouse reads being mapped as human.
RESULTS: In this study we generated Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from samples with known mixtures of mouse and human DNA or RNA and from a cohort of human breast cancers and their derived PDTXs. We show that using an In silico Combined human-mouse Reference Genome (ICRG) for alignment discriminates between human and mouse reads with up to 99.9% accuracy and decreases the number of false positive somatic mutations caused by misalignment by >99.9%. We also derived a model to estimate the human DNA content in independent PDTX samples. For RNA-seq and RRBS data analysis, the use of the ICRG allows dissecting computationally the transcriptome and methylome of human tumour cells and mouse stroma. In a direct comparison with previously reported approaches, our method showed similar or higher accuracy while requiring significantly less computing time.
CONCLUSIONS: The computational pipeline we describe here is a valuable tool for the molecular analysis of PDTXs as well as any other mixture of DNA or RNA species.

AB  - To detect functional somatic mutations in tumor samples, whole-exome sequencing (WES) is often used for its reliability and relative low cost. RNA-seq, while generally used to measure gene expression, can potentially also be used for identification of somatic mutations. However there has been little systematic evaluation of the utility of RNA-seq for identifying somatic mutations. Here, we develop and evaluate a pipeline for processing RNA-seq data from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors in order to identify somatic mutations. The pipeline entails the use of the STAR aligner 2-pass procedure jointly with MuTect2 from genome analysis toolkit (GATK) to detect somatic variants. Variants identified from RNA-seq data were evaluated by comparison against the COSMIC and dbSNP databases, and also compared to somatic variants identified by exome sequencing. We also estimated the putative functional impact of coding variants in the most frequently mutated genes in GBM. Interestingly, variants identified by RNA-seq alone showed better representation of GBM-related mutations cataloged by COSMIC. RNA-seq-only data substantially outperformed the ability of WES to reveal potentially new somatic mutations in known GBM-related pathways, and allowed us to build a high-quality set of somatic mutations common to exome and RNA-seq calls. Using RNA-seq data in parallel with WES data to detect somatic mutations in cancer genomes can thus broaden the scope of discoveries and lend additional support to somatic variants identified by exome sequencing alone. © 2018 Coudray et al.

AB  - Motivation: Analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data in human saliva is challenging. Lack of standardization and unification of the bioinformatic procedures undermines saliva's diagnostic potential. Thus, it motivated us to perform this study. Results: We applied principal pipelines for bioinformatic analysis of small RNA-Seq data of saliva of 98 healthy Korean volunteers including either direct or indirect mapping of the reads to the human genome using Bowtie1. Analysis of alignments to exogenous genomes by another pipeline revealed that almost all of the reads map to bacterial genomes. Thus, salivary exRNA has fundamental properties that warrant the design of unique additional steps while performing the bioinformatic analysis. Our pipelines can serve as potential guidelines for processing of RNA-Seq data of human saliva. © 2017 The Author.

AB  - Background: Many bioinformatics pipelines are available nowadays to analyze transcriptomics data produced by high-throughput RNA sequencing. They implement different workflows that address several analysis tasks, supported by the use of third party programs. Nevertheless, a proper workflow definition for RNA-seq data analysis is still lacking. Objective: To proper define what a comprehensive RNA-seq data analysis workflow should be. Compare all available pipelines and, if such a solution is not available, implement a new pipeline. Method: We have developed a new pipeline integrating state-of-the art programs for different parts of the RNA-seq analysis. We also have used RUbioSeq libraries to achieve a scalable solution. Results: We have defined a comprehensive RNA-seq data analysis workflow, comprising the most common needs demanded by biologists and implemented it in a new pipeline, nextpresso. We also validate it in two case studies presented here. Conclusion: Nexpresso is a new, freely available, pipeline covering the most common needs of RNA-seq data analysis. It is easy to configure, generates user friendly results and scales well for larger studies comprising a high number of samples. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - RNA-Seq is increasingly being used to measure human RNA expression on a genome-wide scale. Expression profiles can be interrogated to identify and functionally characterize treatment-responsive genes. Ultimately, such controlled studies promise to reveal insights into molecular mechanisms of treatment effects, identify biomarkers, and realize personalized medicine. RNA-Seq Reports (RSEQREP) is a new open-source cloud-enabled framework that allows users to execute start-to-end gene-level RNA-Seq analysis on a preconfigured RSEQREP Amazon Virtual Machine Image (AMI) hosted by AWS or on their own Ubuntu Linux machine via a Docker container or installation script. The framework works with unstranded, stranded, and paired-end sequence FASTQ files stored locally, on Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), or at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). RSEQREP automatically executes a series of customizable steps including reference alignment, CRAM compression, reference alignment QC, data normalization, multivariate data visualization, identification of differentially expressed genes, heatmaps, co-expressed gene clusters, enriched pathways, and a series of custom visualizations. The framework outputs a file collection that includes a dynamically generated PDF report using R, knitr, and LaTeX, as well as publication-ready table and figure files. A user-friendly configuration file handles sample metadata entry, processing, analysis, and reporting options. The configuration supports time series RNA-Seq experimental designs with at least one pre- and one post-treatment sample for each subject, as well as multiple treatment groups and specimen types. All RSEQREP analyses components are built using open-source R code and R/Bioconductor packages allowing for further customization. As a use case, we provide RSEQREP results for a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) RNA-Seq study that collected 1 pre-TIV and 10 post-TIV vaccination samples (days 1-10) for 5 subjects and two specimen types (peripheral blood mononuclear cells and B-cells). © 2018 Jensen TL et al.

AB  - RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the experimental standard in transcriptome studies. While most of the bioinformatic pipelines for the analysis of RNA-Seq data and the identification of significant changes in transcript abundance are based on the comparison of two conditions, it is common practice to perform several experiments in parallel (e.g. from different individuals, developmental stages, tissues), for the identification of genes showing a significant variation of expression across all the conditions studied. In this work we present RNentropy, a methodology based on information theory devised for this task, which given expression estimates from any number of RNA-Seq samples and conditions identifies genes or transcripts with a significant variation of expression across all the conditions studied, together with the samples in which they are over- or under-expressed. To show the capabilities offered by our methodology, we applied it to different RNA-Seq datasets: 48 biological replicates of two different yeast conditions; samples extracted from six human tissues of three individuals; seven different mouse brain cell types; human liver samples from six individuals. Results, and their comparison to different state of the art bioinformatic methods, show that RNentropy can provide a quick and in depth analysis of significant changes in gene expression profiles over any number of conditions. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Sequence similarity among distinct genomic regions can lead to errors in alignment of short reads from next-generation sequencing. While this is well known, the downstream consequences of misalignment have not been fully characterized. We assessed the potential for incorrect alignment of RNA-sequencing reads to cause false positives in both gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and co-expression analyses. Trans-eQTLs identified from human RNA-sequencing studies appeared to be particularly affected by this phenomenon, even when only uniquely aligned reads are considered. Over 75\% of trans-eQTLs using a standard pipeline occurred between regions of sequence similarity and therefore could be due to alignment errors. Further, associations due to mapping errors are likely to misleadingly replicate between studies. To help address this problem, we quantified the potential for "cross-mapping'' to occur between every pair of annotated genes in the human genome. Such cross-mapping data can be used to filter or flag potential false positives in both trans-eQTL and co-expression analyses. Such filtering substantially alters the detection of significant associations and can have an impact on the assessment of false discovery rate, functional enrichment, and replication for RNA-sequencing association studies. © 2018 Saha A and Battle A.

AB  - Detection of differential transcript usage (DTU) from RNA-seq data is an important bioinformatic analysis that complements differential gene expression analysis. Here we present a simple workflow using a set of existing R/Bioconductor packages for analysis of DTU. We show how these packages can be used downstream of RNA-seq quantification using the Salmon software package. The entire pipeline is fast, benefiting from inference steps by Salmon to quantify expression at the transcript level. The workflow includes live, runnable code chunks for analysis using DRIMSeq and DEXSeq, as well as for performing two-stage testing of DTU using the stageR package, a statistical framework to screen at the gene level and then confirm which transcripts within the significant genes show evidence of DTU. We evaluate these packages and other related packages on a simulated dataset with parameters estimated from real data.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts generally longer than 200 nucleotides with no or poor protein coding potential, and most of their functions are also poorly characterized. Recently, an increasing number of studies have shown that lncRNAs can be involved in various critical biological processes such as organism development or cancer progression. Little, however, is known about their effects in helminths parasites, such as Schistosoma mansoni. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify and characterize lncRNAs from RNA-seq data with high confidence from S. mansoni adult worms. Through the utilization of different criteria such as genome localization, exon number, gene length, and stability, we identified 170 new putative lncRNAs. All novel S. mansoni lncRNAs have no conserved synteny including human and mouse. These closest protein coding genes were enriched in 10 significant Gene Ontology terms related to metabolism, transport, and biosynthesis. Fifteen putative lncRNAs showed differential expression, and three displayed sex-specific differential expressions in praziquantel sensitive and resistant adult worm couples. Together, our method can predict a set of novel lncRNAs from the RNA-seq data. Some lncRNAs are shown to be differentially expressed suggesting that those novel lncRNAs can be given high priority in further functional studies focused on praziquantel resistance. © 2018 Victor F.

AB  - Electroacupuncture (EA) can relieve various pains. However, its mechanism in terms of the transcriptome is still not well-known. To explore the full profile of EA-induced molecular modification in the central nerve system, three twins of goats were selected for a match-paired experiment: EA stimulation (60 Hz, 30 min) and none-EA (control). Goats in the EA group showed an increased (p < 0.05) nociceptive threshold compared with the control goats. Experimental goats were sacrificed at 4 h of the experiment, and the periaqueductal grays were harvested for RNA sequencing. As a result, 2651 differentially expressed genes (1803 up-regulated and 848 down-regulated genes) were found and enriched in 30 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and 149 gene ontology terms. EA-regulated five neuropeptide genes (proenkephalin, proopiomelanocortin, preprodynorphin, diazepam-binding inhibitor and proprotein convertase 1 inhibitor) were validated with quantitative PCR. Furthermore, up-regulated glutamate receptors, glutamate transporters,-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, GABA transporters, synaptotagmins or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) genes might contribute to EA-induced analgesia through regulating the glutamatergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, MAPKs, ribosome or ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Our findings reveal a full profile of molecular modification in response to EA and provide a solid experimental framework for exploring the mechanisms underlying EA-induced analgesia. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Communication and nutrition are major drivers of fitness in ants. While communication is paramount to colony cohesion, nutrition is decisive in regulating reproductive division of labor among colony members. However, neither of these has been studied from a molecular perspective in developing individuals. Here, we report the availability of the first transcriptome resources for larvae of the ant Formica fusca, a species with excellent discrimination abilities and thus the potential to become a model system for studying molecular mechanisms of communication. We generated a comprehensive, high-coverage RNA-seq data set using Illumina RNA-seq technology by sequencing 24 individual 1 st -2 nd instar larvae collected from four experimental groups (6 samples per treatment, 49 million mean reads per sample, coverage between 194–253×). A total of 24,765 unigenes were generated using a combination of genome-guided and de novo transcriptome assembly. A comprehensive assembly pipeline and annotation lists are provided. This dataset adds valuable transcriptomic resources for further study of developmental gene expression, transcriptional regulation and functional gene activity in ant larvae. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Up until now, the regulation mechanism at the level of gene during lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unclear. The discovery of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LPS-induced ARDS rats and normal rats by next-generation RNA sequencing analysis is of particular interest for the current study. These DEGs may help clinical diagnosis of ARDS and facilitate the selection of the optimal treatment strategy. Randomly, 20 rats were equally divided into 2 groups, the control group and the LPS group. Three rats from each group were selected at random for RNA sequencing analysis. Sequence reads were obtained from Illumina HiSeq4000 and mapped onto the rat reference genome RN6 using Hisat2. We identified 5244 DEGs (Fold-Change > 1.5, and P<0.05) in the lung tissues from LPS-treated rats compared with normal rats, including 1413 upregulated and 3831 downregulated expressed genes. Lots of chemokine family members were among the most upregulated genes in LPS group. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that almost all of the most enriched and meaningful biological process terms were mainly involved in the functions like immune-inflammation response and the pathways like cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. We also found that, as for GO molecular function terms, the enriched terms were mainly related to chemokines and cytokines. DEGs with fold change over 100 were verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and reanalyzed by gene-gene coexpression network, and the results elucidated central roles of chemokines in LPS-induced ARDS. Our results revealed some new biomarkers for uncovering mechanisms and processes of ARDS. © 2018 Qi-Quan Wan et al.

AB  - Numerous statistical pipelines are now available for the differential analysis of gene expression measured with RNAsequencing technology. Most of them are based on similar statistical frameworks after normalization, differing primarily in the choice of data distribution, mean and variance estimation strategy and data filtering.We propose an evaluation of the impact of these choices when few biological replicates are available through the use of synthetic data sets. This framework is based on real data sets and allows the exploration of various scenarios differing in the proportion of non-differentially expressed genes. Hence, it provides an evaluation of the key ingredients of the differential analysis, free of the biases associated with the simulation of data using parametric models. Our results show the relevance of a proper modeling of the mean by using linear or generalized linear modeling. Once the mean is properly modeled, the impact of the other parameters on the performance of the test is much less important. Finally, we propose to use the simple visualization of the raw P-value histogramas a practical evaluation criterion of the performance of differential analysis methods on real data sets. © The Author 2016.

AB  - Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus has substantial economic impact on the cattle breeding industry and, chemical control and tick resistance development are the major concern. There is a worldwide search for new options, and control using vaccines has been the main focus nowadays. Studies performed in Brazil found that Bm86-based immunization of bovines reduced the infestation of R. (B.) microplus of vaccinated bovines by 45% to 60%. Native Boophilus microplus tripsin inhibitors (BmTIs) with trypsin-, kallikrein-, and elastase-inhibiting activities have been used as immunogens in bovines reaching 72.8.% of efficacy. The reverse vaccinology approach has also been used for antigen search using transcriptome analysis to identify and characterize potential antigens. Study has generated more than 600 million sequences using RNA-seq of larvae, nymphs, salivary glands, intestines, and ovaries of the tick R. (B) microplus. Based on the set of transcripts obtained using this strategy, a total of 20,326 protein sequences have been identified. A pipeline analysis built in house identified the protein sequences that were most likely to be immunogenic based on the overall structural characteristic analysis. © 2018 Frontiers in Bioscience.

AB  - Despite tremendous advances in targeted therapies against lung adenocarcinoma, the majority of patients do not benefit from personalized treatments. A deeper understanding of potential therapeutic targets is crucial to increase the survival of patients. One promising target, ADAR, is amplified in 13% of lung adenocarcinomas and in-vitro studies have demonstrated the potential of its therapeutic inhibition to inhibit tumor growth. ADAR edits millions of adenosines to inosines within the transcriptome, and while previous studies of ADAR in cancer have solely focused on protein-coding edits, > 99% of edits occur in non-protein coding regions. Here, we develop a pipeline to discover the regulatory potential of RNA editing sites across the entire transcriptome and apply it to lung adenocarcinoma tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas. This method predicts that 1413 genes contain regulatory edits, predominantly in non-coding regions. Genes with the largest numbers of regulatory edits are enriched in both apoptotic and innate immune pathways, providing a link between these known functions of ADAR and its role in cancer. We further show that despite a positive association between ADAR RNA expression and apoptotic and immune pathways, ADAR copy number is negatively associated with apoptosis and several immune cell types' signatures. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most economically important swine pathogens and causes reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease in growing pigs. PRRSV mainly infects porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), leading to the subversion of innate and adaptive immunity of pigs. The transcriptome analysis of gene expression profiles in PRRSV-infected PAMs is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of PRRSV. Here we performed next-generation RNA sequencing and a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to characterize the dynamic transcriptome landscapes in PAMs following PRRSV infection. Totally 38222 annotated mRNAs, 12987 annotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 17624 novel lncRNAs in PRRSV-infected PAMs were identified through a transcripts computational identification pipeline. The differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs during PRRSV infection were characterized. Several differentially expressed transcripts were validated using qRT-PCR. Analyses on dynamic overrepresented GO terms and KEGG pathways in PRRSV-infected PAMs at different time points were performed. Meanwhile the genes involved in IFN-related signaling pathways, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation and processing were significantly downregulated, indicating the aberrant function of PAMs during PRRSV infection. Moreover, the differentially and highly expressed lncRNA XR-297549.1 was predicted to both cis-regulate and trans-regulate its neighboring gene, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), indicating its role in inflammatory response. Our findings reveal the transcriptome profiles and differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in PRRSV-infected PAMs in vitro, providing valuable information for further exploration of PRRSV pathogenesis. © 2018 Nanfang Zeng et al.

AB  - Data exploration is critical to the comprehension of large biological data sets generated by high-throughput assays such as sequencing. However, most existing tools for interactive visualisation are limited to specific assays or analyses. Here, we present the iSEE (Interactive SummarizedExperiment Explorer) software package, which provides a general visual interface for exploring data in a SummarizedExperiment object. iSEE is directly compatible with many existing R/Bioconductor packages for analysing high-throughput biological data, and provides useful features such as simultaneous examination of (meta)data and analysis results, dynamic linking between plots and code tracking for reproducibility. We demonstrate the utility and flexibility of iSEE by applying it to explore a range of real transcriptomics and proteomics data sets. © 2018 Rue-Albrecht K et al.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What is the transcriptional network governed by the androgen receptor (AR) in human epididymis epithelial (HEE) cells from the caput region and if the network is tissue-specific, how is this achieved? SUMMARY ANSWER: About 200 genes are differentially expressed in the caput HEE cells after AR activation; the AR transcriptional network is tissue-specific and may be mediated in part by distinct AR co-factors including CAAT-enhancer binding protein beta (CEBPB) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Little is known about the AR transcriptional program genome wide in HEE cells, nor its co-factors in those cells. AR has been best studied in the prostate gland epithelium and prostate cancer cell lines, due to the important role of this factor in prostate cancer. However AR-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and AR co-factors have not yet been compared between human epididymis and prostate epithelial cells. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Caput HEE cells from two donors were exposed to the synthetic androgen R1881 at 1 nM for 12-16 h after 72 h of hormone starvation. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Chromatin was prepared from R1881-treated and vehicle control HEE cells. AR-associated chromatin was purified by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and AR occupancy genome wide was revealed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). Two independent biological replicates were performed. Total RNA was prepared from R1881 and control-treated HEE cells and gene expression profiles were documented by RNA-seq. The interaction of the potential novel AR co-factors CEBPB and RUNX1, identified through in-silico motif analysis of AR ChIP-seq data, was examined by ChIP-qPCR after siRNA-mediated depletion of each co-factor individually or simultaneously. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The results identify about 200 genes that are differentially expressed (DEGs) in HEE cells after AR activation. Some of these DEGs show occupancy of AR at their promoters or cis-regulatory elements suggesting direct regulation. However, there is little overlap in AR-associated DEGs between HEE and prostate epithelial cells. Inspection of over-represented motifs in AR ChIP-seq peaks identified CEBPB and RUNX1 as potential co-factors, with no evidence for FOXA1, which is an important co-factor in the prostate epithelium. CEBPB and RUNX1 ChIP-seq in HEE cells showed that both these factors often occupied AR-binding sites, though rarely simultaneously. Further analysis at a single AR-regulated locus (FK506-binding protein 5, FKPB5) suggests that CEBPB may be a coactivator. These data suggest a novel AR transcriptional network governs differentiated functions of the human epididymis epithelium. LARGE SCALE DATA: AR ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data are deposited at GEO: GSE109063. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There is substantial donor-to-donor variation in primary HEE cells cultures. We applied stringent statistical tests with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1% for ChIP-seq and standard pipelines for RNA-seq so it is possible that we have missed some AR-regulated genes that are important in caput epididymis function. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our data suggest that a novel AR transcriptional network governs differentiated functions of the human epididymis epithelium. Since this cell layer has a critical role in normal sperm maturation, the results are of broader significance in understanding the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of fertility in men.

AB  - Biotechnology revolution generates a plethora of omics data with an exponential growth pace. Therefore, biological data mining demands automatic, 'high quality' curation efforts to organize biomedical knowledge into online databases. BioDataome is a database of uniformly preprocessed and disease-annotated omics data with the aim to promote and accelerate the reuse of public data. We followed the same preprocessing pipeline for each biological mart (microarray gene expression, RNA-Seq gene expression and DNA methylation) to produce ready for downstream analysis datasets and automatically annotated them with disease-ontology terms. We also designate datasets that share common samples and automatically discover control samples in case-control studies. Currently, BioDataome includes ∼1/45600 datasets, ∼1/4260 000 samples spanning ∼1/4500 diseases and can be easily used in large-scale massive experiments and meta-analysis. All datasets are publicly available for querying and downloading via BioDataome web application. We demonstrate BioDataome's utility by presenting exploratory data analysis examples. We have also developed BioDataome R package found in: https://github.com/mensxmachina/BioDataome/. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - MicroRNAs play critical roles in oncogenesis by targeting a few key regulators or a large cohort of genes impinging on downstream signaling pathways. Conversely, miRNA activity is also titrated by competitive endogenous RNA such as lncRNA with sponge effect. Web-based server, miRNACancerMap, aims to unravel lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA tripartite complexity to predict the function and clinical relevance of miRNA with network perspective. In conjunction with large-scale data and information integration, miRNACancerMap implements various algorithms and pipelines to construct dynamic miRNA-centered network with rigorous Systems Biology approaches and the state-of-the-art visualization tool. The capability of the server to generate testable hypotheses was exemplified with cases to identify hub miRNAs regulating most of the differentially-expressed genes involved in cancer stage transition, miRNA-TF pairs shared by pan-cancers and lncRNA sponges validated by multiple datasets. LncRNAs sharing the same miRNAs binding sites as mRNAs can sequester miRNAs and indirectly regulate the activity of the related mRNAs. We have re-annotated traditional microarray chips, and included these datasets in the server to enable validation of the predicted lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulations derived from TCGA RNA-seq data. Of note, our server enables identifying miRNAs associated with cancer signaling pathways, and related lncRNA sponges from pan-cancers with only a few mouse clicks. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Background and Objective: Docker is a light containerization program that shows almost the same performance as a local environment. Recently, many bioinformatics tools have been distributed as Docker images that include complex settings such as libraries, configurations, and data if needed, as well as the actual tools. Users can simply download and run them without making the effort to compile and configure them, and can obtain reproducible results. In spite of these advantages, several problems remain. First, there is a lack of clear standards for distribution of Docker images, and the Docker Hub often provides multiple images with the same objective but different uses. For these reasons, it can be difficult for users to learn how to select and use them. Second, Docker images are often not suitable as a component of a pipeline, because many of them include big data. Moreover, a group of users can have difficulties when sharing a pipeline composed of Docker images. Users of a group may modify scripts or use different versions of the data, which causes inconsistent results. Methods and Results: To handle the problems described above, we developed a Java web application, DockerBIO, which provides reliable, verified, light-weight Docker images for various bioinformatics tools and for various kinds of reference data. With DockerBIO, users can easily build a pipeline with tools and data registered at DockerBIO, and if necessary, users can easily register new tools or data. Built pipelines are registered in DockerBIO, which provides an efficient running environment for the pipelines registered at DockerBIO. This enables user groups to run their pipelines without expending much effort to copy and modify them. Copyright 2018 Kwon et al.

AB  - Asexual propagation and whole body regeneration are forms of nonembryonic development (NED) widespread across animal phyla and central in life history and evolutionary diversification of metazoans. Whereas it is challenging to reconstruct the gains or losses of NED at large phylogenetic scale, comparative studies could benefit from being conducted at more restricted taxonomic scale, in groups for which phylogenetic relationships are well established. The ascidian family of Styelidae encompasses strictly sexually reproducing solitary forms as well as colonial species that combine sexual reproduction with different forms of NED. To date, the phylogenetic relationships between colonial and solitary styelids remain controversial and so is the pattern of NED evolution. In this study, we built an original pipeline to combine eight genomes with 18 de novo assembled transcriptomes and constructed data sets of unambiguously orthologous genes. Using a phylogenomic super-matrix of 4, 908 genes from these 26 tunicates we provided a robust phylogeny of this family of chordates, which supports two convergent acquisitions of NED. This result prompted us to further describe the budding process in the species Polyandrocarpa zorritensis, leading to the discovery of a novel mechanism of asexual development. Whereas the pipeline and the data sets produced can be used for further phylogenetic reconstructions in tunicates, the phylogeny provided here sets an evolutionary framework for future experimental studies on the emergence and disappearance of complex characters such as asexual propagation and whole body regeneration. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Designing novel RNA topologies is a challenge, with important therapeutic and industrial applications. We describe a computational pipeline for design of novel RNA topologies based on our coarse-grained RNA-As-Graphs (RAG) framework. RAG represents RNA structures as tree graphs and describes RNA secondary (2D) structure topologies (currently up to 13 vertices, ≈260 nucleotides). We have previously identified novel graph topologies that are RNA-like among these. Here we describe a systematic design pipeline and illustrate design for six broad design problems using recently developed tools for graph-partitioning and fragment assembly (F-RAG). Following partitioning of the target graph, corresponding atomic fragments from our RAG-3D database are combined using F-RAG, and the candidate atomic models are scored using a knowledge-based potential developed for 3D structure prediction. The sequences of the top scoring models are screened further using available tools for 2D structure prediction. The results indicate that our modular approach based on RNA-like topologies rather than specific 2D structures allows for greater flexibility in the design process, and generates a large number of candidate sequences quickly. Experimental structure probing using SHAPE-MaP for two sequences agree with our predictions and suggest that our combined tools yield excellent candidates for further sequence and experimental screening. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - High-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP, also called CLIP-Seq) has been used to map global RNA–protein interactions. However, a critical caveat of HITS-CLIP results is that they contain nonlinear background noise––different extent of nonspecific interactions caused by individual transcript abundance––that has been inconsiderately normalized, resulting in sacrifice of sensitivity. To properly deconvolute RNA–protein interactions, we have implemented CLIPick, a flexible peak calling pipeline for analyzing HITS-CLIP data, which statistically determines the signal-to-noise ratio for each transcript based on the expression-dependent background simulation. Comprising of streamlined Python modules with an easy-to-use standalone graphical user interface, CLIPick robustly identifies significant peaks and quantitatively defines footprint regions within which RNA–protein interactions were occurred. CLIPick outperforms other peak callers in accuracy and sensitivity, selecting the largest number of peaks particularly in lowly expressed transcripts where such marginal signals are hard to discriminate. Specifically, the application of CLIPick to Argonaute (Ago) HITS-CLIP data were sensitive enough to uncover extended features of microRNA target sites, and these sites were experimentally validated. CLIPick enables to resolve critical interactions in a wide spectrum of transcript levels and extends the scope of HITS-CLIP analysis. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) carries not only well-conserved protein coding, tRNA and rRNA genes, but also highly variable non-coding regions (NCRs). However, the NCRs show poor conservation across species, making their function and evolution elusive. Identification and functional characterization of NCRs across species would be critical for addressing these questions. To this end, we devised a computational pipeline and performed de novo assembly and annotation of mtDNA from 19 Caenorhabditis species using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The mtDNAs for 14 out of the 19 species are reported for the first time. Comparison of the 19 genomes reveals species-specific sampling of partial displacement-loop (D-loop) sequence as a novel NCR inserted into a unique tRNA cluster, suggesting an important role of the D-loop and the tRNA cluster in shaping NCR evolution. Intriguingly, RNA-Seq analysis suggests that a novel NCR resulting from a recent duplication of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) could be utilized as a 3' UTR for up-regulation of its upstream gene. The expression analysis shows a species- and sex-specific expression of mitochondrial genes encoded by mtDNA and nucleus, respectively. Our analyses provide important insights into the function and evolution of mitochondrial NCRs and pave the way for further studying the function and evolution of mitochondrial genome. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - To comprehensively study extracellular small RNAs (sRNA) by sequencing (sRNA-seq), we developed a novel pipeline to overcome current limitations in analysis entitled, “Tools for Integrative Genome analysis of Extracellular sRNAs (TIGER)”. To demonstrate the power of this tool, sRNA-seq was performed on mouse lipoproteins, bile, urine and livers. A key advance for the TIGER pipeline is the ability to analyse both host and non-host sRNAs at genomic, parent RNA and individual fragment levels. TIGER was able to identify approximately 60% of sRNAs on lipoproteins and >85% of sRNAs in liver, bile and urine, a significant advance compared to existing software. Moreover, TIGER facilitated the comparison of lipoprotein sRNA signatures to disparate sample types at each level using hierarchical clustering, correlations, beta-dispersions, principal coordinate analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance. TIGER analysis was also used to quantify distinct features of exRNAs, including 5ʹ miRNA variants, 3ʹ miRNA non-templated additions and parent RNA positional coverage. Results suggest that the majority of sRNAs on lipoproteins are non-host sRNAs derived from bacterial sources in the microbiome and environment, specifically rRNA-derived sRNAs from Proteobacteria. Collectively, TIGER facilitated novel discoveries of lipoprotein and biofluid sRNAs and has tremendous applicability for the field of extracellular RNA. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In genetic data modeling, the use of a limited number of samples for modeling and predicting, especially well below the attribute number, is difficult due to the enormous number of genes detected by a sequencing platform. In addition, many studies commonly use machine learning methods to evaluate genetic datasets to identify potential disease-related genes and drug targets, but to the best of our knowledge, the information associated with the selected gene set was not thoroughly elucidated in previous studies. To identify a relatively stable scheme for modeling limited samples in the gene datasets and reveal the information that they contain, the present study first evaluated the performance of a series of modeling approaches for predicting clinical endpoints of cancer and later integrated the results using various voting protocols. As a result, we proposed a relatively stable scheme that used a set of methods with an ensemble algorithm. Our findings indicated that the ensemble methodologies are more reliable for predicting cancer prognoses than single machine learning algorithms as well as for gene function evaluating. The ensemble methodologies provide a more complete coverage of relevant genes, which can facilitate the exploration of cancer mechanisms and the identification of potential drug targets. © 2018 Runyu Jing et al.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism is complex and it is unclear. Genetic testing such as microarray or sequencing was widely used to identify autism markers, but they are unsuccessful in several cases. The objective of this study is to identify causative variants of autism in two Thai families by using whole-exome sequencing technique. Whole-exome sequencing was performed with autism-affected children from two unrelated families. Each sample was sequenced on SOLiD 5500xl Genetic Analyzer system followed by combined bioinformatics pipeline including annotation and filtering process to identify candidate variants. Candidate variants were validated, and the segregation study with other family members was performed using Sanger sequencing. This study identified a possible causative variant for ASD, c.2951G>A, in the FGD6 gene. We demonstrated the potential for ASD genetic variants associated with ASD using whole-exome sequencing and a bioinformatics filtering procedure. These techniques could be useful in identifying possible causative ASD variants, especially in cases in which variants cannot be identified by other techniques. © 2018 Chuphong Thongnak et al.

AB  - Approximately 10% of breast cancer (BC) incidence is attributed to inherited germ-line mutations in tumor suppressor genes, and about a half of all hereditary BC cases remain unexplained by known genetic determinants. Whole exome sequencing (WES) offers great promise for the identification of novel hereditary cancer genes, however the interpretation of disease-causing significance for newly identified variants presents a challenge. Here we present the results of WES analysis of 32 hereditary BC patients with unknown causative mutations. In total, 52070 germ-line genetic variants were identified. We designed a special selection algorithm, which uses a sequence of filtering steps for highlighting probably pathogenic mutations. The pipeline is capable to compute minor allele frequencies (MAF) based on public databases; to estimate the potential pathogenicity of mutation according to CADD-database; to summarize the data regarding the gene functions, its pattern of expression and protein interactions networks. As a result we assembled the list of 245 potentially deleterious germ-line mutations probably associated with increased risk of BC. Some of these variants were validated in a case-control study. For example, homozygous missense substitution BRCA1 p.Gln356Arg was detected in 0.9% of consecutive BC cases; it was associated with 7-fold increased BC risk (95 % CI: 0.83-54.83). This finding supports the existence of recessive inheritance of breast cancer predisposition. © 2018 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder affecting the ocular, skeletal and cardiovascular systems. Previous studies of MFS have demonstrated the association between genetic defects and clinical manifestations. Our purpose was to investigate the role of novel genetic variants in determining MFS clinical phenotypes. Methods: We sequenced the whole exome of 19 individuals derived from three Han Chinese families. The sequencing data were analyzed by a standard pipeline. Variants were further filtered against the public database and an in-house database. Then, we performed pedigree analysis under different inheritance patterns according to American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. Results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Two novel loss-of-function indels (c.5027_5028insTGTCCTCC, p.D1677Vfs8; c.5856delG, p.S1953Lfs27) and one nonsense variant (c.8034C>A, p.Y2678) of FBN1 were identified in Family 1, Family 2 and Family 3, respectively. All affected members carried pathogenic mutations, whereas other unaffected family members or control individuals did not. These different kinds of loss of function (LOF) variants of FBN1 were located in the cbEGF region and a conserved domain across species and were not reported previously. Conclusions: Our study extended and strengthened the vital role of FBN1 LOF mutations in the pathogenesis of MFS with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. We confirm that genetic testing by next-generation sequencing of blood DNA can be fundamental in helping clinicians conduct mutation-based pre- and postnatal screening, genetic diagnosis and clinical management for MFS. © 2018 Pu et al.

AB  - Next generation sequencing (NGS) has traditionally been performed in various fields including agricultural to clinical and there are so many sequencing platforms available in order to obtain accurate and consistent results. However, these platforms showed amplification bias when facilitating variant calls in personal genomes. Here, we sequenced whole genomes and whole exomes from ten Korean individuals using Illumina and Ion Proton, respectively to find the vulnerability and accuracy of NGS platform in the GC rich/poor area. Overall, a total of 1013 Gb reads from Illumina and ~39.1 Gb reads from Ion Proton were analyzed using BWA-GATK variant calling pipeline. Furthermore, conjunction with the VQSR tool and detailed filtering strategies, we achieved high-quality variants. Finally, each of the ten variants from Illumina only, Ion Proton only, and intersection was selected for Sanger validation. The validation results revealed that Illumina platform showed higher accuracy than Ion Proton. The described filtering methods are advantageous for large population-based whole genome studies designed to identify common and rare variations associated with complex diseases. © 2017, The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - We introduce a k-mer-based computational protocol, DE-kupl, for capturing local RNA variation in a set of RNA-seq libraries, independently of a reference genome or transcriptome. DE-kupl extracts all k-mers with differential abundance directly from the raw data files. This enables the retrieval of virtually all variation present in an RNA-seq data set. This variation is subsequently assigned to biological events or entities such as differential long non-coding RNAs, splice and polyadenylation variants, introns, repeats, editing or mutation events, and exogenous RNA. Applying DE-kupl to human RNA-seq data sets identified multiple types of novel events, reproducibly across independent RNA-seq experiments. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: In current statistical methods for calling differentially expressed genes in RNA-Seq experiments, the assumption is that an adjusted observed gene count represents an unknown true gene count. This adjustment usually consists of a normalization step to account for heterogeneous sample library sizes, and then the resulting normalized gene counts are used as input for parametric or non-parametric differential gene expression tests. A distribution of true gene counts, each with a different probability, can result in the same observed gene count. Importantly, sequencing coverage information is currently not explicitly incorporated into any of the statistical models used for RNA-Seq analysis. Results: We developed a fast Bayesian method which uses the sequencing coverage information determined from the concentration of an RNA sample to estimate the posterior distribution of a true gene count. Our method has better or comparable performance compared to NOISeq and GFOLD, according to the results from simulations and experiments with real unreplicated data. We incorporated a previously unused sequencing coverage parameter into a procedure for differential gene expression analysis with RNA-Seq data. Conclusions: Our results suggest that our method can be used to overcome analytical bottlenecks in experiments with limited number of replicates and low sequencing coverage. The method is implemented in CORNAS (Coverage-dependent RNA-Seq), and is available at https://github.com/joel-lzb/CORNAS. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Sessile serrated adenomas/polyps are distinguished from hyperplastic colonic polyps subjectively by their endoscopic appearance and histological morphology. However, hyperplastic and sessile serrated polyps can have overlapping morphological features resulting in sessile serrated polyps diagnosed as hyperplastic. While sessile serrated polyps can progress into colon cancer, hyperplastic polyps have virtually no risk for colon cancer. Objective measures, differentiating these types of polyps would improve cancer prevention and treatment outcome. Methods: RNA-seq training data set and Affimetrix, Illumina testing data sets were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). RNA-seq single-end reads were filtered with FastX toolkit. Read mapping to the human genome, gene abundance estimation, and differential expression analysis were performed with Tophat-Cufflinks pipeline. Background correction, normalization, and probe summarization steps for Affimetrix arrays were performed using the robust multi-array method (RMA). For Illumina arrays, log2-scale expression data was obtained from GEO. Pathway analysis was implemented using Bioconductor package GSAR. To build a platform-independent molecular classifier that accurately differentiates sessile serrated and hyperplastic polyps we developed a new feature selection step. We also developed a simple procedure to classify new samples as either sessile serrated or hyperplastic with a class probability assigned to the decision, estimated using Cantelli's inequality. Results: The classifier trained on RNA-seq data and tested on two independent microarray data sets resulted in zero and three errors. The classifier was further tested using quantitative real-time PCR expression levels of 45 blinded independent formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens and was highly accurate. Pathway analyses have shown that sessile serrated polyps are distinguished from hyperplastic polyps and normal controls by: up-regulation of pathways implicated in proliferation, inflammation, cell-cell adhesion and down-regulation of serine threonine kinase signaling pathway; differential co-expression of pathways regulating cell division, protein trafficking and kinase activities. Conclusions: Most of the differentially expressed pathways are known as hallmarks of cancer and likely to explain why sessile serrated polyps are more prone to neoplastic transformation than hyperplastic. The new molecular classifier includes 13 genes and may facilitate objective differentiation between two polyps. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Endometrial cancers (ECs) are one of the most common types of malignant tumor in females. Substantial efforts had been made to identify significantly mutated genes (SMGs) in ECs and use them as biomarkers for the classification of histological subtypes and the prediction of clinical outcomes. However, the impact of non-significantly mutated genes (non-SMGs), which may also play important roles in the prognosis of EC patients, has not been extensively studied. Therefore, it is essential for the discovery of biomarkers in ECs to further investigate the non-SMGs that were highly associated with clinical outcomes. Results: For the 9681 non-SMGs reported by the mutation annotation pipeline, there were 1053, 1273 and 395 non-SMGs differentially expressed between the patient groups divided by the clinical endpoints of histological grade, histological type as well as the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage of ECs, respectively. In the gene set enrichment analysis, the cancer-related pathways, namely neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway, were significantly enriched with the differentially expressed non-SMGs for all the three endpoints. We further identified 23, 19 and 24 non-SMGs, which were highly associated with histological grade, histological type and FIGO stage, respectively, from the differentially expressed non-SMGs by using the variable combination population analysis (VCPA) approach and found that 69.6% (16/23), 78.9% (15/19) and 66.7% (16/24) of the identified non-SMGs had been previously reported to be correlated with cancers. In addition, the averaged areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) achieved by the predictive models with identified non-SMGs as predictors in predicting histological type, histological grade, and FIGO stage were 0.993, 0.961 and 0.832, respectively, which were superior to those achieved by the models with SMGs as features (averaged AUCs = 0.928, 0.864 and 0.535, resp.). Conclusions: Besides the SMGs, the non-SMGs reported in the mutation annotation analysis may also involve the crucial genes that were highly associated with clinical outcomes. Combining the mutation status with the gene expression profiles can efficiently identify the cancer-related non-SMGs as predictors for cancer prognostic prediction and provide more supplemental candidates for the discovery of biomarkers. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Integrating rare variation from trio family and case-control studies has successfully implicated specific genes contributing to risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), developmental disorders (DDs), and epilepsy (EPI). For schizophrenia (SCZ), however, while sets of genes have been implicated through the study of rare variation, only two risk genes have been identified. Methods: We used hierarchical Bayesian modeling of rare-variant genetic architecture to estimate mean effect sizes and risk-gene proportions, analyzing the largest available collection of whole exome sequence data for SCZ (1,077 trios, 6,699 cases, and 13,028 controls), and data for four NDDs (ASD, ID, DD, and EPI; total 10,792 trios, and 4,058 cases and controls). Results: For SCZ, we estimate there are 1,551 risk genes. There are more risk genes and they have weaker effects than for NDDs. We provide power analyses to predict the number of risk-gene discoveries as more data become available. We confirm and augment prior risk gene and gene set enrichment results for SCZ and NDDs. In particular, we detected 98 new DD risk genes at FDR < 0.05. Correlations of risk-gene posterior probabilities are high across four NDDs (ρ >0.55), but low between SCZ and the NDDs (ρ <0.3). An in-depth analysis of 288 NDD genes shows there is highly significant protein-protein interaction (PPI) network connectivity, and functionally distinct PPI subnetworks based on pathway enrichment, single-cell RNA-seq cell types, and multi-region developmental brain RNA-seq. Conclusions: We have extended a pipeline used in ASD studies and applied it to infer rare genetic parameters for SCZ and four NDDs ( https://github.com/hoangtn/extTADA ). We find many new DD risk genes, supported by gene set enrichment and PPI network connectivity analyses. We find greater similarity among NDDs than between NDDs and SCZ. NDD gene subnetworks are implicated in postnatally expressed presynaptic and postsynaptic genes, and for transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation in prenatal neural progenitor and stem cells. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Transcriptomic profiling of ex vivo cultured human limbal epithelial stem cells (hLESCs) will foster better understanding of corneal physiology and novel treatment paradigms to limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). However, currently such profiling studies are hampered due to difficulties with producing sufficient amounts of intact mRNA for deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from subpopulations sorted on the basis of co-expression of membrane and intracellular antigens by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Methods: To address this problem, we systematically analyzed the critical steps, and found that ethanol fixation together with optimized downstream procedures provided a pipeline that yielded high quality total RNA in amounts to readily support the RNA-seq procedure, while still preserving good discrimination between the individual hLESC immunophenotypes. Results: The average RNA integrity number (RIN) was 7.7 ± 0.4, and the average yield was 4.6 ± 1.7 pg of RNA per cell. The sequencing analysis of the isolated RNA produced high quality data with more than 70% of read pairs mapping uniformly to the reference genome and 80% of bases with a Phred score of at least 30. Conclusion: In this study, we developed a reliable FACS-based procedure using ethanol as a fixative that would support accurate isolation of limbal epithelial progenitor subpopulations along with RNA yield and quality sufficient to enable deep transcriptomic profiling. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Gene functionality is closely connected to its expression specificity across tissues and cell types. RNA-Seq is a powerful quantitative tool to explore genome wide expression. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive RNA-Seq dataset across the same 13 tissues for mouse and rat, two of the most relevant species for biomedical research. The dataset provides the transcriptome across tissues from three male C57BL6 mice and three male Han Wistar rats. We also describe our bioinformatics pipeline to process and technically validate the data. Principal component analysis shows that tissue samples from both species cluster similarly. We show by comparative genomics that many genes with high sequence identity with respect to their human orthologues also have a highly correlated tissue distribution profile and are in agreement with manually curated literature data for human. In summary, the present study provides a unique resource for comparative genomics and will facilitate the analysis of tissue specificity and cross-species conservation in higher organisms.

AB  - Purpose: Children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) whose disease is refractory to standard induction chemotherapy therapy or who experience relapse after initial response have dismal outcomes. We sought to comprehensively profile pediatric AML microRNA (miRNA) samples to identify dysregulated genes and assess the utility of miRNAs for improved outcome prediction. Patients and Methods: To identify miRNA biomarkers that are associated with treatment failure, we performed a comprehensive sequence-based characterization of the pediatric AML miRNA landscape. miRNA sequencing was performed on 1,362 samples-1,303 primary, 22 refractory, and 37 relapse samples. One hundred sixty-four matched samples-127 primary and 37 relapse samples-were analyzed by using RNA sequencing. Results: By using penalized lasso Cox proportional hazards regression, we identified 36 miRNAs the expression levels at diagnosis of which were highly associated with event-free survival. Combined expression of the 36 miRNAs was used to create a novel miRNA-based risk classification scheme (AMLmiR36). This new miRNA-based risk classifier identifies those patients who are at high risk (hazard ratio, 2.830; P ≤.001) or low risk (hazard ratio, 0.323; P ≤.001) of experiencing treatment failure, independent of conventional karyotype or mutation status. The performance of AMLmiR36 was independently assessed by using 878 patients from two different clinical trials (AAML0531 and AAML1031). Our analysis also revealed that miR-106a-363 was abundantly expressed in relapse and refractory samples, and several candidate targets of miR-106a-5p were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, a process that is suppressed in treatment-resistant leukemic cells. Conclusion: To assess the utility of miRNAs for outcome prediction in patients with pediatric AML, we designed and validated a miRNA-based risk classification scheme. We also hypothesized that the abundant expression of miR-106a could increase treatment resistance via modulation of genes that are involved in oxidative phosphorylation. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing technique (RNA-seq) enables scientists to develop novel data-driven methods for discovering more unidentified lincRNAs. Meantime, knowledge-based technologies are experiencing a potential revolution ignited by the new deep learning methods. By scanning the newly found data set from RNA-seq, scientists have found that: (1) the expression of lincRNAs appears to be regulated, that is, the relevance exists along the DNA sequences; (2) lincRNAs contain some conversed patterns/motifs tethered together by non-conserved regions. The two evidences give the reasoning for adopting knowledge-based deep learning methods in lincRNA detection. Similar to coding region transcription, non-coding regions are split at transcriptional sites. However, regulatory RNAs rather than message RNAs are generated. That is, the transcribed RNAs participate the biological process as regulatory units instead of generating proteins. Identifying these transcriptional regions from non-coding regions is the first step towards lincRNA recognition.
RESULTS: The auto-encoder method achieves 100% and 92.4% prediction accuracy on transcription sites over the putative data sets. The experimental results also show the excellent performance of predictive deep neural network on the lincRNA data sets compared with support vector machine and traditional neural network. In addition, it is validated through the newly discovered lincRNA data set and one unreported transcription site is found by feeding the whole annotated sequences through the deep learning machine, which indicates that deep learning method has the extensive ability for lincRNA prediction.
CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptional sequences of lincRNAs are collected from the annotated human DNA genome data. Subsequently, a two-layer deep neural network is developed for the lincRNA detection, which adopts the auto-encoder algorithm and utilizes different encoding schemes to obtain the best performance over intergenic DNA sequence data. Driven by those newly annotated lincRNA data, deep learning methods based on auto-encoder algorithm can exert their capability in knowledge learning in order to capture the useful features and the information correlation along DNA genome sequences for lincRNA detection. As our knowledge, this is the first application to adopt the deep learning techniques for identifying lincRNA transcription sequences.

AB  - Background: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is an increasingly popular platform to study heterogeneity at the single-cell level. Computational methods to process scRNA-Seq data are not very accessible to bench scientists as they require a significant amount of bioinformatic skills. Results: We have developed Granatum, a web-based scRNA-Seq analysis pipeline to make analysis more broadly accessible to researchers. Without a single line of programming code, users can click through the pipeline, setting parameters and visualizing results via the interactive graphical interface. Granatum conveniently walks users through various steps of scRNA-Seq analysis. It has a comprehensive list of modules, including plate merging and batch-effect removal, outlier-sample removal, gene-expression normalization, imputation, gene filtering, cell clustering, differential gene expression analysis, pathway/ontology enrichment analysis, protein network interaction visualization, and pseudo-time cell series construction. Conclusions: Granatum enables broad adoption of scRNA-Seq technology by empowering bench scientists with an easy-to-use graphical interface for scRNA-Seq data analysis.

AB  - Background: The technological advances of RNA-seq and de novo transcriptome assembly have enabled genome annotation and transcriptome profiling in highly heterozygous species such as grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). This work is an attempt to utilize a de novo-assembled transcriptome of the V. vinifera cultivar 'Riesling' to improve annotation of the grapevine reference genome sequence. Results: Here we show that the transcriptome assembly of a single V. vinifera cultivar is insufficient for a complete genome annotation of the grapevine reference genome constructed from V. vinifera PN40024. Further, we provide evidence that the gene models we identified cannot be completely anchored to the previously published V. vinifera PN40024 gene models. In addition to these findings, we present a computational pipeline for the de novo identification of lncRNAs. Our results demonstrate that, in grapevine, lncRNAs are significantly different from protein coding transcripts in such metrics as length, GC-content, minimum free energy, and length-corrected minimum free energy. Conclusions: In grapevine, high-level heterozygosity necessitates that transcriptome characterization be based on cultivar-specific reference genome sequences. Our results strengthen the hypothesis that lncRNAs have thermodynamically different properties than protein-coding RNAs. The analyses of both coding and non-coding RNAs will be instrumental in uncovering inter-cultivar variation in wild and cultivated grapevine species. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The pathogenesis of neuropathic pain (NP) is characterized by an increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the nervous system. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the NP still remain elusive. Recent data suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate expression of NP-associated genes. Herein, we analyzed lncRNAs and mRNA profiles in the spinal cord of rats by RNA sequencing during the progression of NP in a spared nerve injury (SNI) model. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were employed for the establishment of the SNI models, and nociceptive responses to mechanical and thermal stimuli were measured 3 hours prior to surgery and on postoperative days 1, 3, 7 and 14, with L4-5 spinal cords extracted from three SD rats under deep anesthesia at each time point after behavioral test. SNI rats exhibited higher sensitivity to mechanical stimuli from days 1 to 14. Mechanical hyperalgesia reached a steady peak at day14 after surgery, whereas thermal allodynia did not develop. The results of second-generation sequencing suggested that the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs were significantly altered in spinal cords of SNI rats versus the control rats at different stages during NP. Differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs were demonstrated at each stage during the NP course using Volcano Plot, Venn and Hcluster heatmap analyses. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) biological pathway analyses were performed to predict the functionalities of differentially expressed lncRNAs and target genes. Protein interaction networks were constructed based on the correlation analyses of DE lncRNA target proteins at 7 and 14 days after SNI, respectively. Taken together, our results revealed the profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in the rat spinal cord under an NP condition. These lncRNAs and mRNAs may represent new therapeutic targets for the treatment of NP. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is an essential technique for transcriptome studies, hundreds of analysis tools have been developed since it was debuted. Although recent efforts have attempted to assess the latest available tools, they have not evaluated the analysis workflows comprehensively to unleash the power within RNA-seq. Here we conduct an extensive study analysing a broad spectrum of RNA-seq workflows. Surpassing the expression analysis scope, our work also includes assessment of RNA variant-calling, RNA editing and RNA fusion detection techniques. Specifically, we examine both short-A nd long-read RNA-seq technologies, 39 analysis tools resulting in ~120 combinations, and 490 analyses involving 15 samples with a variety of germline, cancer and stem cell data sets. We report the performance and propose a comprehensive RNA-seq analysis protocol, named RNACocktail, along with a computational pipeline achieving high accuracy. Validation on different samples reveals that our proposed protocol could help researchers extract more biologically relevant predictions by broad analysis of the transcriptome. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - One of the problems of de novo assembly is the occurrence of artifactual direct or inverted repeats that are mainly formed by misassembly of short sequencing reads and cannot be differentiated from real sequence repeats. In this study, we compared the frequency of artifactual repeats generated by four de novo assembly pipelines: (1) Velvet-Oases-The Gene Index Clustering Tool (TGICL), (2) Velvet-TGICL, (3) Trinity-TGICL and (4) SOAPdenovo-Trans‑TGICL by analysing the RNA-Seq data of Gracilaria changii. The overall completeness of these four de novo assemblies were in the range of 85.2–90.0% for complete Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs), with the Velvet-TGICL assembly having the highest percentage of single copy and complete BUSCOs (78.9%). When Velvet-Oases-TGICL was used, a total of 2510 (8.44%) direct and 1967 (6.61%) inverted artifactual repeats were found among the assembled sequences. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of 15 unigenes containing direct or inverted repeats confirmed that the repeats were due to assembly artifacts. When Oases was omitted from the assembly pipeline (i.e. Vetvet-TGICL), the number of unigenes containing artifactual direct and inverted repeats reduced significantly to 238 (1.63%) and 8 (0.06%), respectively. Among the four de novo assemblies, the Velvet-Oases-TGICL and Velvet-TGICL assemblies had the highest and the lower percentage of unigene containing artifactual repeats, respectively. The occurrence of artifactual repeats in the transcriptome data may complicate downstream analyses such as identification of splice variants and gene fusion, but the differential gene expression was less affected by the presence of artifactual repeats in this study. The information provided in this paper (based on a non-model seaweed G. changii) could be useful for designing and optimizing assembly pipeline for future analysis of RNA-Seq data from organisms without a reference genome. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are pervasively expressed circles of non-coding RNAs. Even though many circRNAs have been reported in humans, their expression patterns and functions remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed a pipeline named RAISE to detect circRNAs in RNA-seq data. RAISE can fully characterize circRNA structure and abundance. We evaluated inter-individual variations in circRNA expression in humans by applying this pipeline to numerous non-poly(A)-selected RNA-seq data. We identified 59,128 circRNA candidates in 61 human liver samples, with almost no overlap in the circRNA of the recruited samples. Approximately 89% of the circRNAs were detected in one or two samples. In comparison, 10% of the linear mRNAs and non-coding RNAs were detected in each sample. We estimated the variation in other tissues, especially the circRNA highabundance tissues, in advance. Only 0.5% of the 50,631 brain circRNA candidates were shared among the 30 recruited brain samples, which is similar to the proportion in liver. Moreover, we found inter-and intra-individual diversity in circRNAs expression in the granulocyte RNA-seq data from seven individuals sampled 3 times at one-month intervals. Our findings suggest that careful consideration of inter-individual diversity is required when extensively identifying human circRNAs or proposing their use as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in disease.

AB  - Chromatin alterations mediate mutations and gene expression changes in cancer. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has been utilized to study genome-wide chromatin structure in human cancer cell lines, yet numerous technical challenges limit comparable analyses in primary tumors. Here we have developed a new whole-genome analytic pipeline to optimize ChIP-Seq protocols on patient-derived xenografts from human papillomavirus–related (HPVþ) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples. We further associated chromatin aberrations with gene expression changes from a larger cohort of the tumor and normal samples with RNA-Seq data. We detect differential histone enrichment associated with tumor-specific gene expression variation, sites of HPV integration in the human genome, and HPV-associated histone enrichment sites upstream of cancer driver genes, which play central roles in cancer-associated pathways. These comprehensive analyses enable unprecedented characterization of the complex network of molecular changes resulting from chromatin alterations that drive HPV-related tumorigenesis. ©2017 AACR.

AB  - Genetic association mapping produces statistical links between phenotypes and genomic regions, but identifying causal variants remains difficult. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can help by providing complete knowledge of all genetic variants, but it is financially prohibitive for well-powered GWAS studies. We performed mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with WGS and RNA-seq, and found that lead eQTL variants called with WGS were more likely to be causal. Through simulations, we derived properties of causal variants and used them to develop a method for identifying likely causal SNPs. We estimated that 25-70% of causal variants were located in open-chromatin regions, depending on the tissue and experiment. Finally, we identified a set of high-confidence causal variants and showed that these were more enriched in GWAS associations than other eQTLs. Of those, we found 65 associations with GWAS traits and provide examples in which genes implicated by expression are functionally validated as being relevant for complex traits. © 2017 Nature America, Inc.

AB  - Although many tools have been developed to analyze small RNA sequencing (sRNA-Seq) data, it remains challenging to accurately analyze the small RNA population, mainly due to multiple sequence ID assignment caused by short read length. Additional issues in small RNA analysis include low consistency of microRNA (miRNA) measurement results across different platforms, miRNA mapping associated with miRNA sequence variation (isomiR) and RNA editing, and the origin of those unmapped reads after screening against all endogenous reference sequence databases. To address these issues, we built a comprehensive and customizable sRNA-Seq data analysis pipeline-sRNAnalyzer, which enables: (i) comprehensive miRNA profiling strategies to better handle isomiRs and summarization based on each nucleotide position to detect potential SNPs in miRNAs, (ii) different sequence mapping result assignment approaches to simulate results from microarray/qRT-PCR platforms and a local probabilistic model to assign mapping results to the mostlikely IDs, (iii) comprehensive ribosomal RNA filtering for accurate mapping of exogenous RNAs and summarization based on taxonomy annotation. We evaluated our pipeline on both artificial samples (including synthetic miRNA and Escherichia coli cultures) and biological samples (human tissue and plasma). sRNAnalyzer is implemented in Perl and available at: http://srnanalyzer.systemsbiology.net/. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Numerous RNAs are enriched within cellular protrusions, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We had shown that the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) protein controls localization of some RNAs at protrusions. Here, using protrusion-isolation schemes and RNA-Seq, we find that RNAs localized in protrusions of migrating fibroblasts can be distinguished in two groups, which are differentially enriched in distinct types of protrusions, and are additionally differentially dependent on APC. APC-dependent RNAs become enriched in high-contractility protrusions and, accordingly, their localization is promoted by increasing stiffness of the extracellular matrix. Dissecting the underlying mechanism, we show that actomyosin contractility activates a RhoA-mDia1 signaling pathway that leads to formation of a detyrosinated-microtubule network, which in turn is required for localization of APC-dependent RNAs. Importantly, a competition-based approach to specifically mislocalize APC-dependent RNAs suggests that localization of the APC-dependent RNA subgroup is functionally important for cell migration. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Acute gastric lesions induced by stress are frequent occurrences in medical establishments. The gastric dramatic downrelated gene (GDDR) is a secreted protein, which is abundantly expressed in normal gastric epithelia and is significantly decreased in gastric cancer. In our previous study, it was found that GDDR aggravated stress-induced acute gastric lesions. However, the role of GDDR in acute gastric lesions remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, RNA sequencing was performed in order to examine the gene expression profile regulated by GDDR in acute gastric lesions. The dataset comprised four stomach samples from wild-type (WT) mice and four stomach samples from GDDR-knockout mice. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed to analyze the differentially-expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted correlation network analysis was used to identify clusters of highly correlated genes. Cytoscape was used to construct a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) of the DEGs. Based on the GO analysis, the upregulated DEGs were distinctly enriched in muscle contraction and response to wounding; and the downregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in the regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process and regulation of RNA metabolic process. The results of the KEGG pathway analysis showed that the upregulated DEGs were enriched in ECM-receptor interaction and the signaling pathway of cGMP-PKG, and the downregulated DEGs were enriched in the renin.angiotensin system and glycerolipid metabolism. The co-expression network revealed a group of genes, which were associated with increased wound healing in the WT mice. Significant pathways were identified through the PPI network, including negative regulation of the signaling pathway of glucocorticoid receptor, regulation of cellular stress response, and regulation of hormone secretion. In conclusion, the present study improves current understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying acute gastric lesions and may assist in the treatment of gastric lesions.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have detected association between variants in or near the Lysophospholipase-like 1 (LYPLAL1) locus and metabolic traits, including central obesity, fatty liver and waist-to-hip ratio. LYPLAL1 is also known to be upregulated in the adipose tissue of obese patients. However, the physiological role of LYPLAL1 is not understood. To investigate the function of Lyplal1 in vivo we investigated the phenotype of the Lyplal1tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi homozygous mouse. Body composition was unaltered in Lyplal1 knockout mice as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning, both on normal chow and on a high-fat diet. Adipose tissue distribution between visceral and subcutaneous fat depots was unaltered, with no change in adipocyte cell size. The response to both insulin and glucose dosing was normal in Lyplal1tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi homozygous mice, with normal fasting blood glucose concentrations. RNAseq analysis of liver, muscle and adipose tissue confirmed that Lyplal1 expression was ablated with minimal additional changes in gene expression. These results suggest that Lyplal1 is dispensable for normal mouse metabolic physiology and that despite having been maintained through evolution Lyplal1 is not an essential gene, suggesting possible functional redundancy. Further studies will be required to clarify its physiological role. © 2017. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - In an attempt to complete human proteome project (HPP), Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) launched the journey of missing protein (MP) investigation in 2012. However, 2579 and 572 protein entries in the neXtProt (2017-1) are still considered as missing and uncertain proteins, respectively. Thus, in this study, we proposed a pipeline to analyze, identify, and validate human missing and uncertain proteins in open-access transcriptomics and proteomics databases. Analysis of RNA expression pattern for missing proteins in Human protein Atlas showed that 28% of them, such as Olfactory receptor 1I1 (O60431), had no RNA expression, suggesting the necessity to consider uncommon tissues for transcriptomic and proteomic studies. Interestingly, 21% had elevated expression level in a particular tissue (tissue-enriched proteins), indicating the importance of targeting such proteins in their elevated tissues. Additionally, the analysis of RNA expression level for missing proteins showed that 95% had no or low expression level (0-10 transcripts per million), indicating that low abundance is one of the major obstacles facing the detection of missing proteins. Moreover, missing proteins are predicted to generate fewer predicted unique tryptic peptides than the identified proteins. Searching for these predicted unique tryptic peptides that correspond to missing and uncertain proteins in the experimental peptide list of open-access MS-based databases (PA, GPM) resulted in the detection of 402 missing and 19 uncertain proteins with at least two unique peptides (≥9 aa) at &lt;(5 × 10 -4 )% FDR. Finally, matching the native spectra for the experimentally detected peptides with their SRMAtlas synthetic counterparts at three transition sources (QQQ, QTOF, QTRAP) gave us an opportunity to validate 41 missing proteins by ≥2 proteotypic peptides. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Studies of innate glial cell responses for progressive human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) infection are limited by a dearth of human disease-relevant small-animal models. To overcome this obstacle, newborn NOD/SCID/IL2Rγc-/- (NSG) mice were reconstituted with a humanized brain and immune system. NSG animals of both sexes were transplanted with human neuroglial progenitor cells (NPCs) and hematopoietic stem cells. Intraventricular injection of NPCs symmetrically repopulated the mouse brain parenchyma with human astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Human glia were in periventricular areas, white matter tracts, the olfactory bulb and the brain stem. HIV-1 infection led to meningeal and perivascular human leukocyte infiltration into the brain. Species-specific viralneuroimmune interactionswere identified by deepRNA sequencing. In the corpus callosum and hippocampus of infected animals, overlapping human-specific transcriptional alterations for interferon type 1 and 2 signaling pathways (STAT1, STAT2, IRF9, ISG15, IFI6) and a range of host antiviral responses (MX1, OAS1, RSAD2, BST2, SAMHD1) were observed. Glial cytoskeleton reorganization, oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin ensheathment (MBP, MOBP, PLP1, MAG, ZNF488) were downregulated. The data sets were confirmed by real-time PCR. These viral defense-signaling patterns paralleled neuroimmune communication networks seen in HIV-1-infected human brains. In this manner, this new mousemodel of neuroAIDS can facilitate diagnostic, therapeutic and viral eradication strategies for an infected nervous system. © 2017.

AB  - Background - Familial Ebstein anomaly is a rare form of congenital heart disease. We report 7 individuals among 2 generations of 1 family with Ebstein anomaly. This family was first reported in 1991 by Balaji et al in which family members were also reported to have a mild skeletal phenotype. The most likely mechanism of inheritance was concluded to be autosomal dominant. We sought to identify the genetic pathogenesis in this family using a next generation sequencing approach. Methods and Results - Whole exome sequencing was performed in 2 cousins in this family using the Agilent SureSelect Human all Exon 51 Mb version 5 capture kit. Data were processed through an analytic in-house pipeline. Whole exome sequencing identified a missense mutation in FLNA (Filamin A), an actin-binding protein located at Xq28, mutations in which are associated with the skeletal phenotypes Frontometaphyseal dysplasia, Otopalatodigital, and Melnick-Needles syndrome, with X-linked periventricular nodular heterotopia and FG syndrome (Omim, 305450). Review of the phenotypes of those with the mutation in this family shows increased severity of the cardiac phenotype and associated skeletal features in affected males, consistent with X-linked inheritance. Conclusions - Although congenital heart disease is reported in families with mutations in FLNA, this is the first report of individuals being affected by Ebstein anomaly because of a mutation in this gene and details the concurrent skeletal phenotype observed in this family. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - Exome sequencing is becoming widely popular and affordable, making it one of the most desirable methods for the identification of rare genetic variants for clinical diagnosis. Here, we report the clinical application of whole exome sequencing for the ultimate diagnosis of a ciliary chondrodysplasia case presented with an initial clinical diagnosis of Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy (ATD, Jeune Syndrome). We have identified a novel homozygous missense mutation in WDR35 (c.206G > A), a gene previously associated with Sensenbrenner Syndrome, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome and Short-rib polydactyly syndrome type V. The genetic findings in this family led to the re-evaluation of the initial diagnosis and a differential diagnosis of Sensenbrenner Syndrome was made after cautious re-examination of the patient. Cell culture studies revealed normal subcellular localization of the mutant WDR35 protein in comparison to wildtype protein, pointing towards impaired protein-protein interaction and/or altered cell signaling pathways as a consequence of the mutated allele. This research study highlights the importance of including pathogenic variant identification in the diagnosis pipeline of ciliary chondrodysplasias, especially for clinically not fully defined phenotypes. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Background: Nowadays, many public repositories containing large microarray gene expression datasets are available. However, the problem lies in the fact that microarray technology are less powerful and accurate than more recent Next Generation Sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq. In any case, information from microarrays is truthful and robust, thus it can be exploited through the integration of microarray data with RNA-Seq data. Additionally, information extraction and acquisition of large number of samples in RNA-Seq still entails very high costs in terms of time and computational resources.This paper proposes a new model to find the gene signature of breast cancer cell lines through the integration of heterogeneous data from different breast cancer datasets, obtained from microarray and RNA-Seq technologies. Consequently, data integration is expected to provide a more robust statistical significance to the results obtained. Finally, a classification method is proposed in order to test the robustness of the Differentially Expressed Genes when unseen data is presented for diagnosis. Results: The proposed data integration allows analyzing gene expression samples coming from different technologies. The most significant genes of the whole integrated data were obtained through the intersection of the three gene sets, corresponding to the identified expressed genes within the microarray data itself, within the RNA-Seq data itself, and within the integrated data from both technologies. This intersection reveals 98 possible technology-independent biomarkers. Two different heterogeneous datasets were distinguished for the classification tasks: a training dataset for gene expression identification and classifier validation, and a test dataset with unseen data for testing the classifier. Both of them achieved great classification accuracies, therefore confirming the validity of the obtained set of genes as possible biomarkers for breast cancer. Through a feature selection process, a final small subset made up by six genes was considered for breast cancer diagnosis. Conclusions: This work proposes a novel data integration stage in the traditional gene expression analysis pipeline through the combination of heterogeneous data from microarrays and RNA-Seq technologies. Available samples have been successfully classified using a subset of six genes obtained by a feature selection method. Consequently, a new classification and diagnosis tool was built and its performance was validated using previously unseen samples. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Genome-wide quantification of enhancer activity in the human genome has proven to be a challenging problem. Recent efforts have led to the development of powerful tools for enhancer quantification. However, because of genome size and complexity, these tools have yet to be applied to the whole human genome. Results: In the current study, we use a human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP as a model to perform whole human genome STARR-seq (WHG-STARR-seq) to reliably obtain an assessment of enhancer activity. This approach builds upon previously developed STARR-seq in the fly genome and CapSTARR-seq techniques in targeted human genomic regions. With an improved library preparation strategy, our approach greatly increases the library complexity per unit of starting material, which makes it feasible and cost-effective to explore the landscape of regulatory activity in the much larger human genome. In addition to our ability to identify active, accessible enhancers located in open chromatin regions, we can also detect sequences with the potential for enhancer activity that are located in inaccessible, closed chromatin regions. When treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A, genes nearby this latter class of enhancers are up-regulated, demonstrating the potential for endogenous functionality of these regulatory elements. Conclusion: WHG-STARR-seq provides an improved approach to current pipelines for analysis of high complexity genomes to gain a better understanding of the intricacies of transcriptional regulation. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Together, malaria and the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) kill more than 800,000 people annually, while creating long-term disability in millions more. International support for mass drug administration, bed nets, and other preventive measures has resulted in huge public health gains, while support for translational research is leading to the development of some new neglected disease drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines. However, funding for basic science research has not kept up, such that we are missing opportunities to create a more innovative pipeline of control tools for parasitic and related diseases. There is an urgent need to expand basic science approaches for neglected diseases, especially in the areas of systems biology and immunology; ecology, evolution, and mathematical biology; functional and comparative OMICs; gene editing; expanded use of model organisms; and a new single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing approach. The world’s poor deserve access to innovation for neglected diseases. It should be considered a fundamental human right. © 2017 Peter J. Hotez.

AB  - Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a lack of estrogen and progesterone receptor expression (ESR and PGR, respectively) and an absence of human epithelial growth factor receptor (ERBB2) amplification. Approximately 15-20% of breast malignancies are TNBC. Patients with TNBC often have an unfavorable prognosis. In addition, TNBC represents an important clinical challenge since it does not respond to hormone therapy. Methods: In this work, we integrated high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from normal and tumor tissues (obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA) and cell lines obtained through in-house sequencing or available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to generate a unified list of differentially expressed (DE) genes. Methylome and proteomic data were integrated to our analysis to give further support to our findings. Genes that were overexpressed in TNBC were then curated to retain new potentially druggable targets based on in silico analysis. Knocking-down was used to assess gene importance for TNBC cell proliferation. Results: Our pipeline analysis generated a list of 243 potential new targets for treating TNBC. We finally demonstrated that knock-down of Guanylate-Binding Protein 1 (GBP1 ), one of the candidate genes, selectively affected the growth of TNBC cell lines. Moreover, we showed that GBP1 expression was controlled by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in breast cancer cell lines. Conclusions: We propose that GBP1 is a new potential druggable therapeutic target for treating TNBC with enhanced EGFR expression. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The three prime untranslated region (3'-UTR) is known to play a pivotal role in modulating gene expression by determining the fate of mRNA. Many crucial developmental events, such as mammalian spermatogenesis, tissue patterning, sex determination and neurogenesis, rely heavily on post-transcriptional regulation by the 3'-UTR. However, 3'-UTR biology seems to be a relatively untapped field, with only limited tools and 3'-UTR resources available. To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of the 3'-UTR on gene expression, firstly the 3'-UTR sequences must be identified. Current 3'-UTR mining tools, such as GETUTR, 3USS and UTRscan, all depend on a well-annotated reference genome or curated 3'-UTR sequences, which hinders their application on a myriad of non-model organisms where the genomes are not available. To address these issues, the establishment of an NGS-based, automated pipeline is urgently needed for genome-wide 3'-UTR prediction in the absence of reference genomes. Results: Here, we propose ExUTR, a novel NGS-based pipeline to predict and retrieve 3'-UTR sequences from RNA-Seq experiments, particularly designed for non-model species lacking well-annotated genomes. This pipeline integrates cutting-edge bioinformatics tools, databases (Uniprot and UTRdb) and novel in-house Perl scripts, implementing a fully automated workflow. By taking transcriptome assemblies as inputs, this pipeline identifies 3'-UTR signals based primarily on the intrinsic features of transcripts, and outputs predicted 3'-UTR candidates together with associated annotations. In addition, ExUTR only requires minimal computational resources, which facilitates its implementation on a standard desktop computer with reasonable runtime, making it affordable to use for most laboratories. We also demonstrate the functionality and extensibility of this pipeline using publically available RNA-Seq data from both model and non-model species, and further validate the accuracy of predicted 3'-UTR using both well-characterized 3'-UTR resources and 3P-Seq data. Conclusions:ExUTR is a practical and powerful workflow that enables rapid genome-wide 3'-UTR discovery from NGS data. The candidates predicted through this pipeline will further advance the study of miRNA target prediction, cis elements in 3'-UTR and the evolution and biology of 3'-UTRs. Being independent of a well-annotated reference genome will dramatically expand its application to much broader research area, encompassing all species for which RNA-Seq is available. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: De novo transcriptome assembly is an important technique for understanding gene expression in non-model organisms. Many de novo assemblers using the de Bruijn graph of a set of the RNA sequences rely on in-memory representation of this graph. However, current methods analyse the complete set of read-derived k-mer sequence at once, resulting in the need for computer hardware with large shared memory. Results: We introduce a novel approach that clusters k-mers as the first step. The clusters correspond to small sets of gene products, which can be processed quickly to give candidate transcripts. We implement the clustering step using the MapReduce approach for parallelising the analysis of large datasets, which enables the use of compute clusters. The computational task is distributed across the compute system using the industry-standard MPI protocol, and no specialised hardware is required. Using this approach, we have re-implemented the Inchworm module from the widely used Trinity pipeline, and tested the method in the context of the full Trinity pipeline. Validation tests on a range of real datasets show large reductions in the runtime and per-node memory requirements, when making use of a compute cluster. Conclusions: Our study shows that MapReduce-based clustering has great potential for distributing challenging sequencing problems, without loss of accuracy. Although we have focussed on the Trinity package, we propose that such clustering is a useful initial step for other assembly pipelines. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Previous studies have prioritized trait-relevant cell types by looking for an enrichment of genome-wide association study (GWAS) signal within functional regions. However, these studies are limited in cell resolution by the lack of functional annotations from difficult-to-characterize or rare cell populations. Measurement of single-cell gene expression has become a popular method for characterizing novel cell types, and yet limited work has linked single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to phenotypes of interest. To address this deficiency, we present RolyPoly, a regression-based polygenic model that can prioritize trait-relevant cell types and genes from GWAS summary statistics and gene expression data. RolyPoly is designed to use expression data from either bulk tissue or single-cell RNA-seq. In this study, we demonstrated RolyPoly's accuracy through simulation and validated previously known tissue-trait associations. We discovered a significant association between microglia and late-onset Alzheimer disease and an association between schizophrenia and oligodendrocytes and replicating fetal cortical cells. Additionally, RolyPoly computes a trait-relevance score for each gene to reflect the importance of expression specific to a cell type. We found that differentially expressed genes in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with Alzheimer disease were significantly enriched with genes ranked highly by RolyPoly gene scores. Overall, our method represents a powerful framework for understanding the effect of common variants on cell types contributing to complex traits. © 2017 American Society of Human Genetics

AB  - Online sequence repositories are teeming with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from a wide range of eukaryotes. Although most of these data sets contain large numbers of organelle-derived reads, researchers tend to ignore these data, focusing instead on the nuclear-derived transcripts. Consequently, GenBank contains massive amounts of organelle RNA-Seq data that are just waiting to be downloaded and analyzed. Recently, a team of scientists designed an open-source bioinformatics program called ChloroSeq, which systemically analyzes an organelle transcriptome using RNA-Seq. The ChloroSeq pipeline uses RNA-Seq alignment data to deliver detailed analyses of organelle transcriptomes, which can be fed into statistical software for further analysis and for generating graphical representations of the data. In addition to providing data on expression levels via coverage statistics, ChloroSeq can examine splicing efficiency and RNA editing profiles. Ultimately, ChloroSeq provides a well-needed avenue for researchers of all stripes to start exploring organelle transcription and could be a key step toward a more thorough understanding of organelle gene expression. © The Author 2017.

AB  - The TomExpress platform was developed to provide the tomato research community with a browser and integrated web tools for public RNA-Seq data visualization and data mining. To avoid major biases that can result from the use of different mapping and statistical processing methods, RNA-Seq raw sequence data available in public databases were mapped de novo on a unique tomato reference genome sequence and post-processed using the same pipeline with accurate parameters. Following the calculation of the number of counts per gene in each RNA-Seq sample, a communal global normalization method was applied to all expression values. This unifies the whole set of expression data and makes them comparable. A database was designed where each expression value is associated with corresponding experimental annotations. Sample details were manually curated to be easily understandable by biologists. To make the data easily searchable, a user-friendly web interface was developed that provides versatile data mining web tools via on-the-fly generation of output graphics, such as expression bar plots, comprehensive in planta representations and heatmaps of hierarchically clustered expression data. In addition, it allows for the identification of co-expressed genes and the visualization of correlation networks of co-regulated gene groups. TomExpress provides one of the most complete free resources of publicly available tomato RNA-Seq data, and allows for the immediate interrogation of transcriptional programs that regulate vegetative and reproductive development in tomato under diverse conditions. The design of the pipeline developed in this project enables easy updating of the database with newly published RNA-Seq data, thereby allowing for continuous enrichment of the resource. © 2017 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - By profiling the transcriptomes of individual cells, single-cell RNA sequencing provides unparalleled resolution to study cellular heterogeneity. However, this comes at the cost of high technical noise, including cell-specific biases in capture efficiency and library generation. One strategy for removing these biases is to add a constant amount of spike-in RNA to each cell and to scale the observed expression values so that the coverage of spike-in transcripts is constant across cells. This approach has previously been criticized as its accuracy depends on the precise addition of spike-in RNA to each sample. Here, we perform mixture experiments using two different sets of spike-in RNA to quantify the variance in the amount of spike-in RNA added to each well in a plate-based protocol. We also obtain an upper bound on the variance due to differences in behavior between the two spike-in sets. We demonstrate that both factors are small contributors to the total technical variance and have only minor effects on downstream analyses, such as detection of highly variable genes and clustering. Our results suggest that scaling normalization using spike-in transcripts is reliable enough for routine use in single-cell RNA sequencing data analyses. © 2017 Lun et al.

AB  - We propose a novel method and software tool, Strawberry, for transcript reconstruction and quantification from RNA-Seq data under the guidance of genome alignment and independent of gene annotation. Strawberry consists of two modules: assembly and quantification. The novelty of Strawberry is that the two modules use different optimization frameworks but utilize the same data graph structure, which allows a highly efficient, expandable and accurate algorithm for dealing large data. The assembly module parses aligned reads into splicing graphs, and uses network flow algorithms to select the most likely transcripts. The quantification module uses a latent class model to assign read counts from the nodes of splicing graphs to transcripts. Strawberry simultaneously estimates the transcript abundances and corrects for sequencing bias through an EM algorithm. Based on simulations, Strawberry outperforms Cufflinks and StringTie in terms of both assembly and quantification accuracies. Under the evaluation of a real data set, the estimated transcript expression by Strawberry has the highest correlation with Nanostring probe counts, an independent experiment measure for transcript expression.

AB  - Alternative splicing (AS) is a major source of transcript and proteome diversity, but examining AS in species without well-annotated reference genomes remains difficult. Research on both human and mouse has demonstrated the advantages of using Iso-Seq™ data for isoform-level transcriptome analysis, including the study of AS and gene fusion. We applied Iso-Seq™ to investigate AS in Amborella trichopoda, a phylogenetically pivotal species that is sister to all other living angiosperms. Our data show that, compared with RNA-Seq data, the Iso-Seq™ platform provides better recovery on large transcripts, new gene locus identification and gene model correction. Reference-based AS detection with Iso-Seq™ data identifies AS within a higher fraction of multi-exonic genes than observed for published RNA-Seq analysis (45.8% vs. 37.5%). These data demonstrate that the Iso-Seq™ approach is useful for detecting AS events. Using the Iso-Seq-defined transcript collection in Amborella as a reference, we further describe a pipeline for detection of AS isoforms from PacBio Iso-Seq™ without using a reference sequence (de novo). Results using this pipeline show a 66%–76% overall success rate in identifying AS events. This de novoAS detection pipeline provides a method to accurately characterize and identify bona fide alternatively spliced transcripts in any nonmodel system that lacks a reference genome sequence. Hence, our pipeline has huge potential applications and benefits to the broader biology community. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Cell-based assays are an attractive option to measure gene expression response to exposure, but the cost of whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing has been a barrier to the use of gene expression profiling for in vitro toxicity screening. In addition, standard RNA sequencing adds variability due to variable transcript length and amplification. Targeted probe-sequencing technologies such as TempO-Seq, with transcriptomic representation that can vary from hundreds of genes to the entire transcriptome, may reduce some components of variation. Analyses of high-throughput toxicogenomics data require renewed attention to read-calling algorithms and simplified dose-response modeling for datasets with relatively few samples. Using data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes treated with chemicals at varying concentrations, we describe here and make available a pipeline for handling expression data generated by TempO-Seq to align reads, clean and normalize raw count data, identify differentially expressed genes, and calculate transcriptomic concentration-response points of departure. The methods are extensible to other forms of concentration-response gene-expression data, and we discuss the utility of the methods for assessing variation in susceptibility and the diseased cellular state. © 2017 House, Grimm, Jima, Zhou, Rusyn and Wright.

AB  - Motivation: The past decade has seen an exponential increase in biological sequencing capacity, and there has been a simultaneous effort to help organize and archive some of the vast quantities of sequencing data that are being generated. Although these developments are tremendous from the perspective of maximizing the scientific utility of available data, they come with heavy costs. The storage and transmission of such vast amounts of sequencing data is expensive.
Results: We present Quark, a semi-reference-based compression tool designed for RNA-seq data. Quark makes use of a reference sequence when encoding reads, but produces a representation that can be decoded independently, without the need for a reference. This allows Quark to achieve markedly better compression rates than existing reference-free schemes, while still relieving the burden of assuming a specific, shared reference sequence between the encoder and decoder. We demonstrate that Quark achieves state-of-the-art compression rates, and that, typically, only a small fraction of the reference sequence must be encoded along with the reads to allow reference-free decompression.
Availability and implementation: Quark is implemented in C ++11, and is available under a GPLv3 license at www.github.com/COMBINE-lab/quark.

AB  - Recent technological advances have increased the throughput of proteomics, facilitating the characterization of molecular phenotypes on the population level, thus bearing the potential to complement transcriptomic analyses. Reference protein databases are crucial for the analysis and quantification, because only peptides in the protein database can be identified. Any peptide carrying an amino acid variant cannot be identified. Because most proteomic studies, even of natural populations, do not account for polymorphisms, we analysed the influence of variant peptides on quantitative proteomic analyses. We used transcriptomic and proteomic data of two Drosophila melanogaster genotypes and identified genotype-specific variants from RNA-seq data. We introduce a simple pipeline to include these variants in a polymorphism-aware protein database and compared the results to an unmodified reference database. The polymorphism-aware database not only identifies more peptides, but the quantitative values also changed when peptide variants were included. We conclude that proteomic quantification is likely to be biased, in particular for small genes, when polymorphisms are being ignored. Polymorphism-aware databases may be therefore a key step towards improved proteomic data analyses, especially for the analysis of pooled individuals and the comparison of population samples. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The aim of the present study was to test sample reproducibility for model neural tissues formed on synthetic hydrogels. Human embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived precursor cells were cultured on synthetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels to promote differentiation and self-organization into model neural tissue constructs. Neural progenitor, vascular, and microglial precursor cells were combined on PEG hydrogels to mimic developmental timing, which produced multicomponent neural constructs with 3D neuronal and glial organization, organized vascular networks, and microglia with ramified morphologies. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis of global gene expression profiles and a comparison of coefficient of variation for expressed genes demonstrated that replicate neural constructs were highly uniform to at least day 21 for samples from independent experiments. We also demonstrate that model neural tissues formed on PEG hydrogels using a simplified neural differentiation protocol correlated more strongly to in vivo brain development than samples cultured on tissue culture polystyrene surfaces alone. These results provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that 3D cellular models that mimic aspects of human brain development can be produced from human pluripotent stem cells with high sample uniformity between experiments by using standard culture techniques, cryopreserved cell stocks, and a synthetic extracellular matrix. Impact statement: Pluripotent stem (PS) cells have been characterized by an inherent ability to self-organize into 3D “organoids” resembling stomach, intestine, liver, kidney, and brain tissues, offering a potentially powerful tool for modeling human development and disease. However, organoid formation must be quantitatively reproducible for applications such as drug and toxicity screening. Here, we report a strategy to produce uniform neural tissue constructs with reproducible global gene expression profiles for replicate samples from multiple experiments. © 2017, © 2017 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

AB  - A complete understanding of human cancer variants requires new methods to systematically and efficiently assess the functional effects of genomic mutations at a large scale. Here, we describe a set of tools to rapidly clone and stratify thousands of cancer mutations at base resolution. This protocol provides a massively parallel pipeline to achieve high stringency and throughput. The approach includes high-throughput generation of mutant clones by Gateway, confirmation of variant identity by barcoding and next-generation sequencing, and stratification of cancer variants by multiplexed interaction profiling. Compared with alternative site-directed mutagenesis methods, our protocol requires less sequencing effort and enables robust statistical calling of allele-specific effects. To ensure the precision of variant interaction profiling, we further describe two complementary methods - a high-throughput enhanced yeast two-hybrid (HT-eY2H) assay and a mammalian-cell-based Gaussia princeps luciferase protein-fragment complementation assay (GPCA). These independent assays with standard controls validate mutational interaction profiles with high quality. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for classifying candidate cancer alleles emerging from whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing projects as 'drivers' or 'passengers'. For 1/4100 genomic mutations, the protocol - including target primer design, variant library construction, and sequence verification - can be completed within as little as 2-3 weeks, and cancer variant stratification can be completed within 2 weeks. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The objective of this article is to introduce valid and robust methods for the analysis of rare variants for family-based exome chips, whole-exome sequencing or whole-genome sequencing data. Family-based designs provide unique opportunities to detect genetic variants that complement studies of unrelated individuals. Currently, limited methods and software tools have been developed to assist family-based association studies with rare variants, especially for analyzing binary traits. In this article, we address this gap by extending existing burden and kernel-based gene set association tests for population data to related samples, with a particular emphasis on binary phenotypes. The proposed approach blends the strengths of kernel machine methods and generalized estimating equations. Importantly, the efficient generalized kernel score test can be applied as a mega-analysis framework to combine studies with different designs. We illustrate the application of the proposed method using data from an exome sequencing study of autism. Methods discussed in this article are implemented in an R package 'gskat', which is available on CRAN and GitHub. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the development of high-throughput genomic analysis, sequencing a mouse primary cancer model provides a new opportunity to understand fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis and progression. Here, we characterized the genomic variations in a hepatitis-related primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model. A total of 12 tumor sections and four adjacent non-tumor tissues from four mice were used for whole exome and/or whole genome sequencing and validation of genotyping. The functions of the mutated genes in tumorigenesis were studied by analyzing their mutation frequency and expression in clinical HCC samples. A total of 46 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were detected within coding regions. All SNVs were only validated in the sequencing samples, except the Hras mutation, which was shared by three tumors in the M1 mouse. However, the mutated allele frequency varied from high (0.4) to low (0.1), and low frequency (0.1–0.2) mutations existed in almost every tumor. Together with a diploid karyotype and an equal distribution pattern of these SNVs within the tumor, these results suggest the existence of subclones within tumors. A total of 26 mutated genes were mapped to 17 terms describing different molecular and cellular functions. All 41 human homologs of the mutated genes were mutated in the clinical samples, and some mutations were associated with clinical outcomes, suggesting a high probability of cancer driver genes in the spontaneous tumors of the mouse model. Genomic sequencing shows that a few mutations can drive the independent origin of primary liver tumors and reveals high heterogeneity among tumors in the early stage of hepatitis-related primary hepatocellular carcinoma. © 2017 Yang et al.

AB  - Background: Homology search is still a significant step in functional analysis for genomic data. Profile Hidden Markov Model-based homology search has been widely used in protein domain analysis in many different species. In particular, with the fast accumulation of transcriptomic data of non-model species and metagenomic data, profile homology search is widely adopted in integrated pipelines for functional analysis. While the state-of-the-art tool HMMER has achieved high sensitivity and accuracy in domain annotation, the sensitivity of HMMER on short reads declines rapidly. The low sensitivity on short read homology search can lead to inaccurate domain composition and abundance computation. Our experimental results showed that half of the reads were missed by HMMER for a RNA-Seq dataset. Thus, there is a need for better methods to improve the homology search performance for short reads. Results: We introduce a profile homology search tool named Short-Pair that is designed for short paired-end reads. By using an approximate Bayesian approach employing distribution of fragment lengths and alignment scores, Short-Pair can retrieve the missing end and determine true domains. In particular, Short-Pair increases the accuracy in aligning short reads that are part of remote homologs. We applied Short-Pair to a RNA-Seq dataset and a metagenomic dataset and quantified its sensitivity and accuracy on homology search. The experimental results show that Short-Pair can achieve better overall performance than the state-of-the-art methodology of profile homology search. Conclusions: Short-Pair is best used for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data that lack reference genomes. It provides a complementary paired-end read homology search tool to HMMER.

AB  - Background: With the development of rapid and inexpensive DNA sequencing, the genome sequences of more than 100 fungal species have been made available. This dataset provides an excellent resource for comparative genomics analyses, which can be used to discover genetic elements, including noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Bioinformatics tools similar to those used to uncover novel ncRNAs in bacteria, likewise, should be useful for searching fungal genomic sequences, and the relative ease of genetic experiments with some model fungal species could facilitate experimental validation studies. Results: We have adapted a bioinformatics pipeline for discovering bacterial ncRNAs to systematically analyze many fungal genomes. This comparative genomics pipeline integrates information on conserved RNA sequence and structural features with alternative splicing information to reveal fungal RNA motifs that are candidate regulatory domains, or that might have other possible functions. A total of 15 prominent classes of structured ncRNA candidates were identified, including variant HDV self-cleaving ribozyme representatives, atypical snoRNA candidates, and possible structured antisense RNA motifs. Candidate regulatory motifs were also found associated with genes for ribosomal proteins, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SDC), amidase, and HexA protein involved in Woronin body formation. We experimentally confirm that the variant HDV ribozymes undergo rapid self-cleavage, and we demonstrate that the SDC RNA motif reduces the expression of SAM decarboxylase by translational repression. Furthermore, we provide evidence that several other motifs discovered in this study are likely to be functional ncRNA elements. Conclusions: Systematic screening of fungal genomes using a computational discovery pipeline has revealed the existence of a variety of novel structured ncRNAs. Genome contexts and similarities to known ncRNA motifs provide strong evidence for the biological and biochemical functions of some newly found ncRNA motifs. Although initial examinations of several motifs provide evidence for their likely functions, other motifs will require more in-depth analysis to reveal their functions. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Since experimental elucidation of gene function is often laborious, various in silico methods have been developed to predict gene function of uncharacterized genes. Since functionally related genes are often expressed in the same tissues, conditions and developmental stages (co-expressed), functional annotation of characterized genes can be transferred to co-expressed genes lacking annotation. With genome-wide expression data available, the construction of co-expression networks, where genes are nodes and edges connect significantly co-expressed genes, provides unprecedented opportunities to predict gene function. However, the construction of such networks requires large volumes of high-quality data, multiple processing steps and a considerable amount of computation power. While efficient tools exist to process RNA-Seq data, pipelines which combine them to construct co-expression networks efficiently are currently lacking. Results: LSTrAP (Large-Scale Transcriptome Analysis Pipeline), presented here, combines all essential tools to construct co-expression networks based on RNA-Seq data into a single, efficient workflow. By supporting parallel computing on computer cluster infrastructure, processing hundreds of samples becomes feasible as shown here for Arabidopsis thaliana and Sorghum bicolor, which comprised 876 and 215 samples respectively. The former was used here to show how the quality control, included in LSTrAP, can detect spurious or low-quality samples. The latter was used to show how co-expression networks are able to group known photosynthesis genes and imply a role in this process of several, currently uncharacterized, genes. Conclusions: LSTrAP combines the most popular and performant methods to construct co-expression networks from RNA-Seq data into a single workflow. This allows large amounts of expression data, required to construct co-expression networks, to be processed efficiently and consistently across hundreds of samples.

AB  - Background: Although ultrahigh-throughput RNA-Sequencing has become the dominant technology for genome-wide transcriptional profiling, the vast majority of RNA-Seq studies typically profile only tens of samples, and most analytical pipelines are optimized for these smaller studies. However, projects are generating ever-larger data sets comprising RNA-Seq data from hundreds or thousands of samples, often collected at multiple centers and from diverse tissues. These complex data sets present significant analytical challenges due to batch and tissue effects, but provide the opportunity to revisit the assumptions and methods that we use to preprocess, normalize, and filter RNA-Seq data - critical first steps for any subsequent analysis. Results: We find that analysis of large RNA-Seq data sets requires both careful quality control and the need to account for sparsity due to the heterogeneity intrinsic in multi-group studies. We developed Yet Another RNA Normalization software pipeline (YARN), that includes quality control and preprocessing, gene filtering, and normalization steps designed to facilitate downstream analysis of large, heterogeneous RNA-Seq data sets and we demonstrate its use with data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Conclusions: An R package instantiating YARN is available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/yarn. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: It is generally thought that most canonical or non-canonical splicing events involving U2- and U12 spliceosomes occur within nuclear pre-mRNAs. However, the question of whether at least some U12-type splicing occurs in the cytoplasm is still unclear. In recent years next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the field. The "Read-Split-Walk" (RSW) and "Read-Split-Run" (RSR) methods were developed to identify genome-wide non-canonical spliced regions including special events occurring in cytoplasm. As the significant amount of genome/transcriptome data such as, Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, have been generated, we have advanced a newer more memory-efficient version of the algorithm, "Read-Split-Fly" (RSF), which can detect non-canonical spliced regions with higher sensitivity and improved speed. The RSF algorithm also outputs the spliced sequences for further downstream biological function analysis. Results: We used open access ENCODE project RNA-Seq data to search spliced intron sequences against the U12-type spliced intron sequence database to examine whether some events could occur as potential signatures of U12-type splicing. The check was performed by searching spliced sequences against 5'ss and 3'ss sequences from the well-known orthologous U12-type spliceosomal intron database U12DB. Preliminary results of searching 70 ENCODE samples indicated that the presence of 5'ss with U12-type signature is more frequent than U2-type and prevalent in non-canonical junctions reported by RSF. The selected spliced sequences have also been further studied using miRBase to elucidate their functionality. Preliminary results from 70 samples of ENCODE datasets show that several miRNAs are prevalent in studied ENCODE samples. Two of these are associated with many diseases as suggested in the literature. Specifically, hsa-miR-1273 and hsa-miR-548 are associated with many diseases and cancers. Conclusions: Our RSF pipeline is able to detect many possible junctions (especially those with a high RPKM) with very high overall accuracy and relative high accuracy for novel junctions. We have incorporated useful parameter features into the pipeline such as, handling variable-length read data, and searching spliced sequences for splicing signatures and miRNA events. We suggest RSF, a tool for identifying novel splicing events, is applicable to study a range of diseases across biological systems under different experimental conditions. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Copy number variations (CNVs) are the main genetic structural variations in cancer genome. Detecting CNVs in genetic exome region is efficient and cost-effective in identifying cancer associated genes. Many tools had been developed accordingly and yet these tools lack of reliability because of high false negative rate, which is intrinsically caused by genome exonic bias. Results: To provide an alternative option, here, we report Anaconda, a comprehensive pipeline that allows flexible integration of multiple CNV-calling methods and systematic annotation of CNVs in analyzing WES data. Just by one command, Anaconda can generate CNV detection result by up to four CNV detecting tools. Associated with comprehensive annotation analysis of genes involved in shared CNV regions, Anaconda is able to deliver a more reliable and useful report in assistance with CNV-associate cancer researches. Conclusion: Anaconda package and manual can be freely accessed at http://mcg.ustc.edu.cn/bsc/ANACONDA/. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - High throughput sequencing (HTS) is useful for many purposes as exemplified by the other topics included in this special issue. The purpose of this paper is to look into the unique challenges of using this technology in non-model organisms where resources such as genomes, functional genome annotations or genome complexity provide obstacles not met in model organisms. To describe these challenges, we narrow our scope to RNA sequencing used to study differential gene expression in response to pathogen challenge. As a demonstration species we chose Atlantic salmon, which has a sequenced genome with poor annotation and an added complexity due to many duplicated genes. We find that our RNA-seq analysis pipeline deciphers between duplicates despite high sequence identity. However, annotation issues provide problems in linking differentially expressed genes to pathways. Also, comparing results between approaches and species are complicated due to lack of standardized annotation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Leptosphaeria maculans, the causal agent of stem canker disease, colonizes oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in two stages: a short and early colonization stage corresponding to cotyledon or leaf colonization, and a late colonization stage during which the fungus colonizes systemically and symptomlessly the plant during several months before stem canker appears. To date, the determinants of the late colonization stage are poorly understood; L. maculans may either successfully escape plant defences, leading to stem canker development, or the plant may develop an ‘adult-stage’ resistance reducing canker incidence. To obtain an insight into these determinants, we performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) pilot project comparing fungal gene expression in infected cotyledons and in symptomless or necrotic stems. Despite the low fraction of fungal material in infected stems, sufficient fungal transcripts were detected and a large number of fungal genes were expressed, thus validating the feasibility of the approach. Our analysis showed that all avirulence genes previously identified are under-expressed during stem colonization compared with cotyledon colonization. A validation RNA-seq experiment was then performed to investigate the expression of candidate effector genes during systemic colonization. Three hundred and seven ‘late’ effector candidates, under-expressed in the early colonization stage and over-expressed in the infected stems, were identified. Finally, our analysis revealed a link between the regulation of expression of effectors and their genomic location: the ‘late’ effector candidates, putatively involved in systemic colonization, are located in gene-rich genomic regions, whereas the ‘early’ effector genes, over-expressed in the early colonization stage, are located in gene-poor regions of the genome. © 2016 BSPP AND JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD

AB  - Immortalized cell lines are widely used to study the effectiveness and toxicity of anti cancer drugs as well as to assess the phenotypic characteristics of cancer cells, such as proliferation and migration ability. Unfortunately, cell lines often show extremely different properties than tumor tissues. Also the primary cells, that are deprived of the in vivo environment, might adapt to artificial conditions, and differ from the tissue they should represent. Despite these considerations, cell lines are still one of the most used cancer models due to their availability and capability to expand without limitation, but the clinical relevance of their use is still a big issue in cancer research. Many studies tried to overcome this task, comparing cell lines and tumor samples through the definition of the genomic and transcriptomic differences. To this aim, most of them used nucleotide variation or gene expression data. Here we introduce a different strategy based on alternative splicing detection and integration of DNA and RNA sequencing data, to explore the differences between immortalized and tissue-derived cells at isoforms level. Furthermore, in order to better investigate the heterogeneity of both cell populations, we took advantage of a public available dataset obtained with a new simultaneous omics single cell sequencing methodology. The proposed pipeline allowed us to identify, through a computational and prediction approach, putative mutated and alternative spliced transcripts responsible for the dissimilarity between immortalized and primary hepato carcinoma cells. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Motivation Sequencing-based methods to examine fundamental features of the genome, such as gene expression and chromatin structure, rely on inferences from the abundance and distribution of reads derived from Illumina sequencing. Drawing sound inferences from such experiments relies on appropriate mathematical methods to model the distribution of reads along the genome, which has been challenging due to the scale and nature of these data. Results We propose a new framework (SRSFseq) based on square root slope functions shape analysis to analyse Illumina sequencing data. In the new approach the basic unit of information is the density of mapped reads over region of interest located on the known reference genome. The densities are interpreted as shapes and a new shape analysis model is proposed. An equivalent of a Fisher test is used to quantify the significance of shape differences in read distribution patterns between groups of density functions in different experimental conditions. We evaluated the performance of this new framework to analyze RNA-seq data at the exon level, which enabled the detection of variation in read distributions and abundances between experimental conditions not detected by other methods. Thus, the method is a suitable supplement to the state-of-the-art count based techniques. The variety of density representations and flexibility of mathematical design allow the model to be easily adapted to other data types or problems in which the distribution of reads is to be tested. The functional interpretation and SRSF phase-amplitude separation technique give an efficient noise reduction procedure improving the sensitivity and specificity of the method. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Interpretation of variants of unknown significance (VUS) is a major challenge for laboratories performing molecular diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), especially considering that many genes are now known to be involved in this syndrome. One important way these VUS can have a functional impact is through their effects on RNA splicing. Here we present a custom RNA-Seq assay plus bioinformatics and biostatistics pipeline to analyse specifically alternative and abnormal splicing junctions in 11 targeted HBOC genes. Our pipeline identified 14 new alternative splices in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in addition to detecting the majority of known alternative spliced transcripts therein. We provide here the first global splicing pattern analysis for the other nine genes, which will enable a comprehensive interpretation of splicing defects caused by VUS in HBOC. Previously known splicing alterations were consistently detected, occasionally with a more complex splicing pattern than expected. We also found that splicing in the 11 genes is similar in blood and breast tissue, supporting the utility and simplicity of blood splicing assays. Our pipeline is ready to be integrated into standard molecular diagnosis for HBOC, but it could equally be adapted for an integrative analysis of any multigene disorder. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Proteogenomics, i.e. comprehensive integration of genomics and proteomics data, is a powerful approach identifying novel protein biomarkers. This is especially the case for proteins that differ structurally between disease and control conditions. As tumor development is associated with aberrant splicing, we focus on this rich source of cancer specific biomarkers. To this end, we developed a proteogenomic pipeline, Splicify, which can detect differentially expressed protein isoforms. Splicify is based on integrating RNA massive parallel sequencing data and tandem mass spectrometry proteomics data to identify protein isoforms resulting from differential splicing between two conditions. Proof of concept was obtained by applying Splicify to RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry data obtained from colorectal cancer cell line SW480, before and after siRNA-mediated downmodulation of the splicing factors SF3B1 and SRSF1. These analyses revealed 2172 and 149 differentially expressed isoforms, respectively, with peptide confirmation upon knock-down of SF3B1 and SRSF1 compared with their controls. Splice variants identified included RAC1, OSBPL3, MKI67, and SYK. One additional sample was analyzed by PacBio Iso-Seq full-length transcript sequencing after SF3B1 downmodulation. This analysis verified the alternative splicing identified by Splicify and in addition identified novel splicing events that were not represented in the human reference genome annotation. Therefore, Splicify offers a validated proteogenomic data analysis pipeline for identification of disease specific protein biomarkers resulting from mRNA alternative splicing. Splicify is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/NKI-TGO/ SPLICIFY) and suitable to address basic research questions using pre-clinical model systems as well as translational research questions using patient-derived samples, e.g. allowing to identify clinically relevant biomarkers. © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - MicroRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) are short non-coding regulatory sRNAs which play an important role in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by targeting mRNAs for degradation or inhibiting protein translation. To explore the presence of milRNAs in Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (Fon) and analyze their expression at different propagules, two categories of sRNAs were identified from Fon hyphae and microconidia using illumina sequencing. A total of 650,960 and 561,114 unique sRNAs were obtained from the hyphae and microconidia samples. With a previously constructed pipeline to search for microRNAs, 74 and 56 milRNA candidates were identified in hyphae and microconidia, respectively, based on the short hairpin structure analysis. Global expression analysis showed an extensively differential expression of sRNAs between the two propagules. Altogether, 78 significantly differently expressed milRNAs were identified in two libraries. Target prediction revealed two interesting genes involved in trichothecene production, necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1 (NEP1) biosynthesis and in silico analysis indicated that they were down-regulated by Fon-miR7696a-3p and Fon-miR6108a. The expression levels of these two milRNAs were further validated by qRT-PCR and the results were consistent. The negative correlation of the expression levels between these two milRNAs and their potential target genes imply that they play a role in trichothecene and NEP1 biosynthesis. And this negative regulation for toxin-related gene expression is more specific in microconidia. The present study provides the first large-scale characterization of milRNAs in Fon and the comparison between hyphae and microconidia propagules gives an insight into how milRNAs are involve in toxin biosynthesis. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has turned from a new and experimental technology into a standard procedure for cancer genome studies and clinical investigation. While a multitude of software packages for cancer genome data analysis have been made available, these need to be combined into efficient analytical workflows that cover multiple aspects relevant to a clinical environment and that deliver handy results within a reasonable time frame. Here, we introduce QuickNGS Cancer as a new suite of bioinformatics pipelines that is focused on cancer genomics and significantly reduces the analytical hurdles that still limit a broader applicability of NGS technology, particularly to clinically driven research. QuickNGS Cancer allows a highly efficient analysis of a broad variety of NGS data types, specifically considering cancer-specific issues, such as biases introduced by tumor impurity and aneuploidy or the assessment of genomic variations regarding their biomedical relevance. It delivers highly reproducible analysis results ready for interpretation within only a few days after sequencing, as shown by a reanalysis of 140 tumor/normal pairs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in which QuickNGS Cancer detected a significant number of mutations in key cancer genes missed by a well-established mutation calling pipeline. Finally, QuickNGS Cancer obtained several unexpected mutations in leukemias that could be confirmed by Sanger sequencing. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: The evolution of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has led to increased focus on RNA-Seq. Many bioinformatic tools have been developed for RNA-Seq analysis, each with unique performance characteristics and configuration parameters. Users face an increasingly complex task in understanding which bioinformatic tools are best for their specific needs and how they should be configured. In order to provide some answers to these questions, we investigate the performance of leading bioinformatic tools designed for RNA-Seq analysis and propose a methodology for systematic evaluation and comparison of performance to help users make well informed choices. Results: To evaluate RNA-Seq pipelines, we developed a suite of two benchmarking tools. SimCT generates simulated datasets that get as close as possible to specific real biological conditions accompanied by the list of genomic incidents and mutations that have been inserted. BenchCT then compares the output of any bioinformatics pipeline that has been run against a SimCT dataset with the simulated genomic and transcriptional variations it contains to give an accurate performance evaluation in addressing specific biological question. We used these tools to simulate a real-world genomic medicine question s involving the comparison of healthy and cancerous cells. Results revealed that performance in addressing a particular biological context varied significantly depending on the choice of tools and settings used. We also found that by combining the output of certain pipelines, substantial performance improvements could be achieved. Conclusion: Our research emphasizes the importance of selecting and configuring bioinformatic tools for the specific biological question being investigated to obtain optimal results. Pipeline designers, developers and users should include benchmarking in the context of their biological question as part of their design and quality control process. Our SimBA suite of benchmarking tools provides a reliable basis for comparing the performance of RNA-Seq bioinformatics pipelines in addressing a specific biological question. We would like to see the creation of a reference corpus of data-sets that would allow accurate comparison between benchmarks performed by different groups and the publication of more benchmarks based on this public corpus. SimBA software and data-set are available at http://cractools.gforge.inria.fr/softwares/simba/. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Recently, chimeric transcripts have been found to be associated with the pathogenesis and poor prognosis of malignant tumors. Through our preliminary experiment, a novel chimeric transcript called chimeric transcript RRM2-c2orf48 was detected in C666-1, a classical cell line of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Therefore, the objective of this study was to demonstrate the existence and expression of novel chimeric transcript RRM2-c2orf48 and to explore the main functions and mechanisms of RRM2-c2orf48 in NPC. In this study, the expression of RRM2-c2orf48 was evaluated in NPC cells and specimens. Effects of RRM2-c2orf48 on migration and invasive capacities were detected in vivo and vitro. Moreover, ways in which RRM2-c2orf48 increases the invasive capacities of NPC were explored. As a result, the presence of novel chimeric transcript RRM2-c2orf48 was confirmed in C666-1 by RT-PCR and sequencing, and it was a read-through between RRM2 and c2orf48 through the transcription of interchromosome. Higher expressions of novel RRM2-c2orf48 were detected in NPC cell lines and NPC tissue specimens relative to the controls and its expression was be statistically relevant to TNM staging. High level of RRM2-c2orf48 could increase the migration and invasive capacities of NPC cells, potentially as a result of NPC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition. RRM2-c2orf48 could also enhance resistance of chemotherapy. In vivo, RRM2-c2orf48 could enhance lung and lymph node metastasis in nude mice. These results demonstrate that high levels of RRM2-c2orf48 expression may be a useful predictor of NPC patients of metastatic potency, presenting potential implications for NPC diagnosis and therapy.

AB  - We developed an RNA-sequencing-based pipeline to discover differentially expressed cell-surface molecules in neuroblastoma that meet criteria for optimal immunotherapeutic target safety and efficacy. Here, we show that GPC2 is a strong candidate immunotherapeutic target in this childhood cancer. We demonstrate high GPC2 expression in neuroblastoma due to MYCN transcriptional activation and/or somatic gain of the GPC2 locus. We confirm GPC2 to be highly expressed on most neuroblastomas, but not detectable at appreciable levels in normal childhood tissues. In addition, we demonstrate that GPC2 is required for neuroblastoma proliferation. Finally, we develop a GPC2-directed antibody-drug conjugate that is potently cytotoxic to GPC2-expressing neuroblastoma cells. Collectively, these findings validate GPC2 as a non-mutated neuroblastoma oncoprotein and candidate immunotherapeutic target. Bosse et al. show that GPC2 is expressed at high levels on most neuroblastomas (NB) but not at appreciable levels in normal childhood tissues and that GPC2 is critical for NB maintenance. They develop a GPC2-directed antibody-drug conjugate that is cytotoxic to GPC2-expressing NB cells in vitro and in vivo. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Measuring how gene expression changes in the course of an experiment assesses how an organism responds on a molecular level. Sequencing of RNA molecules, and their subsequent quantification, aims to assess global gene expression changes on the RNA level (transcriptome). While advances in high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies allow for inexpensive data generation, accurate post-processing and normalization across samples is required to eliminate any systematic noise introduced by the biochemical and/or technical processes. Existing methods thus either normalize on selected known reference genes that are invariant in expression across the experiment, assume that the majority of genes are invariant, or that the effects of up- and down-regulated genes cancel each other out during the normalization. Results: Here, we present a novel method, moose 2, which predicts invariant genes in silico through a dynamic programming (DP) scheme and applies a quadratic normalization based on this subset. The method allows for specifying a set of known or experimentally validated invariant genes, which guides the DP. We experimentally verified the predictions of this method in the bacterium Escherichia coli, and show how moose 2 is able to (i) estimate the expression value distances between RNA-seq samples, (ii) reduce the variation of expression values across all samples, and (iii) to subsequently reveal new functional groups of genes during the late stages of DNA damage. We further applied the method to three eukaryotic data sets, on which its performance compares favourably to other methods. The software is implemented in C++ and is publicly available from http://grabherr.github.io/moose2/. Conclusions: The proposed RNA-seq normalization method, moose 2, is a valuable alternative to existing methods, with two major advantages: (i) in silico prediction of invariant genes provides a list of potential reference genes for downstream analyses, and (ii) non-linear artefacts in RNA-seq data are handled adequately to minimize variations between replicates. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a high-throughput technology that provides unique insights into the transcriptome. It has a wide variety of applications in quantifying genes/isoforms and in detecting non-coding RNA, alternative splicing, and splice junctions. It is extremely important to comprehend the entire transcriptome for a thorough understanding of the cellular system. Several RNA-seq analysis pipelines have been proposed to date. However, no single analysis pipeline can capture dynamics of the entire transcriptome. Here, we compile and present a robust and commonly used analytical pipeline covering the entire spectrum of transcriptome analysis, including quality checks, alignment of reads, differential gene/transcript expression analysis, discovery of cryptic splicing events, and visualization. Challenges, critical parameters, and possible downstream functional analysis pipelines associated with each step are highlighted and discussed. This unit provides a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art RNA-seq analysis pipeline and a greater understanding of the transcriptome. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - The stepwise and sequential expression of viral genes underlies progression of the infectious life cycle. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is both a tractable model for elucidating principles of transcription as well as a global health threat. We describe an experimental protocol and bioinformatics pipeline for functional identification of EBV true late genes, the last step of transcription prior to virion packaging and egress. All data have been uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession code GSE96689. The key improvement over previous approaches is leveraging the sensitivity of RNA-seq to detect gene expression changes during spontaneous reactivation. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Over the last decade, a large number of nucleotide sequences have been generated by next-generation sequencing technologies and deposited to public databases. However, most of these datasets do not specify the sex of individuals sampled because researchers typically ignore or hide this information. Male and female genomes in many species have distinctive sex chromosomes, XX/XY and ZW/ZZ, and expression levels of many sex-related genes differ between the sexes. Herein, we describe how to develop sex marker sequences from syntenic regions of sex chromosomes and use them to quickly identify the sex of individuals being analyzed. Array-based technologies routinely use either known sex markers or the B-allele frequency of X or Z chromosomes to deduce the sex of an individual. The same strategy has been used with whole-exome/genome sequence data; however, all reads must be aligned onto a reference genome to determine the B-allele frequency of the X or Z chromosomes. SEXCMD is a pipeline that can extract sex marker sequences from reference sex chromosomes and rapidly identify the sex of individuals from whole-exome/ genome and RNA sequencing after training with a known dataset through a simple machine learning approach. The pipeline counts total numbers of hits from sex-specific marker sequences and identifies the sex of the individuals sampled based on the fact that XX/ZZ samples do not have Y or W chromosome hits. We have successfully validated our pipeline with mammalian (Homo sapiens; XY) and avian (Gallus gallus; ZW) genomes. Typical calculation time when applying SEXCMD to human whole-exome or RNA sequencing datasets is a few minutes, and analyzing human whole-genome datasets takes about 10 minutes. Another important application of SEXCMD is as a quality control measure to avoid mixing samples before bioinformatics analysis.

AB  - The development of haploid mammalian cell lines, coupled to next-generation sequencing, has recently facilitated forward genetic screenings in mammals. For mutagenesis, retrovirus- or transposon-based gene traps are frequently used. Current methods to map gene-trap insertions are based on inverse or splinkerette PCR, which despite their efficacy are prone to artifacts and do not provide information on expression of the targeted gene. Here, we describe a new RNA sequencing-based method (TrapSeq) to map gene-trap insertions. By recognizing chimeric mRNAs containing gene-trap sequences spliced to an exon, our method identifies insertions that lead to productive trapping. When applied to individual mutant clones, our method provides a fast and cost-effective way that not only identifies the insertion site but also reveals its impact on the expression of the trapped gene. As proof of principle, we conducted two independent screenings for resistance against 6-thioguanine and an ATR inhibitor, which identified mutations known to provide resistance to these reagents and revealed ECT2 as a novel determinant for the sensitivity to ATR inhibition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Two populations of alveolar macrophages (AMs) coexist in the inflamed lung: resident AMs that arise during embryogenesis, and recruited AMsthat originate postnatally from circulating monocytes. The objective of this study was to determine whether origin or environment dictates the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional programming of these two ontologically distinct populations over the time course of acute inflammation. RNA sequencing demonstrated marked transcriptional differences between resident and recruited AMs affecting three main areas: proliferation, inflammatory signaling, and metabolism. Functional assays and metabolomic studies confirmed these differences and demonstrated that resident AMs proliferate locally and are governed by increased tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid metabolism. Conversely, recruited AMs produce inflammatory cytokines in association with increased glycolytic and arginine metabolism. Collectively, the data show that even though they coexist in the same environment, inflammatory macrophage subsets have distinct immunometabolic programs and perform specialized functions during inflammation that are associated with their cellular origin.

AB  - Rationale: Currently, there are no blood-based biomarkers with clinical utility for acute ischemic stroke (IS). MicroRNAs show promise as disease markers because of their cell type–specific expression patterns and stability in peripheral blood. Objective: To identify circulating microRNAs associated with acute IS, determine their temporal course up to 90 days post-stroke, and explore their utility as an early diagnostic marker. Methods and Results: We used RNA sequencing to study expression changes of circulating microRNAs in a discovery sample of 20 patients with IS and 20 matched healthy control subjects. We further applied quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in independent samples for validation (40 patients with IS and 40 matched controls), replication (200 patients with IS, 100 healthy control subjects), and in 72 patients with transient ischemic attacks. Sampling of patient plasma was done immediately upon hospital arrival. We identified, validated, and replicated 3 differentially expressed microRNAs, which were upregulated in patients with IS compared with both healthy control subjects (miR-125a-5p [1.8-fold; P=1.5×10−6], miR-125b-5p [2.5-fold; P=5.6×10−6], and miR-143-3p [4.8-fold; P=7.8×10−9]) and patients with transient ischemic attack (miR-125a-5p: P=0.003; miR-125b-5p: P=0.003; miR-143-3p: P=0.005). Longitudinal analysis of expression levels up to 90 days after stroke revealed a normalization to control levels for miR-125b-5p and miR-143-3p starting at day 2 while miR-125a-5p remained elevated. Levels of all 3 microRNAs depended on platelet numbers in a platelet spike-in experiment but were unaffected by chemical hypoxia in Neuro2a cells and in experimental stroke models. In a random forest classification, miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-143-3p differentiated between healthy control subjects and patients with IS with an area under the curve of 0.90 (sensitivity: 85.6%; specificity: 76.3%), which was superior to multimodal cranial computed tomography obtained for routine diagnostics (sensitivity: 72.5%) and previously reported biomarkers of acute IS (neuron-specific enolase: area under the curve=0.69; interleukin 6: area under the curve=0.82). Conclusions: A set of circulating microRNAs (miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-143-3p) associates with acute IS and might have clinical utility as an early diagnostic marker. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - Treating insulin resistance with pioglitazone normalizes renal function and improves small nerve fibre function and architecture; however, it does not affect large myelinated nerve fibre function in mouse models of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), indicating that pioglitazone affects the body in a tissue-specific manner. To identify distinct molecular pathways regulating diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and nephropathy (DN), as well those affected by pioglitazone, we assessed DPN and DN gene transcript expression in control and diabetic mice with or without pioglitazone treatment. Differential expression analysis and self-organizing maps were then used in parallel to analyse transcriptome data. Differential expression analysis showed that gene expression promoting cell death and the inflammatory response was reversed in the kidney glomeruli but unchanged or exacerbated in sciatic nerve by pioglitazone. Self-organizing map analysis revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction was normalized in kidney and nerve by treatment; however, conserved pathways were opposite in their directionality of regulation. Collectively, our data suggest inflammation may drive large fibre dysfunction, while mitochondrial dysfunction may drive small fibre dysfunction in T2DM. Moreover, targeting both of these pathways is likely to improve DN. This study supports growing evidence that systemic metabolic changes in T2DM are associated with distinct tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming in kidney and nerve and that these changes play a critical role in DN and small fibre DPN pathogenesis. These data also highlight the potential dangers of a ‘one size fits all’ approach to T2DM therapeutics, as the same drug may simultaneously alleviate one complication while exacerbating another. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Thanks to specific adaptations developed over millions of years, the efficiency of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition of higher termite symbiotic system exceeds that of many other lignocellulose utilizing environments. Especially, the examination of its symbiotic microbes should reveal interesting carbohydrate-active enzymes, which are of primary interest for the industry. Previous metatranscriptomic reports (high-throughput mRNA sequencing) highlight the high representation and overexpression of cellulose and hemicelluloses degrading genes in the termite hindgut digestomes, indicating the potential of this technology in search for new enzymes. Nevertheless, several factors associated with the material sampling and library preparation steps make the metatranscriptomic studies of termite gut prokaryotic symbionts challenging. Methods: In this study, we first examined the influence of the sampling strategy, including the whole termite gut and luminal fluid, on the diversity and the metatranscriptomic profiles of the higher termite gut symbiotic bacteria. Secondly, we evaluated different commercially available kits combined in two library preparative pipelines for the best bacterial mRNA enrichment strategy. Results: We showed that the sampling strategy did not significantly impact the generated results, both in terms of the representation of the microbes and their transcriptomic profiles. Nevertheless collecting luminal fluid reduces the co-amplification of unwanted RNA species of host origin. Furthermore, for the four studied higher termite species, the library preparative pipeline employing Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit "Epidemiology" in combination with Poly(A) Purist MAG kit resulted in a more efficient rRNA and poly-A-mRNAdepletion (up to 98.44% rRNA removed) than the pipeline utilizing MICROBExpress and MICROBEnrich kits. High correlation of both Ribo-Zero and MICROBExpresse depleted gene expression profiles with total non-depleted RNA-seq data has been shown for all studied samples, indicating no systematic skewing of the studied pipelines. Conclusions: We have extensively evaluated the impact of the sampling strategy and library preparation steps on the metatranscriptomic profiles of the higher termite gut symbiotic bacteria. The presented methodological approach has great potential to enhance metatranscriptomic studies of the higher termite intestinal flora and to unravel novel carbohydrate-active enzymes. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction For the relative quantification of isoform expression, RT-qPCR has been the gold standard for over a decade. More recently, digital PCR is becoming widely implemented, as it is promised to be more accurate, sensitive and less affected by inhibitors, without the need for standard curves. In this study we evaluated RT-qPCR versus RT-droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for the relative quantification of isoforms in controls and carriers of the splice site mutation BRCA1 c.212+3A>G, associated with increased expression of several isoforms. Materials and methods RNA was extracted from EBV cell lines of controls and heterozygous BRCA1 c.212+3A>G carriers. Transcript-specific plasmids were available to determine the efficiency, precision, reproducibility and accuracy of each method. Results Both ddPCR and RT-qPCR were able to accurately quantify all targets and showed the same LOB, LOD and LOQ; also precision and reproducibility were similar. Both techniques have the same dynamic range and linearity at biologically relevant template concentrations. However, a significantly higher cost and workload was required for ddPCR experiments. Conclusions Our study recognizes the potential and validity of digital PCR but shows the value of a highly optimized qPCR for the relative quantification of isoforms. Cost efficiency and simplicity turned out to be better for RT-qPCR. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium has published whole-genome functional annotation maps in 127 human cell types by integrating data from studies of multiple epigenetic marks. These maps have been widely used for studying gene regulation in cell type-specific contexts and predicting the functional impact of DNA mutations on disease. Here, we present a new map of functional elements produced by applying amethod called IDEAS on the same data. The method has several unique advantages and outperforms existing methods, including that used by the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium. Using five categories of independent experimental datasets, we compared the IDEAS and Roadmap Epigenomics maps. While the overall concordance between the two maps is high, the maps differ substantially in the prediction details and in their consistency of annotation of a given genomic position across cell types. The annotation from IDEAS is uniformly more accurate than the Roadmap Epigenomics annotation and the improvement is substantial based on several criteria. We further introduce a pipeline that improves the reproducibility of functional annotation maps. Thus, we provide a high-quality map of candidate functional regions across 127 human cell types and compare the quality of different annotation methods in order to facilitate biomedical research in epigenomics. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Purpose: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The molecular events preceding the onset of disease are poorly understood, and no effective tools exist to identify smokers with premalignant lesions (PMLs) that will progress to invasive cancer. Prior work identified molecular alterations in the smoke-exposed airway field of injury associated with lung cancer. Here, we focus on an earlier stage in the disease process leveraging the airway field of injury to study PMLs and its utility in lung cancer chemoprevention. Experimental Design: Bronchial epithelial cells from normal appearing bronchial mucosa were profiled by mRNA-Seq from subjects with (n = 50) and without (n = 25) PMLs. Using surrogate variable and gene set enrichment analysis, we identified genes, pathways, and lung cancer-related gene sets differentially expressed between subjects with and without PMLs. A computational pipeline was developed to build and test a chemoprevention-relevant biomarker. Results: We identified 280 genes in the airway field associated with the presence of PMLs. Among the upregulated genes, oxidative phosphorylation was strongly enriched, and IHC and bioenergetics studies confirmed pathway findings in PMLs. The relationship between PMLs and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) was also confirmed using published lung cancer datasets. The biomarker performed well predicting the presence of PMLs (AUC = 0.92, n = 17), and changes in the biomarker score associated with progression/stability versus regression of PMLs (AUC = 0.75, n = 51). Conclusions: Transcriptomic alterations in the airway field of smokers with PMLs reflect metabolic and early lung SCC alterations and may be leveraged to stratify smokers at high risk for PML progression and monitor outcome in chemoprevention trials. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - The use of gene panel sequence for diagnostic and prognostic testing is now widespread, but there are so far few objective tests of methods to interpret these data. We describe the design and implementation of a gene panel sequencing data analysis pipeline (VarP) and its assessment in a CAGI4 community experiment. The method was applied to clinical gene panel sequencing data of 106 patients, with the goal of determining which of 14 disease classes each patient has and the corresponding causative variant(s). The disease class was correctly identified for 36 cases, including 10 where the original clinical pipeline did not find causative variants. For a further seven cases, we found strong evidence of an alternative disease to that tested. Many of the potentially causative variants are missense, with no previous association with disease, and these proved the hardest to correctly assign pathogenicity or otherwise. Post analysis showed that three-dimensional structure data could have helped for up to half of these cases. Over-reliance on HGMD annotation led to a number of incorrect disease assignments. We used a largely ad hoc method to assign probabilities of pathogenicity for each variant, and there is much work still to be done in this area. © 2017 The Authors. **Human Mutation published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In the past, short protein-coding genes were often disregarded by genome annotation pipelines. Transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) signals outside of annotated genes have usually been interpreted to indicate either ncRNA or pervasive transcription. Therefore, in addition to the transcriptome, the translatome (RIBOseq) of the enteric pathogen Escherichia coli O157: H7 strain Sakai was determined at two optimal growth conditions and a severe stress condition combining low temperature and high osmotic pressure. All intergenic open reading frames potentially encoding a protein of 30 amino acids were investigated with regard to coverage by transcription and translation signals and their translatability expressed by the ribosomal coverage value. This led to discovery of 465 unique, putative novel genes not yet annotated in this E. coli strain, which are evenly distributed over both DNA strands of the genome. For 255 of the novel genes, annotated homologs in other bacteria were found, and a machine-learning algorithm, trained on small protein-coding E. coli genes, predicted that 89% of these translated open reading frames represent bona fide genes. The remaining 210 putative novel genes without annotated homologs were compared to the 255 novel genes with homologs and to 250 short annotated genes of this E. coli strain. All three groups turned out to be similar with respect to their translatability distribution, fractions of differentially regulated genes, secondary structure composition, and the distribution of evolutionary constraint, suggesting that both novel groups represent legitimate genes. However, the machine-learning algorithm only recognized a small fraction of the 210 genes without annotated homologs. It is possible that these genes represent a novel group of genes, which have unusual features dissimilar to the genes of the machine-learning algorithm training set. © 2017 Hücker et al.

AB  - Background: Gene-fusion or chimeric transcripts have been implicated in the onset and progression of a variety of cancers. Massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the cellular transcriptome is a promising approach for the identification of chimeric transcripts of potential functional significance. We report here the development and use of an integrated computational pipeline for the de novo assembly and characterization of chimeric transcripts in 55 primary breast cancer and normal tissue samples. Methods: An integrated computational pipeline was employed to screen the transcriptome of breast cancer and control tissues for high-quality RNA-sequencing reads. Reads were de novo assembled into contigs followed by reference genome mapping. Chimeric transcripts were detected, filtered and characterized using our R-SAP algorithm. The relative abundance of reads was used to estimate levels of gene expression. Results: De novo assembly allowed for the accurate detection of 1959 chimeric transcripts to nucleotide level resolution and facilitated detailed molecular characterization and quantitative analysis. A number of the chimeric transcripts are of potential functional significance including 79 novel fusion-protein transcripts and many chimeric transcripts with alterations in their un-translated leader regions. A number of chimeric transcripts in the cancer samples mapped to genomic regions devoid of any known genes. Several 'pro-neoplastic' fusions comprised of genes previously implicated in cancer are expressed at low levels in normal tissues but at high levels in cancer tissues. Conclusions: Collectively, our results underscore the utility of deep sequencing technologies and improved bioinformatics workflows to uncover novel and potentially significant chimeric transcripts in cancer and normal somatic tissues. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - A major aim of cancer genomics is to pinpoint which somatically mutated genes are involved in tumor initiation and progression. We introduce a new framework for uncovering cancer genes, differential mutation analysis, which compares the mutational profiles of genes across cancer genomes with their natural germline variation across healthy individuals. We present DiffMut, a fast and simple approach for differential mutational analysis, and demonstrate that it is more effective in discovering cancer genes than considerably more sophisticated approaches. We conclude that germline variation across healthy human genomes provides a powerful means for characterizing somatic mutation frequency and identifying cancer driver genes.

AB  - RNA-binding proteins recognize RNA sequences and structures, but there is currently no systematic and accurate method to derive large (>12 base) motifs de novo that reflect a combination of intrinsic preference to both sequence and structure. To address this absence, we introduce RNAcompete-S, which couples a single-step competitive binding reaction with an excess of random RNA 40-mers to a custom computational pipeline for interrogation of the bound RNA sequences and derivation of SSMs (Sequence and Structure Models). RNAcompete-S confirms that HuR, QKI, and SRSF1 prefer binding sites that are single stranded, and recapitulates known 8–10 bp sequence and structure preferences for Vts1p and RBMY. We also derive an 18-base long SSM for Drosophila SLBP, which to our knowledge has not been previously determined by selections from pure random sequence, and accurately discriminates human replication-dependent histone mRNAs. Thus, RNAcompete-S enables accurate identification of large, intrinsic sequence-structure specificities with a uniform assay. © 2017

AB  - Motivation: In recent years we have witnessed an increase in novel RNA-seq based techniques for transcriptomics analysis. Spatial transcriptomics is a novel RNA-seq based technique that allows spatial mapping of transcripts in tissue sections. The spatial resolution adds an extra level of complexity, which requires the development of new tools and algorithms for efficient and accurate data processing.
Results: Here we present a pipeline to automatically and efficiently process RNA-seq data obtained from spatial transcriptomics experiments to generate datasets for downstream analysis.

AB  - DNase I Hypersensitive sites (DHS) are the regions that are sensitive to cleavage by the DNase I enzyme. Knowledge regarding these sites is helpful for decryption of the functions of non-coding genomic regions. Various biological processes need its intervention. Traditional techniques are laborious and time-consuming to predict DHS sites. Particularly, with the avalanche of DNA sequences generated in the post-genomic era, the development of computational approaches is highly essential to precisely and timely predict DHS sites in DNA sequences. The existing feature encoding schemes such as pseudo dinucleotide composition, pseudo trinucleotide composition etc. cannot effectively express features from DHS sequences. In the current study, we proposed a new computational technique to predict DHS sites which uses Un-biased Pseudo Trinucleotide Composition (Unb-PseTNC) strategy to extract nominal descriptors from the DHS benchmark dataset and avoid biasness among the classes during the classification phase. Several classification algorithm including Support vector machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network and k-nearest neighbor are employed to classify extracted features. It was observed that SVM in conjunction with Unb-PseTNC outperforms other techniques. By comparing with other existing predictors, it was perceived that our proposed method achieved higher prediction rates by applying rigorous jackknife test. This indicates that the proposed model will become a useful tool to predict DHS sites and can also be utilized for in-depth study of DNA and genome analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Although most human cancers display a single histology, there are unusual cases where two or more distinct tissue types present within a primary tumor. One such example is metaplastic breast carcinoma, a rare but aggressive cancer with a heterogeneous histology, including squamous, chondroid, and spindle cells. Metaplastic carcinomas often contain an admixed conventional ductal invasive or in situ mammary carcinoma component, and are typically triple-negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2 amplification/overexpression. An unanswered question is the origin of metaplastic breast cancers. While they may arise independently from their ductal components, their close juxtaposition favors a model that postulates a shared origin, either as two derivatives from the same primary cancer or one histology as an outgrowth of the other. Understanding the mechanism of development of these tumors may inform clinical decisions. Experimental Design: We performed exome sequencing for paired metaplastic and adjacent conventional invasive ductal carcinomas in 8 patients and created a pipeline to identify somatic variants and predict their functional impact, without having normal tissue. We then determined the genetic relationships between the histologically distinct compartments. Results: In each case, the tumor components have nearly identical landscapes of somatic mutation, implying that the differing histologies do not derive from genetic clonal divergence. Conclusions: A shared origin for tumors with differing histologies suggests that epigenetic or noncoding changes may mediate the metaplastic phenotype and that alternative therapeutic approaches, including epigenetic therapies, may be required for metaplastic breast cancers. ©2017 AACR.

AB  - Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is among the most severe forms of congenital heart disease. Although the consensus view is that reduced flow through the left heart during development is a key factor in the development of the condition, the molecular mechanisms leading to hypoplasia of left heart structures are unknown. We have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from five HLHS patients and two unaffected controls, differentiated these to cardiomyocytes and identified reproducible in vitro cellular and functional correlates of the HLHS phenotype. Our data indicate that HLHS-iPSC have a reduced ability to give rise to mesodermal, cardiac progenitors and mature cardiomyocytes and an enhanced ability to differentiate to smooth muscle cells. HLHS-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are characterised by a lower beating rate, disorganised sarcomeres and sarcoplasmic reticulum and a blunted response to isoprenaline. Whole exome sequencing of HLHS fibroblasts identified deleterious variants in NOTCH receptors and other genes involved in the NOTCH signalling pathway. Our data indicate that the expression of NOTCH receptors was significantly downregulated in HLHS-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytesalongside NOTCH target genes confirming downregulation of NOTCH signalling activity. Activation of NOTCH signalling via addition of Jagged peptide ligand during the differentiation of HLHS-iPSC restored their cardiomyocyte differentiation capacity and beating rate and suppressed the smooth muscle cell formation. Together, our data provide firm evidence for involvement of NOTCH signalling in HLHS pathogenesis, reveal novel genetic insights important for HLHS pathology and shed new insights into the role of this pathway during human cardiac development. © The Author 2017.

AB  - Complex changes in gene expression typically mediate a large portion of a cellular response. Each gene may change expression with unique kinetics as the gene is regulated by the particular timing of one of many stimuli, signaling pathways or secondary effects. In order to capture the entire gene expression response to hypoxia in the yeast S. cerevisiae, RNA-seq analysis was used to monitor the mRNA levels of all genes at specific times after exposure to hypoxia. Hypoxia was established by growing cells in ~100% N2 gas. Importantly, unlike other hypoxic studies, ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids were not added to the media because these metabolites affect gene expression. Time points were chosen in the range of 0 - 4 h after hypoxia because that period captures the major changes in gene expression. At each time point, mid-log hypoxic cells were quickly filtered and frozen, limiting exposure to O2 and concomitant changes in gene expression. Total RNA was extracted from cells and used to enrich for mRNA, which was then converted to cDNA. From this cDNA, multiplex libraries were created and eight or more samples were sequenced in one lane of a next-generation sequencer. A post-sequencing pipeline is described, which includes quality base trimming, read mapping and determining the number of reads per gene. DESeq2 within the R statistical environment was used to identify genes that change significantly at any one of the hypoxic time points. Analysis of three biological replicates revealed high reproducibility, genes of differing kinetics and a large number of expected O2-regulated genes. These methods can be used to study how the cells of various organisms respond to hypoxia over time and adapted to study gene expression during other cellular responses. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - Background: A single bout of exercise induces changes in gene expression in skeletal muscle. Regular exercise results in an adaptive response involving changes in muscle architecture and biochemistry, and is an effective way to manage and prevent common human diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disorders and type II diabetes. However, the biomolecular mechanisms underlying such responses still need to be fully elucidated. Here we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of skeletal muscle tissue in a large cohort of untrained Thoroughbred horses (n=51) before and after a bout of high-intensity exercise and again after an extended period of training. We hypothesized that regular high-intensity exercise training primes the transcriptome for the demands of high-intensity exercise. Results: An extensive set of genes was observed to be significantly differentially regulated in response to a single bout of high-intensity exercise in the untrained cohort (3241 genes) and following multiple bouts of high-intensity exercise training over a six-month period (3405 genes). Approximately one-third of these genes (1025) and several biological processes related to energy metabolism were common to both the exercise and training responses. We then developed a novel network-based computational analysis pipeline to test the hypothesis that these transcriptional changes also influence the contextual molecular interactome and its dynamics in response to exercise and training. The contextual network analysis identified several important hub genes, including the autophagosomal-related gene GABARAPL1, and dynamic functional modules, including those enriched for mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and V, that were differentially regulated and had their putative interactions 're-wired' in the exercise and/or training responses. Conclusion: Here we have generated for the first time, a comprehensive set of genes that are differentially expressed in Thoroughbred skeletal muscle in response to both exercise and training. These data indicate that consecutive bouts of high-intensity exercise result in a priming of the skeletal muscle transcriptome for the demands of the next exercise bout. Furthermore, this may also lead to an extensive 're-wiring' of the molecular interactome in both exercise and training and include key genes and functional modules related to autophagy and the mitochondrion. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are commonly used to identify key regulatory networks that drive transcriptional programs. Although these technologies are frequently used in biological studies, NGS data analysis remains a challenging, time-consuming, and often irreproducible process. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive and flexible workflow platform that can accelerate data processing and analysis so more time can be spent on functional studies. Results: We have developed an integrative, stand-alone workflow platform, named CIPHER, for the systematic analysis of several commonly used NGS datasets including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, MNase-seq, DNase-seq, GRO-seq, and ATAC-seq data. CIPHER implements various open source software packages, in-house scripts, and Docker containers to analyze and process single-ended and pair-ended datasets. CIPHER's pipelines conduct extensive quality and contamination control checks, as well as comprehensive downstream analysis. A typical CIPHER workflow includes: (1) raw sequence evaluation, (2) read trimming and adapter removal, (3) read mapping and quality filtering, (4) visualization track generation, and (5) extensive quality control assessment. Furthermore, CIPHER conducts downstream analysis such as: narrow and broad peak calling, peak annotation, and motif identification for ChIP-seq, differential gene expression analysis for RNA-seq, nucleosome positioning for MNase-seq, DNase hypersensitive site mapping, site annotation and motif identification for DNase-seq, analysis of nascent transcription from Global-Run On (GRO-seq) data, and characterization of chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq datasets. In addition, CIPHER contains an "analysis" mode that completes complex bioinformatics tasks such as enhancer discovery and provides functions to integrate various datasets together. Conclusions: Using public and simulated data, we demonstrate that CIPHER is an efficient and comprehensive workflow platform that can analyze several NGS datasets commonly used in genome biology studies. Additionally, CIPHER's integrative "analysis" mode allows researchers to elicit important biological information from the combined dataset analysis. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - RNA sequencing studies with complex designs and transcript-resolution analyses involve multiple hypotheses per gene; however, conventional approaches fail to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at gene level. We propose stageR, a two-stage testing paradigm that leverages the increased power of aggregated gene-level tests and allows post hoc assessment for significant genes. This method provides gene-level FDR control and boosts power for testing interaction effects. In transcript-level analysis, it provides a framework that performs powerful gene-level tests while maintaining biological interpretation at transcript-level resolution. The procedure is applicable whenever individual hypotheses can be aggregated, providing a unified framework for complex high-throughput experiments. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Cultivated chrysanthemum is an outcrossing hexaploid (2n = 6× = 54) with a disputed mode of inheritance. In this paper, we present a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection pipeline that was used to design an Affymetrix Axiom array with 183 k SNPs from RNA sequencing data (1). With this array, we genotyped four bi-parental populations (with sizes of 405, 53, 76 and 37 offspring plants respectively), and a cultivar panel of 63 genotypes. Further, we present a method for dosage scoring in hexaploids from signal intensities of the array based on mixture models (2) and validation of selection steps in the SNP selection pipeline (3). The resulting genotypic data is used to draw conclusions on the mode of inheritance in chrysanthemum (4), and to make an inference on allelic expression bias (5). Results: With use of the mixture model approach, we successfully called the dosage of 73,936 out of 183,130 SNPs (40.4%) that segregated in any of the bi-parental populations. To investigate the mode of inheritance, we analysed markers that segregated in the large bi-parental population (n = 405). Analysis of segregation of duplex x nulliplex SNPs resulted in evidence for genome-wide hexasomic inheritance. This evidence was substantiated by the absence of strong linkage between markers in repulsion, which indicated absence of full disomic inheritance. We present the success rate of SNP discovery out of RNA sequencing data as affected by different selection steps, among which SNP coverage over genotypes and use of different types of sequence read mapping software. Genomic dosage highly correlated with relative allele coverage from the RNA sequencing data, indicating that most alleles are expressed according to their genomic dosage. Conclusions: The large population, genotyped with a very large number of markers, is a unique framework for extensive genetic analyses in hexaploid chrysanthemum. As starting point, we show conclusive evidence for genome-wide hexasomic inheritance. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Coding/functional SNPs change the biological function of a gene and, therefore, could serve as "large-effect" genetic markers. In this study, we used two bioinformatics pipelines, GATK and SAMtools, for discovering coding/functional SNPs with allelic-imbalances associated with total body weight, muscle yield, muscle fat content, shear force, and whiteness. Phenotypic data were collected for approximately 500 fish, representing 98 families (5 fish/family), from a growth-selected line, and the muscle transcriptome was sequenced from 22 families with divergent phenotypes (4 low- versus 4 high-ranked families per trait). Results: GATK detected 59,112 putative SNPs; of these SNPs, 4798 showed allelic imbalances (>2.0 as an amplification and <0.5 as loss of heterozygosity). SAMtools detected 87,066 putative SNPs; and of them, 4962 had allelic imbalances between the low- and high-ranked families. Only 1829 SNPs with allelic imbalances were common between the two datasets, indicating significant differences in algorithms. The two datasets contained 7930 non-redundant SNPs of which 4439 mapped to 1498 protein-coding genes (with 6.4% non-synonymous SNPs) and 684 mapped to 295 lncRNAs. Validation of a subset of 92 SNPs revealed 1) 86.7-93.8% success rate in calling polymorphic SNPs and 2) 95.4% consistent matching between DNA and cDNA genotypes indicating a high rate of identifying SNPs with allelic imbalances. In addition, 4.64% SNPs revealed random monoallelic expression. Genome distribution of the SNPs with allelic imbalances exhibited high density for all five traits in several chromosomes, especially chromosome 9, 20 and 28. Most of the SNP-harboring genes were assigned to important growth-related metabolic pathways. Conclusion: These results demonstrate utility of RNA-Seq in assessing phenotype-associated allelic imbalances in pooled RNA-Seq samples. The SNPs identified in this study were included in a new SNP-Chip design (available from Affymetrix) for genomic and genetic analyses in rainbow trout. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Acupuncture is reported to be effective in treating obesity related illnesses, but its mechanism is still unclear. To investigate this mechanism we applied electro-acupuncture (EA) in a mouse model of obesity and used RNA-seq to identify molecular consequences. Deletion of the transcription factor STAT5 from neurons (Stat5NKO) led to obesity. Acupuncture, in turn, reduced body weight and the ratio of epididymal white adipose tissue (Epi-WAT) to body weight, and it also decreased plasma concentrations of glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol. In addition, EA increased cold endurance of Stat5NKO obese mice. EA reversed altered gene expressions in the hypothalamus and Epi-WAT, especially in the hypothalamus in Stat5NKO obese mice. This study provides, for the first time, insight into genomic networks of obesity and their modulation by electro-acupuncture, which in turn reveals potential mechanisms that explain acupuncture-induced weight-loss. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

AB  - Processing of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data requires significant technical skills, involving installation, configuration, and execution of bioinformatics data pipelines, in addition to specialized postanalysis visualization and data mining software. In order to address some of these challenges, developers have leveraged virtualization containers toward seamless deployment of preconfigured bioinformatics software and pipelines on any computational platform. We present an approach for abstracting the complex data operations of multistep, bioinformatics pipelines for NGS data analysis. As examples, we have deployed 2 pipelines for RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, preconfigured within Docker virtualization containers we call Bio-Docklets. Each Bio-Docklet exposes a single data input and output endpoint and from a user perspective, running the pipelines as simply as running a single bioinformatics tool. This is achieved using a "meta-script" that automatically starts the Bio-Docklets and controls the pipeline execution through the BioBlend software library and the Galaxy Application Programming Interface. The pipeline output is postprocessed by integration with the Visual Omics Explorer framework, providing interactive data visualizations that users can access through a web browser. Our goal is to enable easy access to NGS data analysis pipelines for nonbioinformatics experts on any computing environment, whether a laboratory workstation, university computer cluster, or a cloud service provider. Beyond end users, the Bio-Docklets also enables developers to programmatically deploy and run a large number of pipeline instances for concurrent analysis of multiple datasets. © The Author 2017.

AB  - miRPursuit is a pipeline developed for running end-to-end analyses of high-throughput small RNA (sRNA) sequence data in model and nonmodel plants, from raw data to identified and annotated conserved and novel sequences. It consists of a series of UNIX shell scripts, which connect open-source sRNA analysis software. The involved parameters can be combined with convenient workflow management by users without advanced computational skills. miRPursuit presents several advantages when compared to other tools, including the possibility of processing several sRNA libraries in parallel, thus easily allowing a comparison of the differences in sRNA read accumulation among sRNA libraries. We validate miRPursuit by using datasets from a model plant and discuss its performance with the analysis of sRNAs from non-model species. © 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies

AB  - Summary: Whole exome sequencing (WES) is widely utilized both in translational cancer genomics studies and in the setting of precision medicine. Stratification of individual's ethnicity is fundamental for the correct interpretation of personal genomic variation impact. We implemented EthSEQ to provide reliable and rapid ethnicity annotation from whole exome sequencing individual's data, validated it on 1000 Genome Project and TCGA data (2700 samples) demonstrating high precision, and finally assessed computational performances compared to other tools. EthSEQ can be integrated into any WES based processing pipeline and exploits multi-core capabilities. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ciliopathies are a group of rare disorders characterized by a high genetic and phenotypic variability, which complicates their molecular diagnosis. Hence the need to use the latest powerful approaches to faster identify the genetic defect in these patients. We applied whole exome sequencing to six consanguineous families clinically diagnosed with ciliopathy-like disease, and for which mutations in predominant Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) genes had previously been excluded. Our strategy, based on first applying several filters to ciliary variants and using many of the bioinformatics tools available, allowed us to identify causal mutations in BBS2, ALMS1 and CRB1 genes in four families, thus confirming the molecular diagnosis of ciliopathy. In the remaining two families, after first rejecting the presence of pathogenic variants in common cilia-related genes, we adopted a new filtering strategy combined with prioritisation tools to rank the final candidate genes for each case. Thus, we propose CORO2B, LMO7 and ZNF17 as novel candidate ciliary genes, but further functional studies will be needed to confirm their role. Our data show the usefulness of this strategy to diagnose patients with unclear phenotypes, and therefore the success of applying such technologies to achieve a rapid and reliable molecular diagnosis, improving genetic counselling for these patients. In addition, the described pipeline also highlights the common pitfalls associated to the large volume of data we have to face and the difficulty of assigning a functional role to these changes, hence the importance of designing the most appropriate strategy according to each case. © 2017 Castro-Sánchez et al.

AB  - The objective of the present study is to describe a cohort of complex esophageal atresia and the yield of genetic tests performed for such patients. We selected 45 patients with complex esophageal atresia (EA), namely those having at least one associated anomaly. We reviewed their medical records to assess clinical features, other diagnoses, and genetic investigations. Most of the patients had a diagnosis of VACTERL association (56%) with no genetic variant identified. Interestingly, 5 patients in the cohort (11%) had a right pulmonary hypoplasia or agenesis. A majority of our cohort (73%) had genetic testing; 60% were karyotyped (abnormal in 4 of the 27 patients tested), 31% had aCGH (abnormal in 1 of the 14 patients tested), and 31% had diepoxybutane (DEB) testing for Fanconi anemia (abnormal in 2 of the 14 patients tested). One patient had exome sequencing studies, but no candidate gene was identified. Various anomalies were associated with EA, and overall a genetic variant could be identified in 7 of the 33 patients tested. Chromosomal studies such as aCGH and chromosomal breakage studies should be considered, and their yield varied between 7 and 14%. Other genetic investigations such as exome sequencing could possibly have even higher yields but will need to be assessed in a large cohort. Improved genetic diagnoses in EA may improve the management of these patients by directing specific surveillance and management schemes. © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Viral metagenomics (viromics) can provide a great contribution in expanding the knowledge of viruses and the relationship with their hosts. Viromic studies on marine organisms are still at a very early stage and only little efforts have been spent in the identification of viruses associated to marine invertebrates to date, leaving the complexity of marine viromes associated to bivalve hosts almost completely unexplored. However, the potential use of viromic approaches in the management of viral diseases affecting aquacultured species has been recently evidenced by the flourishing of studies on the Ostreid herpesvirus type-1, which has been associated with bivalve mortality events. Herein we discuss an effective pipeline to retrieve and reconstruct nearly complete and previously unreported viral genomes from existing host RNA-seq data. As a case study, we report the identification of seven RNA-virus genomes within the frame of a highly diversified viral community that characterizes both Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus galloprovincialis samples collected from the lagoon of Goro (Italy). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Genomic rearrangements that give rise to oncogenic gene fusions can offer actionable targets for cancer therapy. Here we present a systematic analysis of oncogenic gene fusions among a clinically well-characterized, prospectively collected set of 278 primary colon cancers spanning diverse tumor stages and clinical outcomes. Gene fusions and somatic genetic variations were identified in fresh frozen clinical specimens by Illumina RNA-sequencing, the STAR fusion gene detection pipeline, and GATK RNA-seq variant calling. We considered gene fusions to be pathogenically relevant when recurrent, producing divergent gene expression (outlier analysis), or as functionally important (e.g., kinase fusions). Overall, 2.5% of all specimens were defined as harboring a relevant gene fusion (kinase fusions 1.8%). Novel configurations of BRAF, NTRK3, and RET gene fusions resulting from chromosomal translocations were identified. An R-spondin fusion was found in only one tumor (0.35%), much less than an earlier reported frequency of 10% in colorectal cancers. We also found a novel fusion involving USP9X-ERAS formed by chromothripsis and leading to high expression of ERAS, a constitutively active RAS protein normally expressed only in embryonic stem cells. This USP9X–ERAS fusion appeared highly oncogenic on the basis of its ability to activate AKT signaling. Oncogenic fusions were identified only in lymph node–negative tumors that lacked BRAF or KRAS mutations. In summary, we identified several novel oncogenic gene fusions in colorectal cancer that may drive malignant development and offer new targets for personalized therapy. ©2017 AACR.

AB  - Background: Insecticide resistance is a substantial problem in controlling agricultural and medical pests. Detecting target site mutations is crucial to manage insecticide resistance. Though PCR-based methods have been widely used in this field, they are time-consuming and inefficient, and typically have a high false positive rate. Acetylcholinesterases (Ace) is the neural target of the widely used organophosphate (OP) and carbamate insecticides. However, there is not any software available to detect insecticide resistance associated mutations in RNA-Seq data at present. Results: A computational pipeline ACE was developed to detect resistance mutations of ace in insect RNA-Seq data. Known ace resistance mutations were collected and used as a reference. We constructed a Web server for ACE, and the standalone software in both Linux and Windows versions is available for download. ACE was used to analyse 971 RNA-Seq data from 136 studies in 7 insect pests. The mutation frequency of each RNA-Seq dataset was calculated. The results indicated that the resistance frequency was 30%-44% in an eastern Ugandan Anopheles population, thus suggesting this resistance-conferring mutation has reached high frequency in these mosquitoes in Uganda. Analyses of RNA-Seq data from the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella indicated that the G227A mutation was positively related with resistance levels to organophosphate or carbamate insecticides. The wasp Nasonia vitripennis had a low frequency of resistant reads (<5%), but the agricultural pests Chilo suppressalis and Bemisia tabaci had a high resistance frequency. All ace reads in the 30 B. tabaci RNA-Seq data were resistant reads, suggesting that insecticide resistance has spread to very high frequency in B. tabaci. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, the ACE pipeline is the first tool to detect resistance mutations from RNA-Seq data, and it facilitates the full utilization of large-scale genetic data obtained by using next-generation sequencing. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) is now commonly used to reveal quantitative spatiotemporal snapshots of the transcriptome, the structures of transcripts (splice variants and fusions) and landscapes of expressed mutations. However, standard approaches for library construction typically require relatively high amounts of input RNA, are labor intensive, and are time consuming. Methods: Here, we report the outcome of a systematic effort to optimize and streamline steps in strand-specific RNA-seq library construction. Results: This work has resulted in the identification of an optimized messenger RNA isolation protocol, a potent reverse transcriptase for cDNA synthesis, and an efficient chemistry and a simplified formulation of library construction reagents. We also present an optimization of bead-based purification and size selection designed to maximize the recovery of cDNA fragments. Conclusions: These developments have allowed us to assemble a rapid high throughput pipeline that produces high quality data from amounts of total RNA as low as 25 ng. While the focus of this study is on RNA-seq sample preparation, some of these developments are also relevant to other next-generation sequencing library types. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Efforts to resolve the transcribed sequences in the equine genome have focused on protein-coding RNA. The transcription of the intergenic regions, although detected via total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), has yet to be characterized in the horse. The most recent equine transcriptome based on RNA-seq from several tissues was a prime opportunity to obtain a concurrent long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) database. Results: This lncRNA database has a breadth of eight tissues and a depth of over 20 million reads for select tissues, providing the deepest and most expansive equine lncRNA database. Utilizing the intergenic reads and three categories of novel genes from a previously published equine transcriptome pipeline, we better describe these groups by annotating the lncRNA candidates. These lncRNA candidates were filtered using an approach adapted from human lncRNA annotation, which removes transcripts based on size, expression, protein-coding capability and distance to the start or stop of annotated protein-coding transcripts. Conclusion: Our equine lncRNA database has 20,800 transcripts that demonstrate characteristics unique to lncRNA including low expression, low exon diversity and low levels of sequence conservation. These candidate lncRNA will serve as a baseline lncRNA annotation and begin to describe the RNA-seq reads assigned to the intergenic space in the horse. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - RNA structures are hierarchically organized. The secondary structure is articulated around sophisticated local three-dimensional (3D) motifs shaping the full 3D architecture of the molecule. Recent contributions have identified and organized recurrent local 3D motifs, but applications of this knowledge for predictive purposes is still in its infancy. We recently developed a computational framework, named RNA-MoIP, to reconcile RNA secondary structure and local 3D motif information available in databases. In this paper, we introduce a web service using our software for predicting RNA hybrid 2D-3D structures from sequence data only. Optionally, it can be used for (i) local 3D motif prediction or (ii) the refinement of user-defined secondary structures. Importantly, our web server automatically generates a script for the MC-Sym software, which can be immediately used to quickly predict all-atom RNA 3D models. ©The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Background: Maternal and paternal high-fat (HF) diet intake before and/or during pregnancy increases mammary cancer risk in several preclinical models. We studied if maternal consumption of a HF diet that began at a time when the fetal primordial germ cells travel to the genital ridge and start differentiating into germ cells would result in a transgenerational inheritance of increased mammary cancer risk. Methods: Pregnant C57BL/6NTac mouse dams were fed either a control AIN93G or isocaloric HF diet composed of corn oil high in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids between gestational days 10 and 20. Offspring in subsequent F1-F3 generations were fed only the control diet. Results: Mammary tumor incidence induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene was significantly higher in F1 (p < 0.016) and F3 generation offspring of HF diet-fed dams (p < 0.040) than in the control offspring. Further, tumor latency was significantly shorter (p < 0.028) and burden higher (p < 0.027) in F1 generation HF offspring, and similar trends were seen in F3 generation HF offspring. RNA sequencing was done on normal mammary glands to identify signaling differences that may predispose to increased breast cancer risk by maternal HF intake. Analysis revealed 1587 and 4423 differentially expressed genes between HF and control offspring in F1 and F3 generations, respectively, of which 48 genes were similarly altered in both generations. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis validated 13 chosen up- and downregulated genes in F3 HF offspring, but only downregulated genes in F1 HF offspring. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified upregulation of Notch signaling as a key alteration in HF offspring. Further, knowledge-fused differential dependency network analysis identified ten node genes that in the HF offspring were uniquely connected to genes linked to increased cancer risk (ANKEF1, IGFBP6, SEMA5B), increased resistance to cancer treatments (SLC26A3), poor prognosis (ID4, JAM3, TBX2), and impaired anticancer immunity (EGR3, ZBP1). Conclusions: We conclude that maternal HF diet intake during pregnancy induces a transgenerational increase in offspring mammary cancer risk in mice. The mechanisms of inheritance in the F3 generation may be different from the F1 generation because significantly more changes were seen in the transcriptome. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to search for transcriptional biomarkers for β 2 -agonists. In combination with drug mechanisms, a smaller group of genes with higher detection accuracy was screened out. Unknown samples were first predicted by this group of genes, and liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) was applied to positive samples to validate the biomarkers. The results of principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and discriminant analysis (DA) indicated that the eight genes screened by high-throughput RNA-seq were able to distinguish samples in the experimental group and control group. Compared with the nine genes selected from an earlier literature, 17 genes including these nine genes were proven to have a more satisfactory effect, which validated the accuracy of gene selection by RNA-seq. Then, six key genes were selected from the 17 genes according to the variable importance in projection (VIP) value of greater than 1. The test results using the six genes and 17 genes were similar, revealing that the six genes were critical genes. By using the six genes, three positive samples possibly treated with drugs were screened out from 25 unknown samples through DA and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Then, the three samples were verified by a standard method, and mapenterol was detected in a sample. Therefore, the six genes can be used as biomarkers to detect β 2 -agonists. Compared with the previous study, accurate detection of β 2 -agonists abuse using six key genes is an improvement method, which show great significance in the monitoring of β 2 -agonists abuse in animal husbandry. © 2017 Zhao et al.

AB  - We present 'Threshold-seq,' a new approach for determining thresholds in deepsequencing datasets of short RNA transcripts. Threshold-seq addresses the critical question of how many reads need to support a short RNA molecule in a given dataset before it can be considered different from 'background.' The proposed scheme is easy to implement and incorporate into existing pipelines.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of diverse cellular processes. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have allowed for an unprecedented discovery of novel lncRNAs. To identify functional lncRNAs from thousands of candidates for further functional validation is still a challenging task. Here, we present a novel computational framework, lncFunNet (lncRNA Functional inference through integrated Network) that integrates ChIPseq, CLIP-seq and RNA-seq data to predict, prioritize and annotate lncRNA functions. Inmouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), using lncFunNet we not only recovered most of the functional lncRNAs known to maintain mESC pluripotency but also predicted a plethora of novel functional lncRNAs. Similarly, in mousemyoblast C2C12 cells, applying lncFunNet led to prediction of reservoirs of functional lncRNAs in both proliferating myoblasts (MBs) and differentiating myotubes (MTs). Further analyses demonstrated that these lncRNAs are frequently bound by key transcription factors, interact with miRNAs and constitute key nodes in biological network motifs. Further experimentations validated their dynamic expression profiles and functionality duringmyoblast differentiation. Collectively, our studies demonstrate the use of lncFunNet to annotate and identify functional lncRNAs in a given biological system. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Lipid production in the industrial microalga Nannochloropsis gaditana exceeds that of model algal species and can be maximized by nutrient starvation in batch culture. However, starvation halts growth, thereby decreasing productivity. Efforts to engineer N. gaditana strains that can accumulate biomass and overproduce lipids have previously met with little success. We identified 20 transcription factors as putative negative regulators of lipid production by using RNA-seq analysis of N. gaditana during nitrogen deprivation. Application of a CRISPR-Cas9 reverse-genetics pipeline enabled insertional mutagenesis of 18 of these 20 transcription factors. Knocking out a homolog of fungal Zn(II) 2 Cys 6 -encoding genes improved partitioning of total carbon to lipids from 20% (wild type) to 40-55% (mutant) in nutrient-replete conditions. Knockout mutants grew poorly, but attenuation of Zn(II) 2 Cys 6 expression yielded strains producing twice as much lipid (∼5.0 g m -2 d -1) as that in the wild type (∼2.5 g m -2 d -1) under semicontinuous growth conditions and had little effect on growth. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Electrical remodeling has been reported to play a major role in the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been increasingly recognized as contributors to the pathology of heart diseases. However, the roles and mechanisms of lncRNAs in electrical remodeling during AF remain unknown. In this study, the lncRNA expression profiles of right atria were investigated in AF and non-AF rabbit models by using RNA sequencing technique and validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 99,843 putative new lncRNAs were identified, in which 1220 differentially expressed transcripts exhibited > 2-fold change. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to predict the functions and interactions of the aberrantly expressed genes. On the basis of a series of filtering pipelines, one lncRNA, TCONS_00075467, was selected to explore its effects and mechanisms on electrical remodeling. The atrial effective refractory period was shortened in vivo and the L-type calcium current and action potential duration were decreased in vitro by silencing of TCONS_00075467 with lentiviruses. Besides, the expression of miRNA-328 was negatively correlated with TCONS_00075467. We further demonstrated that TCONS_00075467 could sponge miRNA-328 in vitro and in vivo to regulate the downstream protein coding gene CACNA1C. In addition, miRNA-328 could partly reverse the effects of TCONS_00075467 on electrical remodeling. In summary, dysregulated lncRNAs may play important roles in modulating electrical remodeling during AF. Our study may facilitate the mechanism studies of lncRNAs in AF pathogenesis and provide potential therapeutic targets for AF. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Gains and losses shape the gene complement of animal lineages and are a fundamental aspect of genomic evolution. Acquiring a comprehensive view of the evolution of gene repertoires is limited by the intrinsic limitations of common sequence similarity searches and available databases. Thus, a subset of the gene complement of an organism consists of hidden orthologs, i.e., those with no apparent homology to sequenced animal lineages - mistakenly considered new genes - but actually representing rapidly evolving orthologs or undetected paralogs. Here, we describe Leapfrog, a simple automated BLAST pipeline that leverages increased taxon sampling to overcome long evolutionary distances and identify putative hidden orthologs in large transcriptomic databases by transitive homology. As a case study, we used 35 transcriptomes of 29 flatworm lineages to recover 3427 putative hidden orthologs, some unidentified by OrthoFinder and HaMStR, two common orthogroup inference algorithms. Unexpectedly, we do not observe a correlation between the number of putative hidden orthologs in a lineage and its "average" evolutionary rate. Hidden orthologs do not show unusual sequence composition biases that might account for systematic errors in sequence similarity searches. Instead, gene duplication with divergence of one paralog and weak positive selection appear to underlie hidden orthology in Platyhelminthes. By using Leapfrog, we identify key centrosome-related genes and homeodomain classes previously reported as absent in free-living flatworms, e.g., planarians. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that hidden orthologs comprise a significant proportion of the gene repertoire in flatworms, qualifying the impact of gene losses and gains in gene complement evolution. © 2017 Martín-Durán et al.

AB  - Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans and considered the third most prevalent mycobacterial disease in humans. Secondary bacterial infections in open BU lesions are the main cause of pain, delayed healing and systemic illness, resulting in prolonged hospital stay. Thus, understanding the diversity of bacteria, termed the microbiome, in these open lesions is important for proper treatment. However, adequately studying the human microbiome in a clinical setting can prove difficult when investigating a neglected tropical skin disease due to its rarity and the setting. Methodology/Principal findings: Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we determined the microbial composition of 5 BU lesions, 3 non-BU lesions and 3 healthy skin samples. Although no significant differences in diversity were found between BU and non-BU lesions, the former were characterized by an increase of Bacteroidetes compared to the non-BU wounds and the BU lesions also contained significantly more obligate anaerobes. With this molecular-based study, we were also able to detect bacteria that were missed by culture-based methods in previous BU studies. Conclusions/Significance: Our study suggests that BU may lead to changes in the skin bacterial community within the lesions. However, in order to determine if such changes hold true across all BU cases and are either a cause or consequence of a specific wound environment, further microbiome studies are necessary. Such skin microbiome analysis requires large sample sizes and lesions from the same body site in many patients, both of which can be difficult for a rare disease. Our study proposes a pipeline for such studies and highlights several drawbacks that must be considered if microbiome analysis is to be utilized for neglected tropical diseases. © 2017 Van Leuvenhaege et al.

AB  - Objective: To perform whole exome sequencing in 928 Hispanic children and identify variants and genes associated with childhood obesity. Methods: Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified from Illumina whole exome sequencing data using integrated read mapping, variant calling, and an annotation pipeline (Mercury). Association analyses of 74 obesity-related traits and exonic variants were performed using SeqMeta software. Rare autosomal variants were analyzed using gene-based association analyses, and common autosomal variants were analyzed at the SNV level. Results: (1) Rare exonic variants in 10 genes and 16 common SNVs in 11 genes that were associated with obesity traits in a cohort of Hispanic children were identified, (2) novel rare variants in peroxisome biogenesis factor 1 (PEX1) associated with several obesity traits (weight, weight z score, BMI, BMI z score, waist circumference, fat mass, trunk fat mass) were discovered, and (3) previously reported SNVs associated with childhood obesity were replicated. Conclusions: Convergence of whole exome sequencing, a family-based design, and extensive phenotyping discovered novel rare and common variants associated with childhood obesity. Linking PEX1 to obesity phenotypes poses a novel mechanism of peroxisomal biogenesis and metabolism underlying the development of childhood obesity. © 2017 The Obesity Society

AB  - This study investigates the challenge of comprehensively cataloging the complete human proteome from a single-cell type using mass spectrometry (MS)-based shotgun proteomics. We modify a classical two-dimensional high-resolution reversed-phase peptide fractionation scheme and optimize a protocol that provides sufficient peak capacity to saturate the sequencing speed of modern MS instruments. This strategy enables the deepest proteome of a human single-cell type to date, with the HeLa proteome sequenced to a depth of ∼584,000 unique peptide sequences and ∼14,200 protein isoforms (∼12,200 protein-coding genes). This depth is comparable with next-generation RNA sequencing and enables the identification of post-translational modifications, including ∼7,000 N-acetylation sites and ∼10,000 phosphorylation sites, without the need for enrichment. We further demonstrate the general applicability and clinical potential of this proteomics strategy by comprehensively quantifying global proteome expression in several different human cancer cell lines and patient tissue samples. © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: The 15 sibling species of the Paramecium aurelia cryptic species complex emerged after a whole genome duplication that occurred tens of millions of years ago. Given extensive knowledge of the genetics and epigenetics of Paramecium acquired over the last century, this species complex offers a uniquely powerful system to investigate the consequences of whole genome duplication in a unicellular eukaryote as well as the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that drive speciation. High quality Paramecium gene models are important for research using this system. The major aim of the work reported here was to build an improved gene annotation pipeline for the Paramecium lineage. Results: We generated oriented RNA-Seq transcriptome data across the sexual process of autogamy for the model species Paramecium tetraurelia. We determined, for the first time in a ciliate, candidate P. tetraurelia transcription start sites using an adapted Cap-Seq protocol. We developed TrUC, multi-threaded Perl software that in conjunction with TopHat mapping of RNA-Seq data to a reference genome, predicts transcription units for the annotation pipeline. We used EuGene software to combine annotation evidence. The high quality gene structural annotations obtained for P. tetraurelia were used as evidence to improve published annotations for 3 other Paramecium species. The RNA-Seq data were also used for differential gene expression analysis, providing a gene expression atlas that is more sensitive than the previously established microarray resource. Conclusions: We have developed a gene annotation pipeline tailored for the compact genomes and tiny introns of Paramecium species. A novel component of this pipeline, TrUC, predicts transcription units using Cap-Seq and oriented RNA-Seq data. TrUC could prove useful beyond Paramecium, especially in the case of high gene density. Accurate predictions of 3' and 5' UTR will be particularly valuable for studies of gene expression (e.g. nucleosome positioning, identification of cis regulatory motifs). The P. tetraurelia improved transcriptome resource, gene annotations for P. tetraurelia, P. biaurelia, P. sexaurelia and P. caudatum, and Paramecium-trained EuGene configuration are available through ParameciumDB ( http://paramecium.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr ).

AB  - Background: The understanding of genomic and physiological mechanisms related to how organisms living in extreme environments survive and reproduce is an outstanding question facing evolutionary and organismal biologists. One interesting example of adaptation is related to the survival of mammals in deserts, where extreme water limitation is common. Research on desert rodent adaptations has focused predominantly on adaptations related to surviving dehydration, while potential reproductive physiology adaptations for acute and chronic dehydration have been relatively neglected. This study aims to explore the reproductive consequences of acute dehydration by utilizing RNAseq data in the desert-specialized cactus mouse (Peromyscus eremicus). Results: We exposed 22 male cactus mice to either acute dehydration or control (fully hydrated) treatment conditions, quasimapped testes-derived reads to a cactus mouse testes transcriptome, and then evaluated patterns of differential transcript and gene expression. Following statistical evaluation with multiple analytical pipelines, nine genes were consistently differentially expressed between the hydrated and dehydrated mice. We hypothesized that male cactus mice would exhibit minimal reproductive responses to dehydration; therefore, this low number of differentially expressed genes between treatments aligns with current perceptions of this species' extreme desert specialization. However, these differentially expressed genes include Insulin-like 3 (Insl3), a regulator of male fertility and testes descent, as well as the solute carriers Slc45a3 and Slc38a5, which are membrane transport proteins that may facilitate osmoregulation. Conclusions: These results suggest that in male cactus mice, acute dehydration may be linked to reproductive modulation via Insl3, but not through gene expression differences in the subset of other a priori tested reproductive hormones. Although water availability is a reproductive cue in desert-rodents exposed to chronic drought, potential reproductive modification via Insl3 in response to acute water-limitation is a result which is unexpected in an animal capable of surviving and successfully reproducing year-round without available external water sources. Indeed, this work highlights the critical need for integrative research that examines every facet of organismal adaptation, particularly in light of global climate change, which is predicted, amongst other things, to increase climate variability, thereby exposing desert animals more frequently to the acute drought conditions explored here. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Transcriptomic approaches (microarray and RNA-seq) have been a tremendous advance for molecular science in all disciplines, but they have made interpretation of hypothesis testing more difficult because of the large number of comparisons that are done within an experiment. The result has been a proliferation of techniques aimed at solving the multiple comparisons problem, techniques that have focused primarily on minimizing Type I error with little or no concern about concomitant increases in Type II errors. We have previously proposed a novel approach for setting statistical thresholds with applications for high throughput omics-data, optimal α, which minimizes the probability of making either error (i.e. Type I or II) and eliminates the need for post-hoc adjustments. Results: A meta-analysis of 242 microarray studies extracted from the peer-reviewed literature found that current practices for setting statistical thresholds led to very high Type II error rates. Further, we demonstrate that applying the optimal α approach results in error rates as low or lower than error rates obtained when using (i) no post-hoc adjustment, (ii) a Bonferroni adjustment and (iii) a false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment which is widely used in transcriptome studies. Conclusions: We conclude that optimal α can reduce error rates associated with transcripts in both microarray and RNA-seq experiments, but point out that improved statistical techniques alone cannot solve the problems associated with high throughput datasets - these approaches need to be coupled with improved experimental design that considers larger sample sizes and/or greater study replication. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The Xenopus community has embraced recent advances in sequencing technology, resulting in the accumulation of numerous RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq datasets. However, easily accessing and comparing datasets generated by multiple laboratories is challenging. Thus, we have created a central space to view, search and analyze data, providing essential information on gene expression changes and regulatory elements present in the genome. XenMine (www.xenmine.org) is a user-friendly website containing published genomic datasets from both Xenopus tropicalis and Xenopus laevis. We have established an analysis pipeline where all published datasets are uniformly processed with the latest genome releases. Information from these datasets can be extracted and compared using an array of pre-built or custom templates. With these search tools, users can easily extract sequences for all putative regulatory domains surrounding a gene of interest, identify the expression values of a gene of interest over developmental time, and analyze lists of genes for gene ontology terms and publications. Additionally, XenMine hosts an in-house genome browser that allows users to visualize all available ChIP-Seq data, extract specifically marked sequences, and aid in identifying important regulatory elements within the genome. Altogether, XenMine is an excellent tool for visualizing, accessing and querying analyzed datasets rapidly and efficiently. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 is the natural producer of acarbose, which is used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type II. However, until now the transcriptional organization and regulation of the acarbose biosynthesis are only understood rudimentarily. The genome sequence of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 was known before, but was resequenced in this study to remove assembly artifacts and incorrect base callings. The annotation of the genome was refined in a multi-step approach, including modern bioinformatic pipelines, transcriptome and proteome data. A whole transcriptome RNA-seq library as well as an RNA-seq library enriched for primary 5′-ends were used for the detection of transcription start sites, to correct tRNA predictions, to identify novel transcripts like small RNAs and to improve the annotation through the correction of falsely annotated translation start sites. The transcriptome data sets were also applied to identify 31 cis-regulatory RNA structures, such as riboswitches or RNA thermometers as well as three leaderless transcribed short peptides found in putative attenuators upstream of genes for amino acid biosynthesis. The transcriptional organization of the acarbose biosynthetic gene cluster was elucidated in detail and fourteen novel biosynthetic gene clusters were suggested. The accurate genome sequence and precise annotation of the Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 genome will be the foundation for future genetic engineering and systems biology studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as a class of factors that are important for regulating development and cancer. Computational prediction of lncRNAs from ultra-deep RNA sequencing has been successful in identifying candidate lncRNAs. However, the complexity of handling and integrating different types of genomics data poses significant challenges to experimental laboratories that lack extensive genomics expertise. Result: To address this issue, we have developed lncRNA-screen, a comprehensive pipeline for computationally screening putative lncRNA transcripts over large multimodal datasets. The main objective of this work is to facilitate the computational discovery of lncRNA candidates to be further examined by functional experiments. lncRNA-screen provides a fully automated easy-to-run pipeline which performs data download, RNA-seq alignment, assembly, quality assessment, transcript filtration, novel lncRNA identification, coding potential estimation, expression level quantification, histone mark enrichment profile integration, differential expression analysis, annotation with other type of segmented data (CNVs, SNPs, Hi-C, etc.) and visualization. Importantly, lncRNA-screen generates an interactive report summarizing all interesting lncRNA features including genome browser snapshots and lncRNA-mRNA interactions based on Hi-C data. Conclusion: lncRNA-screen provides a comprehensive solution for lncRNA discovery and an intuitive interactive report for identifying promising lncRNA candidates. lncRNA-screen is available as open-source software on GitHub. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Planktothricoides is a free-living filamentous cyanobacterium belonging to the order Oscillatoriales and the family Phormidiaceae, capable of forming bloom in fresh and brackish waters. A unicyanobacterial non-axenic culture dominated by Planktothricoides sp. SR001 was obtained from a freshwater reservoir in Singapore. The draft genome presented here is the first tropical freshwater Planktothricoides sp. ever sequenced. The genome of 7.0Mbp contains 5,776 genes predicted using the JGI IMG pipeline. The whole genome sequence allows identification of genes encoding for nitrogen-fixation, accessory photosynthetic pigments and biosynthesis of an off-flavor compound, 2-methylisoborneol, which has been experimentally verified here based on metabolite detection. In addition, strain SR001 genome contains an operon putatively involved in the production of a linear tripeptide cyanobactin related to viridisamide A and aeruginosamide, with the later known to possess anti-microbial or cytotoxic effect. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Dictyostelium discoideum, a soil-dwelling social amoeba, is a model for the study of numerous biological processes. Research in the field has benefited mightily from the adoption of next-generation sequencing for genomics and transcriptomics. Dictyostelium biologists now face the widespread challenges of analyzing and exploring high dimensional data sets to generate hypotheses and discovering novel insights. Results: We present dictyExpress (2.0), a web application designed for exploratory analysis of gene expression data, as well as data from related experiments such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). The application features visualization modules that include time course expression profiles, clustering, gene ontology enrichment analysis, differential expression analysis and comparison of experiments. All visualizations are interactive and interconnected, such that the selection of genes in one module propagates instantly to visualizations in other modules. dictyExpress currently stores the data from over 800 Dictyostelium experiments and is embedded within a general-purpose software framework for management of next-generation sequencing data. dictyExpress allows users to explore their data in a broader context by reciprocal linking with dictyBase-a repository of Dictyostelium genomic data. In addition, we introduce a companion application called GenBoard, an intuitive graphic user interface for data management and bioinformatics analysis. Conclusions: dictyExpress and GenBoard enable broad adoption of next generation sequencing based inquiries by the Dictyostelium research community. Labs without the means to undertake deep sequencing projects can mine the data available to the public. The entire information flow, from raw sequence data to hypothesis testing, can be accomplished in an efficient workspace. The software framework is generalizable and represents a useful approach for any research community. To encourage more wide usage, the backend is open-source, available for extension and further development by bioinformaticians and data scientists. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The advent of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has led to the discovery of unprecedentedly immense transcriptomes encoded by eukaryotic genomes. However, the transcriptome maps are still incomplete partly because they were mostly reconstructed based on RNA-seq reads that lack their orientations (known as unstranded reads) and certain boundary information. Methods to expand the usability of unstranded RNA-seq data by predetermining the orientation of the reads and precisely determining the boundaries of assembled transcripts could significantly benefit the quality of the resulting transcriptome maps. Here, we present a high-performing transcriptome assembly pipeline, called CAFE, that significantly improves the original assemblies, respectively assembled with stranded and/or unstranded RNA-seq data, by orienting unstranded reads using the maximum likelihood estimation and by integrating information about transcription start sites and cleavage and polyadenylation sites. Applying large-scale transcriptomic data comprising 230 billion RNA-seq reads from the ENCODE, Human BodyMap 2.0, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and GTEx projects, CAFE enabled us to predict the directions of about 220 billion unstranded reads, which led to the construction of more accurate transcriptome maps, comparable to the manually curated map, and a comprehensive lncRNA catalog that includes thousands of novel lncRNAs. Our pipeline should not only help to build comprehensive, precise transcriptome maps from complex genomes but also to expand the universe of noncoding genomes. © 2017 Tranchevent et al.

AB  - The wide range of RNA-seq applications and their high-computational needs require the development of pipelines orchestrating the entire workflow and optimizing usage of available computational resources. We present aRNApipe, a project-oriented pipeline for processing of RNA-seq data in high-performance cluster environments. aRNApipe is highly modular and can be easily migrated to any high-performance computing (HPC) environment. The current applications included in aRNApipe combine the essential RNA-seq primary analyses, including quality control metrics, transcript alignment, count generation, transcript fusion identification, alternative splicing and sequence variant calling. aRNApipe is project-oriented and dynamic so users can easily update analyses to include or exclude samples or enable additional processing modules. Workflow parameters are easily set using a single configuration file that provides centralized tracking of all analytical processes. Finally, aRNApipe incorporates interactive web reports for sample tracking and a tool for managing the genome assemblies available to perform an analysis. © The Author 2017.

AB  - Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of cellular functions and physiology. Yet functional lincRNAs often have low, context-specific and tissue-specific expression. We hypothesized that many human monocyte and adipose lincRNAs would be absent in current public annotations due to lincRNA tissue specificity, modest sequencing depth in public data, limitations of transcriptome assembly algorithms, and lack of dynamic physiological contexts. Deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed in peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes (monocytes; average ~247 million reads per sample) and adipose tissue (average ~378 million reads per sample) collected before and after human experimental endotoxemia, an in vivo inflammatory stress, to identify tissue-specific and clinically relevant lincRNAs. Using a stringent filtering pipeline, we identified 109 unannotated lincRNAs in monocytes and 270 unannotated lincRNAs in adipose. Most unannotated lincRNAs are not conserved in rodents and are tissue specific, while many have features of regulated expression and are enriched in transposable elements. Specific subsets have enhancer RNA characteristics or are expressed only during inflammatory stress. A subset of unannotated lincRNAs was validated and replicated for their presence and inflammatory induction in independent human samples and for their monocyte and adipocyte origins. Through interrogation of public genome-wide association data, we also found evidence of specific disease association for selective unannotated lincRNAs. Our findings highlight the critical need to perform deep RNA-Seq in a cell-, tissue-, and context-specific manner to annotate the full repertoire of human lincRNAs for a complete understanding of lincRNA roles in dynamic cell functions and in human disease. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - The use of RNA-seq as the preferred method for the discovery and validation of small RNA biomarkers has been hindered by high quantitative variability and biased sequence counts. In this paper we develop a statistical model for sequence counts that accounts for ligase bias and stochastic variation in sequence counts. This model implies a linear quadratic relation between the mean and variance of sequence counts. Using a large number of sequencing datasets, we demonstrate how one can use the generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) distributional regression framework to calculate and apply empirical correction factors for ligase bias. Bias correction could remove more than 40% of the bias for miRNAs. Empirical bias correction factors appear to be nearly constant over at least one and up to four orders of magnitude of total RNA input and independent of sample composition. Using synthetic mixes of known composition, we show that the GAMLSS approach can analyze differential expression with greater accuracy, higher sensitivity and specificity than six existing algorithms (DESeq2, edgeR, EBSeq, limma, DSS, voom) for the analysis of small RNA-seq data. © The Authors 2017.

AB  - Single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing has recently been used to obtain full-length cDNA sequences that improve genome annotation and reveal RNA isoforms. Here, we used one such method called isoform sequencing from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) to sequence a cDNA library from the Asian malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi. More than 600 000 full-length cDNAs, referred to as reads of insert, were identified. Owing to the inherently high error rate of PacBio sequencing, we tested different approaches for error correction. We found that error correction using Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) generated more data than using the default SMRT pipeline. The full-length error-corrected PacBio reads greatly improved the gene annotation of Anopheles stephensi: 4867 gene models were updated and 1785 alternatively spliced isoforms were added to the annotation. In addition, six trans-splicing events, where exons from different primary transcripts were joined together, were identified in An. stephensi. All six trans-splicing events appear to be conserved in Culicidae, as they are also found in Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti. The proteins encoded by trans-splicing events are also highly conserved and the orthologues of these proteins are cis-spliced in outgroup species, indicating that trans-splicing may arise as a mechanism to rescue genes that broke up during evolution. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society

AB  - Motivation: Global analysis of translation regulation has recently been enabled by the development of Ribosome Profiling, or Ribo-seq, technology. This approach provides maps of ribosome activity for each expressed gene in a given biological sample. Measurements of translation efficiency are generated when Ribo-seq data is analyzed in combination with matched RNA-seq gene expression profiles. Existing computational methods for identifying genes with differential translation across samples are based on sound principles, but require users to choose between accuracy and speed. Results: We present Riborex, a computational tool for mapping genome-wide differences in translation efficiency. Riborex shares a similar mathematical structure with existing methods, but has a simplified implementation. Riborex directly leverages established RNA-seq analysis frameworks for all parameter estimation, providing users with a choice among robust engines for these computations. The result is a method that is dramatically faster than available methods without sacrificing accuracy. © The Author 2017.

AB  - The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is the first tool in the annotation of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. BLAST is a flagship of bioinformatics due to its performance and user-friendliness. Beginners and intermediate users will learn how to design and submit blastn and Megablast searches on the Web pages at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. We map nucleic acid sequences to genomes, find identical or similar mRNAs, expressed sequence tag, and noncoding RNA sequences, and run Megablast searches, which are much faster than blastn. Understanding results is assisted by taxonomy reports, genomic views, and multiple alignments. We interpret expected frequency thresholds, biological significance, and statistical significance. Weak hits provide no evidence, but indicate hints for further analyses. We find genes that may code for homologous proteins by translated BLAST. We reduce false positives by filtering out low-complexity regions. Parsed BLAST results can be integrated into analysis pipelines. Links in the output connect to Entrez and PubMed, as well as structural, sequence, interaction, and expression databases. This facilitates integration with a wide spectrum of biological knowledge. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Background: Heterogeneity of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) has been characterized using whole-genome mRNA expression data, showing distinct molecular and clinicopathological characteristics by subtypes. However, associations between risk factors and molecular subtypes have not been reported. Methods: Four previously published schemes were used to categorize molecular subtypes in 372 MIBC patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Data on gene expression (RNA-seq), demographic, and clinicopathological characteristics were retrieved through TCGA data portal. Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate the associations of subtypes by different schemes with age at diagnosis, obesity, and smoking. Results: While some quantitative variation was evident, distinct molecular subtype schemes showed considerable consistency in the association with the risk factors. Generally, compared to patients with luminal-like tumors, patients with basal-like subtypes were more likely to be older (OR75 + yrs vs. &lt;60 years range = 1.32–2.89), obese (ORobese vs. normal range = 1.30–3.05), and to start smoking at early age (OR&lt;18 years vs. 25+ years range = 1.11–4.57). Conclusions: Different molecular subtypes of MIBC may have distinct risk profiles. Large population-based studies with detailed information on bladder cancer risk factors are needed to further define etiologic heterogeneity for bladder cancer. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Recently, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has revealed compelling details about the small RNA (sRNA) population in eukaryotes. These 20 to 25 nt noncoding RNAs can influence gene expression by acting as guides for the sequence-specific regulatory mechanism known as RNA silencing. The increase in sequencing depth and number of samples per project enables a better understanding of the role sRNAs play by facilitating the study of expression patterns. However, the intricacy of the biological hypotheses coupled with a lack of appropriate tools often leads to inadequate mining of the available data and thus, an incomplete description of the biological mechanisms involved. To enable a comprehensive study of differential expression in sRNA data sets, we present a new interactive pipeline that guides researchers through the various stages of data preprocessing and analysis. This includes various tools, some of which we specifically developed for sRNA analysis, for quality checking and normalization of sRNA samples as well as tools for the detection of differentially expressed sRNAs and identification of the resulting expression patterns. The pipeline is available within the UEA sRNA Workbench, a user-friendly software package for the processing of sRNA data sets. We demonstrate the use of the pipeline on a H. sapiens data set; additional examples on a B. terrestris data set and on an A. thaliana data set are described in the Supplemental Information. A comparison with existing approaches is also included, which exemplifies some of the issues that need to be addressed for sRNA analysis and how the new pipeline may be used to do this. © 2017 Beckers et al.

AB  - Drosophila melanogaster is an outstanding model to study the molecular and functional basis of host-pathogen interactions. Currently, our knowledge of microbial infections in D. melanogaster is well understood; however, the response of flies to nematode infections is still in its infancy. Here, we have used the potent parasitic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae, which lives in mutualism with its endosymbiotic bacteria Xenorhabdus nematophila, to examine the transcriptomic basis of the interaction between D. melanogaster and entomopathogenic nematodes. We have employed next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to investigate the transcriptomic profile of D. melanogaster larvae in response to infection by S. carpocapsae symbiotic (carrying X. nematophila) or axenic (lacking X. nematophila) nematodes. Bioinformatic analyses have identified the strong induction of genes that are associated with the peritrophic membrane and the stress response, as well as several genes that participate in developmental processes. We have also found that genes with different biological functions are enriched in D. melanogaster larvae responding to either symbiotic or axenic nematodes. We further show that while symbiotic nematode infection enriched certain known immune-related genes, axenic nematode infection enriched several genes associated with chitin binding, lipid metabolic functions, and neuroactive ligand receptors. In addition, we have identified genes with a potential role in nematode recognition and genes with potential antinematode activity. Findings from this study will undoubtedly set the stage for the identification of key regulators of antinematode immune mechanisms in D. melanogaster, as well as in other insects of socioeconomic importance. © 2017 Yadav et al.

AB  - A comprehensive repertoire of human microRNAs (miRNAs) that could be involved in early melanoma invasion into the dermis remains unknown. To this end, we sequenced small RNAs (18-30 nucleotides) isolated from an annotated series of invasive melanomas (average invasive depth, 2.0 mm), common melanocytic nevi, and matched normal skin (n=28). Our previously established bioinformatics pipeline identified 765 distinct mature known miRNAs and defined a set of top 40 list that clearly segregated melanomas into thin (0.75 mm) and thick (2.7 mm) groups. Among the top, miR-21-5p, let-7b-5p, let-7a-5p, miR-424-5p, miR-423-5p, miR-21-3p, miR-199b-5p, miR-182-5p, and miR-205-5p were differentially expressed between thin and thick melanomas. In a validation cohort (n=167), measured expression of miR-21-5p and miR-424-5p, not previously reported in melanoma, were significantly increased in invasive compared with in situ melanomas (P<0.0001). Increased miR-21-5p levels were significantly associated with invasive depth (P=0.038), tumor mitotic index (P=0.038), lymphovascular invasion (P=0.0036), and AJCC stage (P=0.038). In contrast, let-7b levels were significantly decreased in invasive and in situ melanomas compared with common and dysplastic nevi (P<0.0001). Decreased let-7b levels were significantly associated with invasive depth (P=0.011), Clark's level (P=0.013), ulceration (P=0.0043), and AJCC stage (P=0.011). These results define a distinct set of miRNAs associated with invasive and aggressive melanoma phenotype. © 2017 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs, are key regulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional level and play essential roles in biological processes such as development. MiRNAs silence target mRNAs by binding to complementary sequences in the 3′untranslated regions (3′UTRs). The parasitic helminths of the genus Echinococcus are the causative agents of echinococcosis, a zoonotic neglected disease. In previous work, we performed a comprehensive identification and characterization of Echinococcus miRNAs. However, current knowledge about their targets is limited. Since target prediction algorithms rely on complementarity between 3′UTRs and miRNA sequences, a major limitation is the lack of accurate sequence information of 3′UTR for most species including parasitic helminths. We performed RNA-seq and developed a pipeline that integrates the transcriptomic data with available genomic data of this parasite in order to identify 3′UTRs of Echinococcus canadensis. The high confidence set of 3′UTRs obtained allowed the prediction of miRNA targets in Echinococcus through a bioinformatic approach. We performed for the first time a comparative analysis of miRNA targets in Echinococcus and Taenia. We found that many evolutionarily conserved target sites in Echinococcus and Taenia may be functional and under selective pressure. Signaling pathways such as MAPK and Wnt were among the most represented pathways indicating miRNA roles in parasite growth and development. Genome-wide identification and characterization of miRNA target genes in Echinococcus provide valuable information to guide experimental studies in order to understand miRNA functions in the parasites biology. miRNAs involved in essential functions, especially those being absent in the host or showing sequence divergence with respect to host orthologs, might be considered as novel therapeutic targets for echinococcosis control. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Genome-wide loss-of-function profiling is widely used for systematic identification of genetic dependencies in cancer cells; however, the poor reproducibility of RNA interference (RNAi) screens has been a major concern due to frequent off-target effects. Currently, a detailed understanding of the key factors contributing to the sub-optimal consistency is still a lacking, especially on how to improve the reliability of future RNAi screens by controlling for factors that determine their off-target propensity. Methods: We performed a systematic, quantitative analysis of the consistency between two genome-wide shRNA screens conducted on a compendium of cancer cell lines, and also compared several gene summarization methods for inferring gene essentiality from shRNA level data. We then devised novel concepts of seed essentiality and shRNA family, based on seed region sequences of shRNAs, to study in-depth the contribution of seed-mediated off-target effects to the consistency of the two screens. We further investigated two seed-sequence properties, seed pairing stability, and target abundance in terms of their capability to minimize the off-target effects in post-screening data analysis. Finally, we applied this novel methodology to identify genetic interactions and synthetic lethal partners of cancer drivers, and confirmed differential essentiality phenotypes by detailed CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. Results: Using the novel concepts of seed essentiality and shRNA family, we demonstrate how genome-wide loss-of-function profiling of a common set of cancer cell lines can be actually made fairly reproducible when considering seed-mediated off-target effects. Importantly, by excluding shRNAs having higher propensity for off-target effects, based on their seed-sequence properties, one can remove noise from the genome-wide shRNA datasets. As a translational application case, we demonstrate enhanced reproducibility of genetic interaction partners of common cancer drivers, as well as identify novel synthetic lethal partners of a major oncogenic driver, PIK3CA, supported by a complementary CRISPR/Cas9 experiment. Conclusions: We provide practical guidelines for improved design and analysis of genome-wide loss-of-function profiling and demonstrate how this novel strategy can be applied towards improved mapping of genetic dependencies of cancer cells to aid development of targeted anticancer treatments. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Discordant phenotypes and diseases in Monozygotic twins (MZ) are always intriguing and genetics is the exclusive reason. Down syndrome is one such disorder, which shows heterogeneity, with occurrences of incidental diseases discordant between cases. When such disease discordance is noted in Down syndromic MZ twins, it becomes a true genetic case and the necessity to uncover the pathogenic variants becomes imperative. One such case of MZ twins reported by an earlier study failed to identify the pathogenic variants behind the discordance between Congenital Heart Defect (CHD) and Epilepsy. In the current study, using the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) datasets of the original investigators along with our custom variant identification pipeline, we investigated the consequences of damaging novel and rare discordant mutations in TGFBR2, for CHD; ITPR1 and RYR2 for Epilepsy. TGFBR2 was identified with a frameshift deletion resulting in a stop gain mutation and appeared to be dominant in function causing Ventricular Septal Defect in the older Down syndrome twin, while nonsynonymous heterozygous substitutions was identified in ITPR1 and RYR2, causing epileptic seizures in the younger twin. Pathway analysis on mutant genes revealed disruption of several processes such as vascular septal formation for TGFBR2, and calcium signalling for ITPR1 and RYR2. The present investigation identified novel discordant mutations relevant to the discordant disease presented, using appropriate analysis and pipelines. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We previously reported exome sequencing in a short-rib thoracic dystrophy (SRTD) cohort, in whom recessive mutations were identified in SRTD-associated genes in 10 of 11 cases. A heterozygous stop mutation in the known SRTD gene WDR60 was identified in the remaining case; no novel candidate gene/s were suggested by homozygous/compound heterozygous analysis. This case was thus considered unsolved. Re-analysis following an analysis pipeline update identified a homozygous mutation in C21orf2 (c.218G > C; p.Arg73Pro). This homozygous variant was previously removed at the quality control stage by the default GATK parameter “in-breeding co-efficient.” C21orf2 was recently associated with both Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) and axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (axial SMD); this particular mutation was reported in homozygous and compound heterozygous state in both conditions. Our case has phenotypic features of both JATD and axial SMD; and the extent of thoracic involvement appears more severe than in other C21orf2-positive cases. Identification of a homozygous C21orf2 mutation in this case emphasizes the value of exome sequencing for simultaneously screening known genes and identifying novel genes. Additionally, it highlights the importance of re-interrogating data both as novel gene associations are identified and as analysis pipelines are refined. Finally, the severity of thoracic restriction in this case adds to the phenotypic spectrum attributable to C21orf2 mutations. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: The most common and severe disease causing allele of Alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency (1ATD) is Z-1AT. This protein aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is the main cause of liver disease in childhood. Based on recent evidences and on the frequency of liver disease occurrence in Z-1AT patients, it seems that liver disease progression is linked to still unknown genetic factors. Methods: We used an innovative approach combining yeast genetic screens with next generation exome sequencing to identify and functionally characterize the genes involved in 1ATD associated liver disease. Results: Using yeast genetic screens, we identified HRD1, an Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD) associated protein, as an inducer of Z-mediated toxicity. Whole exome sequencing of 1ATD patients resulted in the identification of two variants associated with liver damages in Z-1AT homozygous cases: HFE H63D and HERPUD1 R50H. Functional characterization in Z-1AT model cell lines demonstrated that impairment of the ERAD machinery combined with the HFE H63D variant expression decreased both cell proliferation and cell viability, while Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)-mediated cell death was hyperstimulated. Conclusion: This powerful experimental pipeline allowed us to identify and functionally validate two genes involved in Z-1AT-mediated severe liver toxicity. This pilot study moves forward our understanding on genetic modifiers involved in 1ATD and highlights the UPR pathway as a target for the treatment of liver diseases associated with 1ATD. Finally, these findings support a larger scale screening for HERPUD1 R50H and HFE H63D variants in the sub-group of 1ATD patients developing significant chronic hepatic injuries (hepatomegaly, chronic cholestasis, elevated liver enzymes) and at risk developing liver cirrhosis. © 2017 Joly et al.

AB  - Identifying differential expressed genes across various conditions or genotypes is the most typical approach to studying the regulation of gene expression. An estimate of gene-specific variance is often needed for the assessment of statistical significance in most differential expression (DE) detection methods, including linear models (e.g., for transformed and normalized microarray data) and generalized linear models (e.g., for count data in RNAseq). Due to a common limit in sample size, the variance estimate is often unstable in small experiments. Shrinkage estimates using empirical Bayes methods have proven useful in improving the variance estimate, hence improving the detection of DE. The most widely used empirical Bayes methods borrow information across genes within the same experiments. In these methods, genes are considered exchangeable or exchangeable conditioning on expression level. We propose, with the increasing accumulation of expression data, borrowing information from historical data on the same gene can provide better estimate of gene-specific variance, thus further improve DE detection. Specifically, we show that the variation of gene expression is truly gene-specific and reproducible between different experiments. We present a new method to establish informative gene-specific prior on the variance of expression using existing public data, and illustrate how to shrink the variance estimate and detect DE. We demonstrate improvement in DE detection under our strategy compared to leading DE detection methods. © 2016, International Chinese Statistical Association.

AB  - Alternative splicing generatesmultiple transcript and protein isoforms from the same gene and thus is important in gene expression regulation. To date, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is the standard method for quantifying changes in alternative splicing on a genome-wide scale. Understanding the current limitations of RNA-seq is crucial for reliable analysis and the lack of high quality, comprehensive transcriptomes for most species, including model organisms such as Arabidopsis, is a major constraint in accurate quantification of transcript isoforms. To address this, we designed a novel pipeline with stringent filters and assembled a comprehensive Reference Transcript Dataset for Arabidopsis (AtRTD2) containing 82,190 non-redundant transcripts from 34 212 genes. Extensive experimental validation showed that AtRTD2 and its modified version, AtRTD2-QUASI, for use in Quantification of Alternatively Spliced Isoforms, outperform other available transcriptomes in RNA-seq analysis. This strategy can be implemented in other species to build a pipeline for transcript-level expression and alternative splicing analyses. © The Authors 2017.

AB  - Experimental evidence indicates that about 60% of miRNA-binding activity does not follow the canonical rule about the seed matching between miRNA and targetmRNAs, but rather a non-canonical miRNA targeting activity outside the seed or with a seed-like motifs. Here, we propose a new unbiased method to identify canonical and non-canonical miRNA-binding sites frompeaks identified by Ago2 Cross-Linked ImmunoPrecipitation associated to high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq). Since the quality of peaks is of pivotal importance for the final output of the proposed method, we provide a comprehensive benchmarking of four peak detection programs, namely CIMS, PIPE-CLIP, Piranha and Pyicoclip, on four publicly available Ago2-HITS-CLIP datasets and one unpublished in-house Ago2-dataset in stem cells. We measured the sensitivity, the specificity and the position accuracy toward miRNA binding sites identification, and the agreement with TargetScan. Secondly, we developed a new pipeline, called miRBShunter, to identify canonical and non-canonical miRNA-binding sites based on de novo motif identification from Ago2 peaks and prediction ofmiRNA::RNA heteroduplexes. miRBShunter was tested and experimentally validated on the in-house Ago2-dataset and on an Ago2-PAR-CLIP dataset in human stem cells. Overall, we provide guidelines to choose a suitable peak detection program and a new method for miRNA-target identification. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are involved in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. In this high-throughput sequencing era, a tremendous amount of RNA-seq data is accumulating, and full utilization of publicly available miRNA data is an important challenge. These data are useful to determine expression values for each miRNA, but quantification pipelines are in a primitive stage and still evolving; there are many factors that affect expression values significantly. Results: We used 304 high-quality microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) datasets from NCBI-SRA and calculated expression profiles for different tissues and cell-lines. In each miRNA-seq dataset, we found an average of more than 500 miRNAs with higher than 5x coverage, and we explored the top five highly expressed miRNAs in each tissue and cell-line. This user-friendly miRmine database has options to retrieve expression profiles of single or multiple miRNAs for a specific tissue or cellline, either normal or with disease information. Results can be displayed in multiple interactive, graphical and downloadable formats. Availability and Implementation: http://guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/mirmine . © The Author 2017.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer (PC) is largely refractory to existing therapies used in unselected patient trials, thus emphasizing the pressing need for new approaches for patient selection in personalized medicine. KRAS mutations occur in 90% of PC patients and confer resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (e.g., panitumumab), suggesting that KRAS wild-type PC patients may benefit from targeted panitumumab therapy. Here, we use tumor tissue procured by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate (EUS-FNA) to compare the in vivo sensitivity in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of KRAS wild-type and mutant PC tumors to panitumumab, and to profile the molecular signature of these tumors in patients with metastatic or localized disease. Specifically, RNASeq of EUS-FNA-derived tumor RNA from localized (n = 20) and metastatic (n = 20) PC cases revealed a comparable transcriptome profile. Screening the KRAS mutation status of tumor genomic DNA obtained from EUS-FNAs stratified PC patients into either KRAS wild-type or mutant cohorts, and the engraftment of representative KRAS wild-type and mutant EUS-FNA tumor samples into NOD/SCID mice revealed that the growth of KRAS wild-type, but not mutant, PDXs was selectively suppressed with panitumumab. Furthermore, in silico transcriptome interrogation of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-derived KRAS wild-type (n = 38) and mutant (n = 132) PC tumors revealed 391 differentially expressed genes. Taken together, our study validates EUS-FNA for the application of a novel translational pipeline comprising KRAS mutation screening and PDXs, applicable to all PC patients, to evaluate personalized anti-EGFR therapy in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors. © 2017 UICC

AB  - Summary: Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data requires the processing of large datasets by chaining various tools with complex input and output formats. In order to automate data analysis, we propose to standardize NGS tasks into modular workflows. This simplifies reliable handling and processing of NGS data, and corresponding solutions become substantially more reproducible and easier to maintain. Here, we present a documented, linux-based, toolbox of 42 processing modules that are combined to construct workflows facilitating a variety of tasks such as DNAseq and RNAseq analysis. We also describe important technical extensions. The high throughput executor (HTE) helps to increase the reliability and to reduce manual interventions when processing complex datasets. We also provide a dedicated binary manager that assists users in obtaining the modules' executables and keeping them up to date. As basis for this actively developed toolbox we use the workflow management software KNIME.

AB  - The hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans is the causal agent of blackleg disease in Brassica napus (canola, oilseed rape) and causes significant loss of yield worldwide. While genetic resistance has been used to mitigate the disease by means of traditional breeding strategies, there is little knowledge about the genes that contribute to blackleg resistance. RNA sequencing and a streamlined bioinformatics pipeline identified unique genes and plant defense pathways specific to plant resistance in the B. napus–L. maculans LepR1–AvrLepR1 interaction over time. We complemented our temporal analyses by monitoring gene activity directly at the infection site using laser microdissection coupled to quantitative PCR. Finally, we characterized genes involved in plant resistance to blackleg in the Arabidopsis–L. maculans model pathosystem. Data reveal an accelerated activation of the plant transcriptome in resistant host cotyledons associated with transcripts coding for extracellular receptors and phytohormone signaling molecules. Functional characterization provides direct support for transcriptome data and positively identifies resistance regulators in the Brassicaceae. Spatial gradients of gene activity were identified in response to L. maculans proximal to the site of infection. This dataset provides unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution of the genes required for blackleg resistance and serves as a valuable resource for those interested in host–pathogen interactions. © 2017 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Genetic studies have identified many risk loci for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) although causal factors in the majority of cases are still unknown. Currently, known ASD risk genes are all protein-coding genes; however, the vast majority of transcripts in humans are noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) which do not encode proteins. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were shown to be highly expressed in the human brain and crucial for normal brain development. We have constructed a computational pipeline for the integration of various genomic datasets to identify lncRNAs associated with ASD. This pipeline utilizes differential gene expression patterns in affected tissues in conjunction with gene co-expression networks in tissue-matched non-affected samples. We analyzed RNA-seq data from the cortical brain tissues from ASD cases and controls to identify lncRNAs differentially expressed in ASD. We derived a gene co-expression network from an independent human brain developmental transcriptome and detected a convergence of the differentially expressed lncRNAs and known ASD risk genes into specific co-expression modules. Coexpression network analysis facilitates the discovery of associations between previously uncharacterized lncRNAs with known ASD risk genes, affected molecular pathways and atrisk developmental time points. In addition, we show that some of these lncRNAs have a high degree of overlap with major CNVs detected in ASD genetic studies. By utilizing this integrative approach comprised of differential expression analysis in affected tissues and connectivity metrics from a developmental co-expression network, we have prioritized a set of candidate ASD-associated lncRNAs. The identification of lncRNAs as novel ASD susceptibility genes could help explain the genetic pathogenesis of ASD. © 2017 Gudenas et al.

AB  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is widely used to study gene expression changes associated with treatments or biological conditions. Many popular methods for detecting differential expression (DE) from RNA-seq data use generalized linear models (GLMs) fitted to the read counts across independent replicate samples for each gene. This article shows that the standard formula for the residual degrees of freedom (d.f.) in a linear model is overstated when the model contains fitted values that are exactly zero. Such fitted values occur whenever all the counts in a treatment group are zero as well as in more complex models such as those involving paired comparisons. This misspecification results in underestimation of the genewise variances and loss of type I error control. This article proposes a formula for the reduced residual d.f. that restores error control in simulated RNA-seq data and improves detection of DE genes in a real data analysis. The new approach is implemented in the quasi-likelihood framework of the edgeR software package. The results of this article also apply to RNA-seq analyses that apply linear models to log-transformed counts, such as those in the limma software package, and more generally to any count-based GLM where exactly zero fitted values are possible.

AB  - Translational profiling methodologies enable the systematic characterization of cell types in complex tissues, such as the mammalian brain, where neuronal isolation is exceptionally difficult. Here, we report a versatile strategy for profiling CNS cell types in a spatiotemporally restricted fashion by engineering a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus expressing an EGFP-tagged ribosomal protein (AAV-FLEX-EGFPL10a) to access translating mRNAs by translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP). We demonstrate the utility of this AAV to target a variety of genetically and anatomically defined neural populations expressing Cre recombinase and illustrate the ability of this viral TRAP (vTRAP) approach to recapitulate the molecular profiles obtained by bacTRAP in corticothalamic neurons across multiple serotypes. Furthermore, spatially restricting adeno-associated virus (AAV) injections enabled the elucidation of regional differences in gene expression within this cell type. Altogether, these results establish the broad applicability of the vTRAP strategy for the molecular dissection of any CNS or peripheral cell type that can be engineered to express Cre. © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - Motivation: Pseudotime analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data have become increasingly common. Typically, a latent trajectory corresponding to a biological process of interest - such as differentiation or cell cycle - is discovered. However, relatively little attention has been paid to modelling the differential expression of genes along such trajectories. Results: We present switchde, a statistical framework and accompanying R package for identifying switch-like differential expression of genes along pseudotemporal trajectories. Our method includes fast model fitting that provides interpretable parameter estimates corresponding to how quickly a gene is up or down regulated as well as where in the trajectory such regulation occurs. It also reports a P-value in favour of rejecting a constant-expression model for switch-like differential expression and optionally models the zero-inflation prevalent in single-cell data. © 2016 The Author.

AB  - Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a major cause of end-stage renal disease. The disease mechanisms are not well understood and the pathogenesis toward renal failure remains elusive. In this study, we present the first RNASeq analysis of a Pkd1-mutant mouse model in a combined meta-analysis with other published PKD expression profiles. We introduce the PKD Signature, a set of 1,515 genes that are commonly dysregulated in PKD studies. We show that the signature genes include many known and novel PKD-related genes and functions. Moreover, genes with a role in injury repair, as evidenced by expression data and/or automated literature analysis, were significantly enriched in the PKD Signature, with 35% of the PKD Signature genes being directly implicated in injury repair. NF-κB signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, inflammatory response, hypoxia, and metabolism were among the most prominent injury or repairrelated biological processes with a role in the PKD etiology. Novel PKD genes with a role in PKD and in injury were confirmed in another Pkd1-mutant mouse model as well as in animals treated with a nephrotoxic agent. We propose that compounds that can modulate the injury-repair response could be valuable drug candidates for PKD treatment. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) are one of the most economically important parasites of small ruminants and a major animal health concern in many regions of the world. However, the molecular mechanisms of the host response to GIN infections in goat are still little known. In this study, two genetically distinct goat populations, one relatively resistant and the other susceptible to GIN infections, were identified in Yichang goat and then four individuals in each group were chosen to compare mRNA expression profiles using RNA-seq. Field experiment showed lower worm burden, delayed and reduced egg production in the relatively resistant group than the susceptible group. The analysis of RNA-seq showed that 2369 genes, 1407 of which were up-regulated and 962 down-regulated, were significantly (p < 0.001) differentially expressed between these two groups. Functional annotation of the 298 genes more highly expressed in the resistant group yielded a total of 46 significant (p < 0.05) functional annotation clusters including 31 genes (9 in innate immunity, 13 in immunity, and 9 in innate immune response) related to immune biosynthetic process as well as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) pathways. Our findings provide insights that are immediately relevant for the improvement of host resistance to GIN infections and which will make it possible to know the mechanisms underlying the resistance of goats to GIN infections. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is a tightly controlled process that is integral to gene expression. It features intricate and dynamic interactions of the small and large subunits of the ribosome with mRNAs, aided by multiple auxiliary factors during distinct initiation, elongation and termination phases. The recently developed ribosome profiling method can generate transcriptome-wide surveys of translation and its regulation. Ribosome profiling records the footprints of fully assembled ribosomes along mRNAs and thus primarily interrogates the elongation phase of translation. Importantly, it does not monitor multiple substeps of initiation and termination that involve complexes between the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) and mRNA. Here we describe a related method, termed 'translation complex profile sequencing' (TCP-seq), that is uniquely capable of recording positions of any type of ribosome-mRNA complex transcriptome-wide. It uses fast covalent fixation of translation complexes in live cells, followed by RNase footprinting of translation intermediates and their separation into complexes involving either the full ribosome or the SSU. The footprints derived from each type of complex are then deep-sequenced separately, generating native distribution profiles during the elongation, as well as the initiation and termination stages of translation. We provide the full TCP-seq protocol for Saccharomyces cerevisiae liquid suspension culture, including a data analysis pipeline. The protocol takes â 1/43 weeks to complete by a researcher who is well acquainted with standard molecular biology techniques and who has some experience in ultracentrifugation and the preparation of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries. Basic Bash and UNIX/Linux command skills are required to use the bioinformatics tools provided.

AB  - Brown algae have evolved complex multicellularity in the heterokont lineage. They are phylogenetically distant to land plants, fungi and animals. Especially, the members of Laminariales (so-called kelps) have developed highly differentiated tissues. Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays pivotal roles in a number of essential processes in multicellular organisms, such as cell adhesion, cell and tissue differentiations, cell-to-cell communication, and responses to environmental stimuli. In these processes, a set of extracellular secreted proteins called the secretome operates remodeling of the physicochemical nature of ECM and signal transduction by interacting with cell surface proteins and signaling molecules. Characterization of the secretome is a critical step to clarify the contributions of ECM to the multicellularity of brown algae. However, the identity of the brown algal secretome has been poorly understood. In order to reveal the repertory of the brown algal secretome and its involvement in the evolution of Laminariales, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of the brown algal secretome utilizing the published complete genome data of Ectocarpus siliculosus and Saccharina japonica as well as newly obtained RNA-seq data of seven laminarialean species (Agarum clathratum, Alaria crassifolia, Aureophycus aleuticus, Costaria costata, Pseudochorda nagaii, Saccharina angustata and Undaria pinnatifida) largely covering the laminarialean families. We established the in silico pipeline to systematically and accurately detect the secretome by combining multiple prediction algorithms for the N-terminal signal peptide and transmembrane domain within the protein sequence. From 16,189 proteins of E. siliculosus and 18,733 proteins of S. japonica, 552 and 964 proteins respectively were predicted to be classified as the secretome. Conserved domain analysis showed that the domain repertory were very similar to each other, and that of the brown algal secretome was partially common with that of the secretome of other multicellular organisms (land plants, fungi and animals). In the laminarialean species, it was estimated that the gene abundance and the domain architecture of putative ECM remodeling-related proteins were altered compared with those of E. siliculosus, and that the alteration started from the basal group of Laminariales. These results suggested that brown algae have developed their own secretome, and its functions became more elaborated in the more derived members in Laminariales. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cytochrome P450 26A1 (CYP26A1) has a spatiotemporal expression pattern in the uterus, with a significant increase in mRNA and protein levels during peri-implantation. Inhibiting the function or expression of CYP26A1 can cause pregnancy failure, suggesting an important regulatory role of CYP26A1 in the maintenance of pregnancy. However, little is known about the exact mechanism involved. In this study, using a pCR3.1-cyp26a1 plasmid immunization mouse model and a Cyp26a1-MO (Cyp26a1-specific antisense oligos) knockdown mouse model, we report that the number of Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) lectin-positive uterine natural killer (uNK) cells was reduced in pCR3.1-cyp26a1 plasmid immunized and Cyp26a1-MO-treated mice. In contrast, the percentage of CD3− CD49b+ NK cells in the uteri from the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group in both models. Similarly, significantly up-regulated expression of CD49b (a pan-NK cell marker), interferon gamma, CCL2, CCR2 (CCL2 receptor) and CCL3 were detected in the uteri of pCR3.1-cyp26a1- and Cyp26a1-MO-treated mice. Transcriptome analysis suggested that CYP26A1 might regulate NK cells through chemokines. In conclusion, the present data suggest that silencing CYP26A1 expression/function can decrease the number of uNK cells and significantly increase the percentage of CD3− CD49b+ NK cells in the uteri of pregnant mice. These findings provide a new line of evidence correlating the deleterious effects of blocking CYP26A1 in pregnancy with the aberrant regulation of NK cells in the uterus. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Asian soybean rust (ASR), caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi, can cause losses greater than 80%. Despite its economic importance, there is no soybean cultivar with durable ASR resistance. In addition, the P. pachyrhizi genome is not yet available. However, the availability of other rust genomes, as well as the development of sample enrichment strategies and bioinformatics tools, has improved our knowledge of the ASR secretome and its potential effectors. In this context, we used a combination of laser capture microdissection (LCM), RNAseq and a bioinformatics pipeline to identify a total of 36 350 P. pachyrhizi contigs expressed in planta and a predicted secretome of 851 proteins. Some of the predicted secreted proteins had characteristics of candidate effectors: small size, cysteine rich, do not contain PFAM domains (except those associated with pathogenicity) and strongly expressed in planta. A comparative analysis of the predicted secreted proteins present in Pucciniales species identified new members of soybean rust and new Pucciniales- or P. pachyrhizi-specific families (tribes). Members of some families were strongly up-regulated during early infection, starting with initial infection through haustorium formation. Effector candidates selected from two of these families were able to suppress immunity in transient assays, and were localized in the plant cytoplasm and nuclei. These experiments support our bioinformatics predictions and show that these families contain members that have functions consistent with P. pachyrhizi effectors. © 2016 BSPP AND JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD

AB  - In an effort to thwart bacterial pathogens, hosts often limit the availability of nutrients at the site of infection. This limitation can alter the abundances of key metabolites to which regulatory factors respond, adjusting cellular metabolism. In recent years, a number of proteins and RNA have emerged as important regulators of virulence gene expression. For example, the CodY protein responds to levels of branched-chain amino acids and GTP and is widely conserved in low G+C Gram-positive bacteria. As a global regulator in Staphylococcus aureus, CodY controls the expression of dozens of virulence and metabolic genes. We hypothesize that S. aureus uses CodY, in part, to alter its metabolic state in an effort to adapt to nutrient-limiting conditions potentially encountered in the host environment. This manuscript describes a method for extracting and analyzing metabolites from S. aureus using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, a protocol that was developed to test this hypothesis. The method also highlights best practices that will ensure rigor and reproducibility, such as maintaining biological steady state and constant aeration without the use of continuous chemostat cultures. Relative to the USA200 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolate UAMS-1 parental strain, the isogenic codY mutant exhibited significant increases in amino acids derived from aspartate (e.g., threonine and isoleucine) and decreases in their precursors (e.g., aspartate and O-acetylhomoserine). These findings correlate well with transcriptional data obtained with RNA-seq analysis: genes in these pathways were up-regulated between 10- and 800-fold in the codY null mutant. Coupling global analyses of the transcriptome and the metabolome can reveal how bacteria alter their metabolism when faced with environmental or nutritional stress, providing potential insight into the physiological changes associated with nutrient depletion experienced during infection. Such discoveries may pave the way for the development of novel anti-infectives and therapeutics. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - Background: Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition with autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance, which share a distinctive neuroradiological hallmark, the so-called molar tooth sign. JSRD is classified into six clinical subtypes based on associated variable multiorgan involvement. To date, 21 causative genes have been identified in JSRD, which makes genetic diagnosis difficult. Case presentation: We report here a case of a 28-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed with JS with oculorenal defects with a novel compound heterozygous mutation (p.Ser219*/deletion) in the NPHP1 gene. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of the patient identified the novel nonsense mutation in an apparently homozygous state. However, it was absent in her mother and heterozygous in her father. A read depth-based copy number variation (CNV) detection algorithm using WES data of the family predicted a large heterozygous deletion mutation in the patient and her mother, which was validated by digital polymerase chain reaction, indicating that the patient was compound heterozygous for the paternal nonsense mutation and the maternal deletion mutation spanning the site of the single nucleotide change. Conclusion: It should be noted that analytical pipelines that focus purely on sequence information cannot distinguish homozygosity from hemizygosity because of its inability to detect large deletions. The ability to detect CNVs in addition to single nucleotide variants and small insertion/deletions makes WES an attractive diagnostic tool for genetically heterogeneous disorders. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The unveiling of long non-coding RNAs as important gene regulators in many biological contexts has increased the demand for efficient and robust computational methods to identify novel long non-coding RNAs from transcripts assembled with high throughput RNA-seq data. Several classes of sequence-based features have been proposed to distinguish between coding and non-coding transcripts. Among them, open reading frame, conservation scores, nucleotide arrangements, and RNA secondary structure have been used with success in literature to recognize intergenic long non-coding RNAs, a particular subclass of non-coding RNAs.
RESULTS: In this paper we perform a systematic assessment of a wide collection of features extracted from sequence data. We use most of the features proposed in the literature, and we include, as a novel set of features, the occurrence of repeats contained in transposable elements. The aim is to detect signatures (groups of features) able to distinguish long non-coding transcripts from other classes, both protein-coding and non-coding. We evaluate different feature selection algorithms, test for signature stability, and evaluate the prediction ability of a signature with a machine learning algorithm. The study reveals different signatures in human, mouse, and zebrafish, highlighting that some features are shared among species, while others tend to be species-specific. Compared to coding potential tools and similar supervised approaches, including novel signatures, such as those identified here, in a machine learning algorithm improves the prediction performance, in terms of area under precision and recall curve, by 1 to 24%, depending on the species and on the signature.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding which features are best suited for the prediction of long non-coding RNAs allows for the development of more effective automatic annotation pipelines especially relevant for poorly annotated genomes, such as zebrafish. We provide a web tool that recognizes novel long non-coding RNAs with the obtained signatures from fasta and gtf formats.

AB  - Background: Given the rarity of most single-gene Mendelian disorders, concerted efforts of data exchange between clinical and scientific communities are critical to optimize molecular diagnosis and novel disease gene discovery. Methods: We designed and implemented protocols for the study of cases for which a plausible molecular diagnosis was not achieved in a clinical genomics diagnostic laboratory (i.e. unsolved clinical exomes). Such cases were recruited to a research laboratory for further analyses, in order to potentially: (1) accelerate novel disease gene discovery; (2) increase the molecular diagnostic yield of whole exome sequencing (WES); and (3) gain insight into the genetic mechanisms of disease. Pilot project data included 74 families, consisting mostly of parent-offspring trios. Analyses performed on a research basis employed both WES from additional family members and complementary bioinformatics approaches and protocols. Results: Analysis of all possible modes of Mendelian inheritance, focusing on both single nucleotide variants (SNV) and copy number variant (CNV) alleles, yielded a likely contributory variant in 36% (27/74) of cases. If one includes candidate genes with variants identified within a single family, a potential contributory variant was identified in a total of ~51% (38/74) of cases enrolled in this pilot study. The molecular diagnosis was achieved in 30/63 trios (47.6%). Besides this, the analysis workflow yielded evidence for pathogenic variants in disease-associated genes in 4/6 singleton cases (66.6%), 1/1 multiplex family involving three affected siblings, and 3/4 (75%) quartet families. Both the analytical pipeline and the collaborative efforts between the diagnostic and research laboratories provided insights that allowed recent disease gene discoveries (PURA, TANGO2, EMC1, GNB5, ATAD3A, and MIPEP) and increased the number of novel genes, defined in this study as genes identified in more than one family (DHX30 and EBF3). Conclusion: An efficient genomics pipeline in which clinical sequencing in a diagnostic laboratory is followed by the detailed reanalysis of unsolved cases in a research environment, supplemented with WES data from additional family members, and subject to adjuvant bioinformatics analyses including relaxed variant filtering parameters in informatics pipelines, can enhance the molecular diagnostic yield and provide mechanistic insights into Mendelian disorders. Implementing these approaches requires collaborative clinical molecular diagnostic and research efforts. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Carefully designed control experiments provide a gold standard for benchmarking different genomics research tools. A shortcoming of many gene expression control studies is that replication involves profiling the same reference RNA samplemultiple times. This leads to low, pure technical noise that is atypical of regular studies. To achieve a more realistic noise structure, we generated a RNA-sequencing mixture experiment using two cell lines of the same cancer type. Variability was added by extracting RNA from independent cell cultures and degrading particular samples. The systematic gene expression changes induced by this design allowed benchmarking of different library preparation kits (standard poly-A versus total RNA with Ribozero depletion) and analysis pipelines. Data generated using the total RNA kit had more signal for introns and various RNA classes (ncRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and less variability after degradation. For differential expression analysis, voom with quality weights marginally outperformed other popular methods, while for differential splicing, DEXSeq was simultaneously the most sensitive and the most inconsistent method. For sample deconvolution analysis, DeMix outperformed IsoPure convincingly. Our RNA-sequencing data set provides a valuable resource for benchmarking different protocols and data pre-processing workflows. The extra noise mimics routine lab experiments more closely, ensuring any conclusions are widely applicable. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Computational analysis of gene expression to determine both the sequence of lineage choices made by multipotent cells and to identify the genes influencing these decisions is challenging. Here we discover a pattern in the expression levels of a sparse subset of genes among cell types in B- and T-cell developmental lineages that correlates with developmental topologies. We develop a statistical framework using this pattern to simultaneously infer lineage transitions and the genes that determine these relationships. We use this technique to reconstruct the early hematopoietic and intestinal developmental trees. We extend this framework to analyze single-cell RNA-seq data from early human cortical development, inferring a neocortical-hindbrain split in early progenitor cells and the key genes that could control this lineage decision. Our work allows us to simultaneously infer both the identity and lineage of cell types as well as a small set of key genes whose expression patterns reflect these relationships. © Furchtgott et al.

AB  - Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive malignancy of the bile ducts, with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Here, we describe the integrated analysis of somatic mutations, RNA expression, copy number, and DNA methylation by The Cancer Genome Atlas of a set of predominantly intrahepatic CCA cases and propose a molecular classification scheme. We identified an IDH mutant-enriched subtype with distinct molecular features including low expression of chromatin modifiers, elevated expression of mitochondrial genes, and increased mitochondrial DNA copy number. Leveraging the multi-platform data, we observed that ARID1A exhibited DNA hypermethylation and decreased expression in the IDH mutant subtype. More broadly, we found that IDH mutations are associated with an expanded histological spectrum of liver tumors with molecular features that stratify with CCA. Our studies reveal insights into the molecular pathogenesis and heterogeneity of cholangiocarcinoma and provide classification information of potential therapeutic significance. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - It is of urgency to effectively identify differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. In this paper, we proposed a novel method, joint-L2,1-norm-constraint-based semi-supervised feature extraction (L21SFE), to analyze RNA-Seq data. Our scheme was shown as follows. Firstly, we constructed a graph Laplacian matrix and refined it by using the labeled samples. Our graph construction method can make full use of a large number of unlabelled samples. Secondly, we found semi-supervised optimal maps by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. Thirdly, we solved an optimal problem via the joint L2,1-norm constraint to obtain a projection matrix. It can diminish the impact of noises and outliers by using the L2,1-norm constraint and produce more precise results. Finally, we identified differentially expressed genes based on the projection matrix. The results on simulation and real RNA-Seq data sets demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our method. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 17β-Estradiol (E2) is a steroid hormone that negatively affects muscle growth in rainbow trout, but the mechanism associated with this response is not fully understood. To better characterize the effects of E2 on muscle, we identified differentially regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) and muscle atrophy-related transcripts in juvenile rainbow trout exposed to E2. Small RNA-Seq analysis of E2-treated vs. control muscle identified 36 differentially expressed miRNAs including those known to be involved in myogenesis, cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell death. Some important myogenic miRNAs, such as miR-133 and miR-206, are upregulated while others like miR-145 and miR-499, are downregulated. Gene Ontology analysis of the target genes regulated by the miRNAs involved in atrophy and cell cycle indicates that E2 influence leads to expansion of quiescent myogenic precursor cell population to address atrophying mature muscle in rainbow trout during sexual development. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

AB  - Background: The identification of disease-causing variants in autosomal dominant diseases using exome-sequencing data remains a difficult task in small pedigrees. We combined several strategies to improve filtering and prioritizing of heterozygous variants using exome-sequencing datasets in familial Meniere disease: an in-house Pathogenic Variant (PAVAR) score, the Variant Annotation Analysis and Search Tool (VAAST-Phevor), Exomiser-v2, CADD, and FATHMM. We also validated the method by a benchmarking procedure including causal mutations in synthetic exome datasets. Results: PAVAR and VAAST were able to select the same sets of candidate variants independently of the studied disease. In contrast, Exomiser V2 and VAAST-Phevor had a variable correlation depending on the phenotypic information available for the disease on each family. Nevertheless, all the selected diseases ranked a limited number of concordant variants in the top 10 ranking, using the three systems or other combined algorithm such as CADD or FATHMM. Benchmarking analyses confirmed that the combination of systems with different approaches improves the prediction of candidate variants compared with the use of a single method. The overall efficiency of combined tools ranges between 68 and 71% in the top 10 ranked variants. Conclusions: Our pipeline prioritizes a short list of heterozygous variants in exome datasets based on the top 10 concordant variants combining multiple systems. © The Author(s). 2017.

AB  - Lung cancer accounts for the highest fatalities amongst cancers worldwide. Within the frames of the Metaboli-Ca project, we explored the effects of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by utilizing next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Here, we update and expand our previous work; exploiting RNA sequencing data for the derivation of differentially expressed genes and alternatively spliced genes in cancer cells compared to the adjacent normal tissue and carry out functional analysis to discover the underlying molecular mechanisms altered in cancer cells. We used our established pipeline for quantitative analysis, which utilizes a range of state-of-the-art tools, and investigated the modifications performed in cancer cells. A significant number of 1449 genes were found as differentially expressed, while 368 genes as alternatively spliced. Focusing in alternative splicing events, a number of important molecular mechanisms emerged, such as proteasome functionality, stemness, and regulation of mitosis. Our analysis suggests several molecular players that could enhance the understanding of NSCLC pathophysiology. © 2016, IUPESM and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Given the current cost-effectiveness of next-generation sequencing, the amount of DNAseq and RNA-seq data generated is ever increasing. One of the primary objectives of NGS experiments is calling genetic variants. While highly accurate, most variant calling pipelines are not optimized to run efficiently on large data sets. However, as variant calling in genomic data has become common practice, several methods have been proposed to reduce runtime for DNA-seq analysis through the use of parallel computing. Determining the effectively expressed variants from transcriptomics (RNA-seq) data has only recently become possible, and as such does not yet benefit from efficiently parallelized workflows. We introduce Halvade-RNA, a parallel, multi-node RNA-seq variant calling pipeline based on the GATK Best Practices recommendations. Halvade-RNA makes use of the MapReduce programming model to create and manage parallel data streams on which multiple instances of existing tools such as STAR and GATK operate concurrently. Whereas the single-threaded processing of a typical RNA-seq sample requires∼28h, Halvade-RNA reduces this runtime to∼2h using a small cluster with two 20-core machines. Even on a single, multi-core workstation, Halvade-RNA can significantly reduce runtime compared to using multi-threading, thus providing for a more cost-effective processing of RNA-seq data. Halvade-RNA is written in Java and uses the Hadoop MapReduce 2.0 API. It supports a wide range of distributions of Hadoop, including Cloudera and Amazon EMR. © 2017 Decap et al.

AB  - Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) are random oligonucleotide barcodes that are increasingly used in high-throughput sequencing experiments. Through a UMI, identical copies arising from distinct molecules can be distinguished from those arising through PCR amplification of the same molecule. However, bioinformatic methods to leverage the information from UMIs have yet to be formalized. In particular, sequencing errors in the UMI sequence are often ignored or else resolved in an ad hoc manner. We show that errors in the UMI sequence are common and introduce network-based methods to account for these errors when identifying PCR duplicates. Using these methods, we demonstrate improved quantification accuracy both under simulated conditions and real iCLIP and single-cell RNA-seq data sets. Reproducibility between iCLIP replicates and single-cell RNA-seq clustering are both improved using our proposed network-based method, demonstrating the value of properly accounting for errors in UMIs. These methods are implemented in the open source UMI-tools software package. © 2017 Smith et al.

AB  - Grade of membership models, also known as “admixture models”, “topic models” or “Latent Dirichlet Allocation”, are a generalization of cluster models that allow each sample to have membership in multiple clusters. These models are widely used in population genetics to model admixed individuals who have ancestry from multiple “populations”, and in natural language processing to model documents having words from multiple “topics”. Here we illustrate the potential for these models to cluster samples of RNA-seq gene expression data, measured on either bulk samples or single cells. We also provide methods to help interpret the clusters, by identifying genes that are distinctively expressed in each cluster. By applying these methods to several example RNA-seq applications we demonstrate their utility in identifying and summarizing structure and heterogeneity. Applied to data from the GTEx project on 53 human tissues, the approach highlights similarities among biologically-related tissues and identifies distinctively-expressed genes that recapitulate known biology. Applied to single-cell expression data from mouse preimplantation embryos, the approach highlights both discrete and continuous variation through early embryonic development stages, and highlights genes involved in a variety of relevant processes—from germ cell development, through compaction and morula formation, to the formation of inner cell mass and trophoblast at the blastocyst stage. The methods are implemented in the Bioconductor package CountClust. © 2017 Dey et al.

AB  - Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are processed from hairpin-containing primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). However, rules that distinguish pri-miRNAs from other hairpin-containing transcripts in the genome are incompletely understood. By developing a computational pipeline to systematically evaluate 30 structural and sequence features of mammalian RNA hairpins, we report several new rules that are preferentially utilized in miRNA hairpins and govern efficient pri-miRNA processing. We propose that a hairpin stem length of 36 ± 3 nt is optimal for pri-miRNA processing. We identify two bulge-depleted regions on the miRNA stem, located ~16-21 nt and ~28-32 nt from the base of the stem, that are less tolerant of unpaired bases. We further show that the CNNC primary sequence motif selectively enhances the processing of optimal-length hairpins. We predict that a small but significant fraction of human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) alter pri-miRNA processing, and confirm several predictions experimentally including a disease-causing mutation. Our study enhances the rules governing mammalian pri-miRNA processing and suggests a diverse impact of human genetic variation on miRNA biogenesis. © 2017 Blumberg et al.

AB  - Purpose: Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy in the United States, with high rates of recurrence and eventual resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Model systems that allow for accurate and reproducible target discovery and validation are needed to support further drug development in this disease. Experimental Design: Clinically annotated patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were generated from tumor cells isolated from the ascites or pleural fluid of patients undergoing clinical procedures. Models were characterized by IHC and by molecular analyses. Each PDX was luciferized to allow for reproducible in vivo assessment of intraperitoneal tumor burden by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Plasma assays for CA125 and human LINE-1 were developed as secondary tests of in vivo disease burden. Results: Fourteen clinically annotated and molecularly characterized luciferized ovarian PDX models were generated. Luci-ferized PDX models retain fidelity to both the nonluciferized PDX and the original patient tumor, as demonstrated by IHC, array CGH, and targeted and whole-exome sequencing analyses. Models demonstrated diversity in specific genetic alterations and activation of PI3K signaling pathway members. Response of luciferized PDX models to standard-of-care therapy could be reproducibly monitored by BLI or plasma markers. Conclusions: We describe the establishment of a collection of 14 clinically annotated and molecularly characterized luciferized ovarian PDX models in which orthotopic tumor burden in the intraperitoneal space can be followed by standard and reproducible methods. This collection is well suited as a platform for proof-of-concept efficacy and biomarker studies and for validation of novel therapeutic strategies in ovarian cancer. © 2016 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - Background: Molecular signatures identified from high-throughput transcriptomic studies often have poor reliability and fail to reproduce across studies. One solution is to combine independent studies into a single integrative analysis, additionally increasing sample size. However, the different protocols and technological platforms across transcriptomic studies produce unwanted systematic variation that strongly confounds the integrative analysis results. When studies aim to discriminate an outcome of interest, the common approach is a sequential two-step procedure; unwanted systematic variation removal techniques are applied prior to classification methods. Results: To limit the risk of overfitting and over-optimistic results of a two-step procedure, we developed a novel multivariate integration method, MINT, that simultaneously accounts for unwanted systematic variation and identifies predictive gene signatures with greater reproducibility and accuracy. In two biological examples on the classification of three human cell types and four subtypes of breast cancer, we combined high-dimensional microarray and RNA-seq data sets and MINT identified highly reproducible and relevant gene signatures predictive of a given phenotype. MINT led to superior classification and prediction accuracy compared to the existing sequential two-step procedures. Conclusions: MINT is a powerful approach and the first of its kind to solve the integrative classification framework in a single step by combining multiple independent studies.

AB  - Background: Orthology characterizes genes of different organisms that arose from a single ancestral gene via speciation, in contrast to paralogy, which is assigned to genes that arose via gene duplication. An accurate orthology assignment is a crucial step for comparative genomic studies. Orthologous genes in two organisms can be identified by applying a so-called reciprocal search strategy, given that complete information of the organisms' gene repertoire is available. In many investigations, however, only a fraction of the gene content of the organisms under study is examined (e.g., RNA sequencing). Here, identification of orthologous nucleotide or amino acid sequences can be achieved using a graph-based approach that maps nucleotide sequences to genes of known orthology. Existing implementations of this approach, however, suffer from algorithmic issues that may cause problems in downstream analyses. Results: We present a new software pipeline, Orthograph, that addresses and solves the above problems and implements useful features for a wide range of comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses. Orthograph applies a best reciprocal hit search strategy using profile hidden Markov models and maps nucleotide sequences to the globally best matching cluster of orthologous genes, thus enabling researchers to conveniently and reliably delineate orthologs and paralogs from transcriptomic and genomic sequence data. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on de novo-sequenced and assembled transcript libraries of 24 species of apoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) as well as on published genomic datasets. Conclusion: With Orthograph, we implemented a best reciprocal hit approach to reference-based orthology prediction for coding nucleotide sequences such as RNAseq data. Orthograph is flexible, easy to use, open source and freely available at https://mptrsen.github.io/Orthograph. Additionally, we release 24 de novo-sequenced and assembled transcript libraries of apoid wasp species. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are generated by back-splicing of immature RNA forming covalently closed loops of intron/exon RNA molecules. Pervasiveness, evolutionary conservation, massive and regulated expression, and post-transcriptional regulatory roles of circRNAs in eukaryotes have been appreciated and described only recently. Moreover, being easily detectable disease markers, circRNAs undoubtedly represent a molecular class with high bearing on molecular pathobiology. CircRNAs can be detected from RNA-seq data using appropriate computational methods to identify the sequence reads spanning back-splice junctions that do not co-linearly map to the reference genome. To this end, several programs were developed and critical assessment of various strategies and tools suggested the combination of at least two methods as good practice to guarantee robust circRNA detection. Here, we present CirComPara (http://github.com/egaffo/CirComPara), an automated bioinformatics pipeline, to detect, quantify and annotate circRNAs from RNA-seq data using in parallel four different methods for back-splice identification. CirComPara also provides quantification of linear RNAs and gene expression, ultimately comparing and correlating circRNA and gene/transcript expression levels. We applied our method to RNA-seq data of monocyte and macrophage samples in relation to haploinsufficiency of the RNA-binding splicing factor Quaking (QKI). The biological relevance of the results, in terms of number, types and variations of circRNAs expressed, illustrates CirComPara potential to enlarge the knowledge of the transcriptome, adding details on the circRNAome, and facilitating further computational and experimental studies. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - In Parkinson’s Disease (PD) there is widespread neuronal loss throughout the brain with pronounced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc, leading to bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. The identification of living dopaminergic neurons in primary Ventral Mesencephalic (VM) cultures using a fluorescent marker provides an alternative way to study the selective vulnerability of these neurons without relying on the immunostaining of fixed cells. Here, we isolate, dissociate, and culture mouse VM neurons for 3 weeks. We then identify dopaminergic neurons in the cultures using eGFP fluorescence (driven by a Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) promoter). Individual neurons are harvested into microcentrifuge tubes using glass micropipettes. Next, we lyse the harvested cells, and conduct cDNA synthesis and transposon-mediated "tagmentation" to produce single cell RNA-Seq libraries1,2,3,4,5. After passing a quality-control check, single-cell libraries are sequenced and subsequent analysis is carried out to measure gene expression. We report transcriptome results for individual dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons isolated from midbrain cultures. We report that 100% of the live TH-eGFP cells that were harvested and sequenced were dopaminergic neurons. These techniques will have widespread applications in neuroscience and molecular biology. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - Background: In gene set analysis, the researchers are interested in determining the gene sets that are significantly correlated with an outcome, e.g. disease status or treatment. With the rapid development of high throughput sequencing technologies, Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an important alternative to traditional expression arrays in gene expression studies. Challenges exist in adopting the existent algorithms to RNA-seq data given the intrinsic difference of the technologies and data. In RNA-seq experiments, the measure of gene expression is correlated with gene length. This inherent correlation may cause bias in gene set analysis. Results: We develop SeqGSA, a new method for gene set analysis with length bias adjustment for RNA-seq data. It extends from the R package GSA designed for microarrays. Our method compares the gene set maxmean statistic against permutations, while also taking into account of the statistics of the other gene sets. To adjust for the gene length bias, we implement a flexible weighted sampling scheme in the restandardization step of our algorithm. We show our method improves the power of identifying significant gene sets that are affected by the length bias. We also show that our method maintains the type I error comparing with another representative method for gene set enrichment test. Conclusions: SeqGSA is a promising tool for testing significant gene pathways with RNA-seq data while adjusting for inherent gene length effect. It enhances the power to detect gene sets affected by the bias and maintains type I error under various situations. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: With the development of high-throughput technology, the researchers can acquire large number of expression data with different types from several public databases. Because most of these data have small number of samples and hundreds or thousands features, how to extract informative features from expression data effectively and robustly using feature selection technique is challenging and crucial. So far, a mass of many feature selection approaches have been proposed and applied to analyse expression data of different types. However, most of these methods only are limited to measure the performances on one single type of expression data by accuracy or error rate of classification. Results: In this article, we propose a hybrid feature selection method based on Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) and evaluate the performance on expression datasets of different types. Firstly, the relevance between features and classifying samples is measured by using the optimizing function of MKL. In this step, an iterative gradient descent process is used to perform the optimization both on the parameters of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and kernel confidence. Then, a set of relevant features is selected by sorting the optimizing function of each feature. Furthermore, we apply an embedded scheme of forward selection to detect the compact feature subsets from the relevant feature set. Conclusions: We not only compare the classification accuracy with other methods, but also compare the stability, similarity and consistency of different algorithms. The proposed method has a satisfactory capability of feature selection for analysing expression datasets of different types using different performance measurements. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Alignment is the first step in most RNA-seq analysis pipelines, and the accuracy of downstream analyses depends heavily on it. Unlike most steps in the pipeline, alignment is particularly amenable to benchmarking with simulated data. We performed a comprehensive benchmarking of 14 common splice-aware aligners for base, read, and exon junction-level accuracy and compared default with optimized parameters. We found that performance varied by genome complexity, and accuracy and popularity were poorly correlated. The most widely cited tool underperforms for most metrics, particularly when using default settings. © 2017 Nature America, inc., part of springer Nature. All rights reserved.

AB  - We have developed a novel analysis method that can interrogate the authenticity of biological samples used for generation of transcriptome profiles in public data repositories. The method uses RNA sequencing information to reveal mutations in expressed transcripts and subsequently confirms the identity of analysed cells by comparison with publicly available cell-specific mutational profiles. Cell lines constitute key model systems widely used within cancer research, but their identity needs to be confirmed in order to minimise the influence of cell contaminations and genetic drift on the analysis. Using both public and novel data, we demonstrate the use of RNA-sequencing data analysis for cell line authentication by examining the validity of COLO205, DLD1, HCT15, HCT116, HKE3, HT29 and RKO colorectal cancer cell lines. We successfully authenticate the studied cell lines and validate previous reports indicating that DLD1 and HCT15 are synonymous. We also show that the analysed HKE3 cells harbour an unexpected KRAS-G13D mutation and confirm that this cell line is a genuine KRAS dosage mutant, rather than a true isogenic derivative of HCT116 expressing only the wild type KRAS. This authentication method could be used to revisit the numerous cell line based RNA sequencing experiments available in public data repositories, analyse new experiments where whole genome sequencing is not available, as well as facilitate comparisons of data from different experiments, platforms and laboratories. © 2017 Fasterius et al.

AB  - With more than 500,000 copies, mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs), a sub-group of SINEs, represent ∼2.5% of the human genome and one of the most numerous family of potential targets for the RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcription machinery. Since MIR elements ceased to amplify ∼130 myr ago, previous studies primarily focused on their genomic impact, while the issue of their expression has not been extensively addressed. We applied a dedicated bioinformatic pipeline to ENCODE RNA-Seq datasets of seven human cell lines and, for the first time, we were able to define the Pol III-driven MIR transcriptome at single-locus resolution. While the majority of Pol III-transcribed MIR elements are cell-specific, we discovered a small set of ubiquitously transcribed MIRs mapping within Pol II-transcribed genes in antisense orientation that could influence the expression of the overlapping gene. We also identified novel Pol III-transcribed ncRNAs, deriving from transcription of annotated MIR fragments flanked by unique MIR-unrelated sequences, and confirmed the role of Pol III-specific internal promoter elements in MIR transcription. Besides demonstrating widespread transcription at these retrotranspositionally inactive elements in human cells, the ability to profile MIR expression at single-locus resolution will facilitate their study in different cell types and states including pathological alterations. © The Author 2016.

AB  - Purpose: Despite various differences, nontranslocation-related sarcomas (e.g., comprising undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma) are unified by their complex genetics. Extensive analysis of the tumor genome using molecular cytogenetic approaches showed many chromosomal gains, losses, and translocations per cell. Genomic quantitative alterations and expression variations have been extensively studied by adapted high-throughput approaches, yet translocations still remained unscreened. We therefore analyzed 117 nontranslocation-related sarcomas by RNA sequencing to identify fusion genes. Experimental design: We performed RNA sequencing and applied a bioinformatics pipeline dedicated to the detection of fusion transcripts. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing were then applied to validate predictions and to search for recurrence and specificity. Results: Among the 6,772 predicted fusion genes, 420 were inframe. One recurrent rearrangement, consistently involving TRIO with various partners, was identified in 5.1% of cases. TRIO translocations are either intrachromosomal with TERT or interchromosomal with LINC01504 or ZNF558. Our results suggest that all translocations led to a truncated TRIO protein either directly or indirectly by alternative splicing. TRIO rearrangement is associated with a modified transcriptomic program to immunity/ inflammation, proliferation and migration, and an increase in proliferation. Conclusions: TRIO fusions have been identified in four different sarcoma histotypes, likely meaning that they are not related to a primary oncogenic event but rather to a secondary one implicated in tumor progression. Moreover, they appear to be specific to nontranslocation-related sarcomas, as no such rearrangement was identified in sarcomas with simple genetics. More cases could lead to a significant association of these fusions to a specific clinical behavior. © 2016 AACR.

AB  - The flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a dicot model organism for research in many aspects of plant biology. A comprehensive annotation of its genome paves the way for understanding the functions and activities of all types of transcripts, including mRNA, the various classes of non-coding RNA, and small RNA. The TAIR10 annotation update had a profound impact on Arabidopsis research but was released more than 5 years ago. Maintaining the accuracy of the annotation continues to be a prerequisite for future progress. Using an integrative annotation pipeline, we assembled tissue-specific RNA-Seq libraries from 113 datasets and constructed 48 359 transcript models of protein-coding genes in eleven tissues. In addition, we annotated various classes of non-coding RNA including microRNA, long intergenic RNA, small nucleolar RNA, natural antisense transcript, small nuclear RNA, and small RNA using published datasets and in-house analytic results. Altogether, we identified 635 novel protein-coding genes, 508 novel transcribed regions, 5178 non-coding RNAs, and 35 846 small RNA loci that were formerly unannotated. Analysis of the splicing events and RNA-Seq based expression profiles revealed the landscapes of gene structures, untranslated regions, and splicing activities to be more intricate than previously appreciated. Furthermore, we present 692 uniformly expressed housekeeping genes, 43% of whose human orthologs are also housekeeping genes. This updated Arabidopsis genome annotation with a substantially increased resolution of gene models will not only further our understanding of the biological processes of this plant model but also of other species. © 2016 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the decline in the glomerular filtration rate is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and thus poses a major challenge for healthcare systems. While the contribution of tissue-derived miRNAs and mRNAs to CKD progression has been extensively studied, little is known about the role of urinary exosomes and their association with CKD. Exosomes are small, membrane-derived endocytic vesicles that contribute to cell-to-cell communication and are present in various body fluids, such as blood or urine. Next-generation sequencing approaches have revealed that exosomes are enriched in noncoding RNAs and thus exhibit great potential for sensitive nucleic acid biomarkers in various human diseases. Therefore, in this study we aimed to identify urinary exosomal ncRNAs as novel biomarkers for diagnosis of CKD. Since up to now most approaches have focused on the class of miRNAs, we extended our analysis to several other noncoding RNA classes, such as tRNAs, tRNA fragments (tRFs), mitochondrial tRNAs, or lincRNAs. For their computational identification from RNA-seq data, we developed a novel computational pipeline, designated as ncRNASeqScan. By these analyses, in CKD patients we identified 30 differentially expressed ncRNAs, derived from urinary exosomes, as suitable biomarkers for early diagnosis. Thereby, miRNA-181a appeared as the most robust and stable potential biomarker, being significantly decreased by about 200-fold in exosomes of CKD patients compared to healthy controls. Using a cell culture system for CKD indicated that urinary exosomes might indeed originate from renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. © 2017 Khurana et al.

AB  - Adaptation of S. cerevisiae to toxic concentrations of manganese provides a physiological model of heavy metal homeostasis. Transcriptome analysis of adapted yeast cells reveals upregulation of cell wall and plasma membrane proteins including membrane transporters. The gene expression in adapted cells differs from that of cells under short-term toxic metal stress. Among the most significantly upregulated genes are PMA2, encoding an ortholog of Pma1 H+-ATPase of the plasma membrane, and YBR056W-A, encoding a putative membrane protein Mnc1 that belongs to the CYSTM family and presumably chelates manganese at the cell surface. We demonstrate that these genes are essential for the adaptation to toxic manganese concentration and propose an extended scheme of manganese detoxification in yeast. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The pattern and rate of genome evolution have profound consequences in organismal evolution. Whole-genome duplication (WGD), or polyploidy, has been recognized as an important evolutionary mechanism of plant diversification. However, in non-model plants the molecular signals of genome duplications have remained largely unexplored. High-throughput transcriptome data from next-generation sequencing have set the stage for novel investigations of genome evolution using new bioinformatic and methodological tools in a phylogenetic framework. Here we compare ten de novo-assembled transcriptomes representing the major lineages of the angiosperm genus Cornus (dogwood) and relevant outgroups using a customized pipeline for analyses. Using three distinct approaches, molecular dating of orthologous genes, analyses of the distribution of synonymous substitutions between paralogous genes, and examination of substitution rates through time, we detected a shared WGD event in the late Cretaceous across all taxa sampled. The inferred doubling event coincides temporally with the paleoclimatic changes associated with the initial divergence of the genus into three major lineages. Analyses also showed an acceleration of rates of molecular evolution after WGD. The highest rates of molecular evolution were observed in the transcriptome of the herbaceous lineage, C. canadensis, a species commonly found at higher latitudes, including the Arctic. Our study demonstrates the value of transcriptome data for understanding genome evolution in closely related species. The results suggest dramatic increase in sea surface temperature in the late Cretaceous may have contributed to the evolution and diversification of flowering plants. © 2017 Yu et al.

AB  - The complexity of the traumatic brain injury (TBI) pathology, particularly concussive injury, is a serious obstacle for diagnosis, treatment, and long-term prognosis. Here we utilize modern systems biology in a rodent model of concussive injury to gain a thorough view of the impact of TBI on fundamental aspects of gene regulation, which have the potential to drive or alter the course of the TBI pathology. TBI perturbed epigenomic programming, transcriptional activities (expression level and alternative splicing), and the organization of genes in networks centered around genes such as Anax2, Ogn, and Fmod. Transcriptomic signatures in the hippocampus are involved in neuronal signaling, metabolism, inflammation, and blood function, and they overlap with those in leukocytes from peripheral blood. The homology between genomic signatures from blood and brain elicited by TBI provides proof of concept information for development of biomarkers of TBI based on composite genomic patterns. By intersecting with human genome-wide association studies, many TBI signature genes and network regulators identified in our rodent model were causally associated with brain disorders with relevant link to TBI. The overall results show that concussive brain injury reprograms genes which could lead to predisposition to neurological and psychiatric disorders, and that genomic information from peripheral leukocytes has the potential to predict TBI pathogenesis in the brain. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) are nonautonomous retrotransposons in the genome of most eukaryotic species. While SINEs have been intensively investigated in humans and other animal systems, SINE identification has been carried out only in a limited number of plant species. This lack of information is apparent especially in non-model plants whose genome has not been sequenced yet. The aim of this work was to produce a specific bioinformatics pipeline for analysing second generation sequence reads of a non-model species and identifying SINEs. We have identified, for the first time, 227 putative SINEs of the olive tree (Olea europaea), that constitute one of the few sets of such sequences in dicotyledonous species. The identified SINEs ranged from 140 to 362 bp in length and were characterised with regard to the occurrence of the tRNA domain in their sequence. The majority of identified elements resulted in single copy or very lowly repeated, often in association with genic sequences. Analysis of sequence similarity allowed us to identify two major groups of SINEs showing different abundances in the olive tree genome, the former with sequence similarity to SINEs of Scrophulariaceae and Solanaceae and the latter to SINEs of Salicaceae. A comparison of sequence conservation between olive SINEs and LTR retrotransposon families suggested that SINE expansion in the genome occurred especially in very ancient times, before LTR retrotransposon expansion, and presumably before the separation of the rosids (to which Oleaceae belong) from the Asterids. Besides providing data on olive SINEs, our results demonstrate the suitability of the pipeline employed for SINE identification. Applying this pipeline will favour further structural and functional analyses on these relatively unknown elements to be performed also in other plant species, even in the absence of a reference genome, and will allow establishing general evolutionary patterns for this kind of repeats in plants. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Efficient diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is met with multiple challenges, calling for a shift of focus from pathogen-centric diagnostics towards identification of host-based multi-marker signatures. Transcriptomics offer a list of differentially expressed genes, but cannot by itself identify the most influential contributors to the disease phenotype. Here, we describe a computational pipeline that adopts an unbiased approach to identify a biomarker signature. Data from RNA sequencing from whole blood samples of TB patients were integrated with a curated genome-wide molecular interaction network, from which we obtain a comprehensive perspective of variations that occur in the host due to TB. We then implement a sensitive network mining method to shortlist gene candidates that are most central to the disease alterations. We then apply a series of filters that include applicability to multiple publicly available datasets as well as additional validation on independent patient samples, and identify a signature comprising 10 genes — FCGR1A, HK3, RAB13, RBBP8, IFI44L, TIMM10, BCL6, SMARCD3, CYP4F3 and SLPI, that can discriminate between TB and healthy controls as well as distinguish TB from latent tuberculosis and HIV in most cases. The signature has the potential to serve as a diagnostic marker of TB. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Germline mutation detection from human DNA sequence data is challenging due to the rarity of such events relative to the intrinsic error rates of sequencing technologies and the uneven coverage across the genome. We developed PhaseByTransmission (PBT) to identify de novo single nucleotide variants and short insertions and deletions (indels) from sequence data collected in parent-offspring trios. We compute the joint probability of the data given the genotype likelihoods in the individual family members, the known familial relationships and a prior probability for the mutation rate. Candidate de novo mutations (DNMs) are reported along with their posterior probability, providing a systematic way to prioritize them for validation. Our tool is integrated in the Genome Analysis Toolkit and can be used together with the ReadBackedPhasing module to infer the parental origin of DNMs based on phase-informative reads. Using simulated data, we show that PBT outperforms existing tools, especially in low coverage data and on the X chromosome. We further show that PBT displays high validation rates on empirical parent-offspring sequencing data for whole-exome data from 104 trios and X-chromosome data from 249 parent-offspring families. Finally, we demonstrate an association between father's age at conception and the number of DNMs in female offspring's X chromosome, consistent with previous literature reports. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Annotation of gene models and transcripts is a fundamental step in genome sequencing projects. Often this is performed with automated prediction pipelines, which can miss complex and atypical genes or transcripts. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data can aid the annotation with empirical data. Here we present de novo transcriptome assemblies generated from RNA-seq data in four Dictyostelid species: D. discoideum, P. pallidum, D. fasciculatum and D. lacteum. The assemblies were incorporated with existing gene models to determine corrections and improvement on a whole-genome scale. This is the first time this has been performed in these eukaryotic species. Results: An initial de novo transcriptome assembly was generated by Trinity for each species and then refined with Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (PASA). The completeness and quality were assessed with the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) and Transrate tools at each stage of the assemblies. The final datasets of 11,315-12,849 transcripts contained 5,610-7,712 updates and corrections to >50% of existing gene models including changes to hundreds or thousands of protein products. Putative novel genes are also identified and alternative splice isoforms were observed for the first time in P. pallidum, D. lacteum and D. fasciculatum. Conclusions: In taking a whole transcriptome approach to genome annotation with empirical data we have been able to enrich the annotations of four existing genome sequencing projects. In doing so we have identified updates to the majority of the gene annotations across all four species under study and found putative novel genes and transcripts which could be worthy for follow-up. The new transcriptome data we present here will be a valuable resource for genome curators in the Dictyostelia and we propose this effective methodology for use in other genome annotation projects. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important in various biological processes, but very few studies on lncRNA have been conducted in birds. To identify IncRNAs expressed during feather development, we analyzed single-stranded RNA-seq (ssRNA-seq) data from the anterior and posterior dorsal regions during zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) embryonic development. Using published transcriptomic data, we further analyzed the evolutionary conservation of IncRNAs in birds and amniotes. Results: A total of 1,081 lncRNAs, including 965 intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), 59 intronic lncRNAs, and 57 antisense lncRNAs (lncNATs), were identified using our newly developed pipeline. These avian IncRNAs share similar characteristics with lncRNAs in mammals, such as shorter transcript length, lower exon number, lower average expression level and less sequence conservation than mRNAs. However, the proportion of lncRNAs overlapping with transposable elements in birds is much lower than that in mammals. We predicted the functions of IncRNAs based on the enriched functions of co-expressed protein-coding genes. Clusters of lncRNAs associated with natal down development were identified. The sequences and expression levels of candidate lncRNAs that shared conserved sequences among birds were validated by qPCR in both zebra finch and chicken. Finally, we identified three highly conserved lncRNAs that may be associated with natal down development. Conclusions: Our study provides the first systematical identification of avian lncRNAs using ssRNA-seq analysis and offers a resource of embryonically expressed lncRNAs in zebra finch. We also predicted the biological function of identified lncRNAs. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Cell-to-cell heterogeneity is a major driver of cancer evolution, progression, and emergence of drug resistance. Epigenomic variation at the single-cell level can rapidly create cancer heterogeneity but is difficult to detect and assess functionally. Results: We develop a strategy to bridge the gap between measurement and function in single-cell epigenomics. Using single-cell chromatin accessibility and RNA-seq data in K562 leukemic cells, we identify the cell surface marker CD24 as co-varying with chromatin accessibility changes linked to GATA transcription factors in single cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of CD24 high versus low cells prospectively isolated GATA1 and GATA2 high versus low cells. GATA high versus low cells express differential gene regulatory networks, differential sensitivity to the drug imatinib mesylate, and differential self-renewal capacity. Lineage tracing experiments show that GATA/CD24hi cells have the capability to rapidly reconstitute the heterogeneity within the entire starting population, suggesting that GATA expression levels drive a phenotypically relevant source of epigenomic plasticity. Conclusion: Single-cell chromatin accessibility can guide prospective characterization of cancer heterogeneity. Epigenomic subpopulations in cancer impact drug sensitivity and the clonal dynamics of cancer evolution. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Latest Next Generation Sequencing technologies opened the way to a novel era of genomic studies, allowing to gain novel insights into multifactorial pathologies as cancer. In particular gene fusion detection and comprehension have been deeply enhanced by these methods. However, state of the art algorithms for gene fusion identification are still challenging. Indeed, they identify huge amounts of poorly overlapping candidates and all the reported fusions should be considered for in lab validation clearly overwhelming wet lab capabilities. Results: In this work we propose a novel methodological approach and tool named FuGePrior for the prioritization of gene fusions from paired-end RNA-Seq data. The proposed pipeline combines state of the art tools for chimeric transcript discovery and prioritization, a series of filtering and processing steps designed by considering modern literature on gene fusions and an analysis on functional reliability of gene fusion structure. Conclusions:FuGePrior performance has been assessed on two publicly available paired-end RNA-Seq datasets: The first by Edgren and colleagues includes four breast cancer cell lines and a normal breast sample, whereas the second by Ren and colleagues comprises fourteen primary prostate cancer samples and their paired normal counterparts. FuGePrior results accounted for a reduction in the number of fusions output of chimeric transcript discovery tools that ranges from 65 to 75% depending on the considered breast cancer cell line and from 37 to 65% according to the prostate cancer sample under examination. Furthermore, since both datasets come with a partial validation we were able to assess the performance of FuGePrior in correctly prioritizing real gene fusions. Specifically, 25 out of 26 validated fusions in breast cancer dataset have been correctly labelled as reliable and biologically significant. Similarly, 2 out of 5 validated fusions in prostate dataset have been recognized as priority by FuGePrior tool. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Transcriptome interpretation relies on a good-quality reference transcriptome for accurate quantification of gene expression as well as functional analysis of genetic variants. The current annotation of the horse genome lacks the specificity and sensitivity necessary to assess gene expression especially at the isoform level, and suffers from insufficient annotation of untranslated regions (UTR) usage. We built an annotation pipeline for horse and used it to integrate 1.9 billion reads from multiple RNA-seq data sets into a new refined transcriptome. Results: This equine transcriptome integrates eight different tissues from 59 individuals and improves gene structure and isoform resolution, while providing considerable tissue-specific information. We utilized four levels of transcript filtration in our pipeline, aimed at producing several transcriptome versions that are suitable for different downstream analyses. Our most refined transcriptome includes 36,876 genes and 76,125 isoforms, with 6474 candidate transcriptional loci novel to the equine transcriptome. Conclusions: We have employed a variety of descriptive statistics and figures that demonstrate the quality and content of the transcriptome. The equine transcriptomes that are provided by this pipeline show the best tissue-specific resolution of any equine transcriptome to date and are flexible for several downstream analyses. We encourage the integration of further equine transcriptomes with our annotation pipeline to continue and improve the equine transcriptome. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Recent advances in genomics methodologies, in particular the availability of next-generation sequencing approaches have made it possible to identify risk loci throughout the genome, in particular the exome. In the current study, we present findings from an exome study conducted in five affected individuals of a multiplex family with cleft palate only. Methods: The GEnome MINIng (GEMINI) pipeline was used to functionally annotate the single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions. Filtering methods were applied to identify variants that are clinically relevant and present in affected individuals at minor allele frequencies (≥1%) in the 1000 Genomes Project single nucleotide polymorphism database, Exome Aggregation Consortium, and Exome Variant Server databases. The bioinformatics tool Systems Tool for Craniofacial Expression-Based Gene Discovery was used to prioritize cleft candidates in our list of variants, and Sanger sequencing was used to validate the presence of identified variants in affected and unaffected relatives. Results: Our analyses approach narrowed the candidates down to the novel missense variant in ARHGAP29 (GenBank: NM_004815.3, NP_004806.3;c.1654T>C [p.Ser552Pro]. A functional assay in zebrafish embryos showed that the encoded protein lacks the activity possessed by its wild-type counterpart, and migration assays revealed that keratinocytes transfected with wild-type ARHGAP29 migrated faster than counterparts transfected with the p.Ser552Pro ARHGAP29 variant or empty vector (control). Conclusion: These findings reveal ARHGAP29 to be a regulatory protein essential for proper development of the face, identifies an amino acid that is key for this, and provides a potential new diagnostic tool. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Understanding how complex tissues are formed, maintained, and regenerated through local growth, differentiation, and remodeling requires knowledge on how single-cell behaviors are coordinated on the population level. The self-renewing hair follicle, maintained by a distinct stem cell population, represents an excellent paradigm to address this question. A major obstacle in mechanistic understanding of hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) regulation has been the lack of a culture system that recapitulates HFSC behavior while allowing their precise monitoring and manipulation. Here, we establish an in vitro culture system based on a 3D extracellular matrix environment and defined soluble factors, which for the first time allows expansion and long-term maintenance of murine multipotent HFSCs in the absence of heterologous cell types. Strikingly, this scheme promotes de novo generation of HFSCs from non-HFSCs and vice versa in a dynamic self-organizing process. This bidirectional interconversion of HFSCs and their progeny drives the system into a population equilibrium state. Our study uncovers regulatory dynamics by which phenotypic plasticity of cells drives population-level homeostasis within a niche, and provides a discovery tool for studies on adult stem cell fate. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Background: Various insect species have been added to genomic databases over the years. Thus, researchers can easily obtain online genomic information on invertebrates and insects. However, many incorrectly annotated genes are included in these databases, which can prevent the correct interpretation of subsequent functional analyses. To address this problem, we used a combination of dry and wet bench processes to select functional genes from public databases. Results: Enolase is an important glycolytic enzyme in all organisms. We used a combination of dry and wet bench processes to identify functional enolases in the silkworm Bombyx mori (BmEno). First, we detected five annotated enolases from public databases using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) search, and then through cDNA cloning, Northern blotting, and RNA-seq analysis, we revealed three functional enolases in B. mori: BmEno1, BmEno2, and BmEnoC. BmEno1 contained a conserved key amino acid residue for metal binding and substrate binding in other species. However, BmEno2 and BmEnoC showed a change in this key amino acid. Phylogenetic analysis showed that BmEno2 and BmEnoC were distinct from BmEno1 and other enolases, and were distributed only in lepidopteran clusters. BmEno1 was expressed in all of the tissues used in our study. In contrast, BmEno2 was mainly expressed in the testis with some expression in the ovary and suboesophageal ganglion. BmEnoC was weakly expressed in the testis. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the mRNA expression of BmEno2 and BmEnoC correlated with testis development; thus, BmEno2 and BmEnoC may be related to lepidopteran-specific spermiogenesis. Conclusions: We identified and characterized three functional enolases from public databases with a combination of dry and wet bench processes in the silkworm B. mori. In addition, we determined that BmEno2 and BmEnoC had species-specific functions. Our strategy could be helpful for the detection of minor genes and functional genes in non-model organisms from public databases. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Stem cell treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are expected to reach clinical trials soon. Most of the approaches currently under development involve transplantation of immature progenitors that subsequently undergo phenotypic and functional maturation in vivo, and predicting the long-term graft outcome already at the progenitor stage remains a challenge. Here, we took an unbiased approach to identify predictive markers expressed in dopamine neuron progenitors that correlate with graft outcome in an animal model of Parkinson's disease through gene expression analysis of >30 batches of grafted human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived progenitors. We found that many of the commonly used markers did not accurately predict in vivo subtype-specific maturation. Instead, we identified a specific set of markers associated with the caudal midbrain that correlate with high dopaminergic yield after transplantation in vivo. Using these markers, we developed a good manufacturing practice (GMP) differentiation protocol for highly efficient and reproducible production of transplantable dopamine progenitors from hESCs. © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Targeted resequencing offers a cost-effective alternative to whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing when investigating regions known to be associated with a trait or disease. There are a number of approaches to targeted resequencing, including microfluidic PCR amplification, which may be enhanced by multiplex PCR. Currently, there is no open-source software that can design next-generation multiplex PCR experiments that ensures primers are unique at a genome-level and efficiently pools compatible primers. Results: We present MPD, a software package that automates the design of multiplex PCR primers for next-generation sequencing. The core of MPD is implemented in C for speed and uses a hashed genome to ensure primer uniqueness, avoids placing primers over sites of known variation, and efficiently pools compatible primers. A JavaScript web application (http://multiplexprimer.io) utilizing the MPD Perl package provides a convenient platform for users to make designs. Using a realistic set of genes identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we achieve 90% coverage of all exonic regions using stringent design criteria. Using the first 47 primer pools for wet-lab validation, we sequenced ~25Kb at 99.7% completeness with a mean coverage of 300X among 313 samples simultaneously and identified 224 variants. The number and nature of variants we observe are consistent with high quality sequencing. Conclusions: MPD can successfully design multiplex PCR experiments suitable for next-generation sequencing, and simplifies retooling targeted resequencing pipelines to focus on new targets as new genetic evidence emerges. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used in a range of biomedical studies. Nonetheless, current RNA-seq analysis tools are not specifically designed to efficiently process scRNA-seq data due to their limited scalability. Here we introduce Falco, a cloud-based framework to enable paralellization of existing RNA-seq processing pipelines using big data technologies of Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark for performing massively parallel analysis of large scale transcriptomic data. Using two public scRNA-seq datasets and two popular RNA-seq alignment/feature quantification pipelines, we show that the same processing pipeline runs 2.6-145.4 times faster using Falco than running on a highly optimized standalone computer. Falco also allows users to utilize low-cost spot instances of Amazon Web Services, providing a ∼65% reduction in cost of analysis. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Given that the majority of multi-exon genes generate diverse functional products, it is important to evaluate expression at the isoformlevel. Previous studies have demonstrated strong gene-level correlations between RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) andmicroarray platforms, but have not studied their concordance at the isoform level. We performed transcript abundance estimation on raw RNA-seq and exon-array expression profiles available for common glioblastoma multiforme samples fromThe Cancer Genome Atlas using different analysis pipelines, and compared both the isoform- and gene-level expression estimates between programs and platforms. The results showed better concordance between RNA-seq/exon-array and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) platforms for fold change estimates than for raw abundance estimates, suggesting that fold change normalization against a control is an important step for integrating expression data across platforms. Based on RT-qPCR validations, eXpress and Multi-Mapping Bayesian Gene eXpression (MMBGX) programs achieved the best performance for RNA-seq and exon-array platforms, respectively, for deriving the isoform-level fold change values. While eXpress achieved the highest correlation with the RT-qPCR and exon-array (MMBGX) results overall, RSEM wasmore highly correlated with MMBGX for the subset of transcripts that are highly variable across the samples. Express appears to be most successful in discriminating lowly expressed transcripts, but IsoformEx and RSEM correlate more strongly with MMBGX for highly expressed transcripts. The results also reinforce how potentially important isoform-level expression changes can bemasked by gene-level estimates, and demonstrate that exon arrays yield comparable results to RNA-seq for evaluating isoform-level expression changes. © 2016.

AB  - The development of High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) for RNA profiling (RNA-seq) has shed light on the diversity of transcriptomes. While RNA-seq is becoming a de facto standard for monitoring the population of expressed transcripts in a given condition at a specific time, processing the huge amount of data it generates requires dedicated bioinformatics programs. Here, we describe a standard bioinformatics protocol using state-of-the-art tools, the STAR mapper to align reads onto a reference genome, Cufflinks to reconstruct the transcriptome, and RSEM to quantify expression levels of genes and transcripts. We present the workflow using human transcriptome sequencing data from two biological replicates of the K562 cell line produced as part of the ENCODE3 project. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2017.

AB  - Background. De novo transcriptome assembly of short reads is now a common step in expression analysis of organisms lacking a reference genome sequence. Several software packages are available to perform this task. Even if their results are of good quality it is still possible to improve them in several ways including redundancy reduction or error correction. Trinity and Oases are two commonly used de novo transcriptome assemblers. The contig sets they produce are of good quality. Still, their compaction (number of contigs needed to represent the transcriptome) and their quality (chimera and nucleotide error rates) can be improved. Results. We built a de novo RNA-Seq Assembly Pipeline (DRAP) which wraps these two assemblers (Trinity and Oases) in order to improve their results regarding the above-mentioned criteria. DRAP reduces from 1.3 to 15 fold the number of resulting contigs of the assemblies depending on the read set and the assembler used. This article presents seven assembly comparisons showing in some cases drastic improvements when using DRAP. DRAP does not significantly impair assembly quality metrics such are read realignment rate or protein reconstruction counts. Conclusion. Transcriptome assembly is a challenging computational task even if good solutions are already available to end-users, these solutions can still be improved while conserving the overall representation and quality of the assembly. The de novo RNA-Seq Assembly Pipeline (DRAP) is an easy to use software package to produce compact and corrected transcript set.

AB  - Identifying variants from RNA-seq (transcriptome sequencing) data is a cost-effective and versatile alternative to whole-genome sequencing. However, current variant callers do not generally behave well with RNA-seq data due to reads encompassing intronic regions. We have developed a software programme called Opossum to address this problem. Opossum pre-processes RNA-seq reads prior to variant calling, and although it has been designed to work specifically with Platypus, it can be used equally well with other variant callers such as GATK HaplotypeCaller. In this work, we show that using Opossum in conjunction with either Platypus or GATK HaplotypeCaller maintains precision and improves the sensitivity for SNP detection compared to the GATK Best Practices pipeline. In addition, using it in combination with Platypus offers a substantial reduction in run times compared to the GATK pipeline so it is ideal when there are only limited time or computational resources available. © 2017 Oikkonen L and Lise S.

AB  - Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a very valuable resource to understand the evolutionary history of poorly known species. However, in organisms with large genomes, as most amphibians, WGS is still excessively challenging and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) represents a cost-effective tool to explore genome-wide variability. Nonmodel organisms do not usually have a reference genome and the transcriptome must be assembled de-novo. We used RNA-seq to obtain the transcriptomic profile for Oreobates cruralis, a poorly known South American direct-developing frog. In total, 550,871 transcripts were assembled, corresponding to 422,999 putative genes. Of those, we identified 23,500, 37,349, 38,120 and 45,885 genes present in the Pfam, EggNOG, KEGG and GO databases, respectively. Interestingly, our results suggested that genes related to immune system and defense mechanisms are abundant in the transcriptome of O. cruralis. We also present a pipeline to assist with pre-processing, assembling, evaluating and functionally annotating a de-novo transcriptome from RNA-seq data of non-model organisms. Our pipeline guides the inexperienced user in an intuitive way through all the necessary steps to build de-novo transcriptome assemblies using readily available software and is freely available at: https://github.com/biomendi/TRANSCRIPTOME-ASSEMBLY-PIPELINE/wiki. © 2017 Montero-Mendieta et al.

AB  - Recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible to measure RNA expression at the singlecell level, thus paving the way for exploring expression heterogeneity among individual cells. Current single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocols are complex and introduce technical biases that vary across cells, which can bias downstream analysis without proper adjustment. To account for cell-Tocell technical differences, we propose a statistical framework, TASC (Toolkit for Analysis of Single Cell RNA-seq), an empirical Bayes approach to reliably model the cell-specific dropout rates and amplification bias by use of external RNA spike-ins. TASC incorporates the technical parameters, which reflect cell-To-cell batch effects, into a hierarchical mixture model to estimate the biological variance of a gene and detect differentially expressed genes. More importantly, TASC is able to adjust for covariates to further eliminate confounding that may originate from cell size and cell cycle differences. In simulation and real scRNA-seq data, TASC achieves accurate Type I error control and displays competitive sensitivity and improved robustness to batch effects in differential expression analysis, compared to existing methods. TASC is programmed to be computationally efficient, taking advantage of multi-Threaded parallelization. We believe that TASC will provide a robust platform for researchers to leverage the power of scRNA-seq. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically relies on reconstructing transcripts or counting reads that overlap known gene structures. We previously introduced an intermediate statistical approach called differentially expressed region (DER) finder that seeks to identify contiguous regions of the genome showing differential expression signal at single base resolution without relying on existing annotation or potentially inaccurate transcript assembly. We present the derfinder software that improves our annotation-agnostic approach to RNA-seq analysis by: (i) implementing a computationally efficient bump-hunting approach to identify DERs that permits genome-scale analyses in a large number of samples, (ii) introducing a flexible statistical modeling framework, including multi-group and time-course analyses and (iii) introducing a new set of data visualizations for expressed region analysis. We apply this approach to public RNA-seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and BrainSpan project to show that derfinder permits the analysis of hundreds of samples at base resolution in R, identifies expression outside of known gene boundaries and can be used to visualize expressed regions at base-resolution. In simulations, our base resolution approaches enable discovery in the presence of incomplete annotation and is nearly as powerful as feature-level methods when the annotation is complete. derfinder analysis using expressed region-level and single base-level approaches provides a compromise between full transcript reconstruction and feature-level analysis. The package is available from Bioconductor at www.bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder. © The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.

AB  - Background. RNA-seq is a useful tool for analysis of gene expression. However, its robustness is greatly affected by a number of artifacts. One of them is the presence of duplicated reads. Results. To infer the influence of different methods of removal of duplicated reads on estimation of gene expression in cancer genomics, we analyzed paired samples of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-tumor liver tissue. Four protocols of data analysis were applied to each sample: processing without deduplication, deduplication using a method implemented in samtools, and deduplication based on one or two molecular indices (MI).Wealso analyzed the influence of sequencing layout (single read or paired end) and read length. We found that deduplication without MI greatly affects estimated expression values; this effect is the most pronounced for highly expressed genes. Conclusion. The use of unique molecular identifiers greatly improves accuracy of RNA-seq analysis, especially for highly expressed genes. We developed a set of scripts that enable handling of MI and their incorporation into RNA-seq analysis pipelines. Deduplication without MI affects results of differential gene expression analysis, producing a high proportion of false negative results. The absence of duplicate read removal is biased towards false positives. In those cases where using MI is not possible, we recommend using paired-end sequencing layout. © 2017 Klepikova et al.

AB  - Motivation Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows whole transcriptome profiling of thousands of individual cells, enabling the molecular exploration of tissues at the cellular level. Such analytical capacity is of great interest to many research groups in the world, yet these groups often lack the expertise to handle complex scRNA-seq datasets. Results We developed a fully integrated, web-based platform aimed at the complete analysis of scRNA-seq data post genome alignment: From the parsing, filtering and normalization of the input count data files, to the visual representation of the data, identification of cell clusters, differentially expressed genes (including cluster-specific marker genes), and functional gene set enrichment. This Automated Single-cell Analysis Pipeline (ASAP) combines a wide range of commonly used algorithms with sophisticated visualization tools. Compared with existing scRNA-seq analysis platforms, researchers (including those lacking computational expertise) are able to interact with the data in a straightforward fashion and in real time. Furthermore, given the overlap between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq analysis workflows, ASAP should conceptually be broadly applicable to any RNA-seq dataset. As a validation, we demonstrate how we can use ASAP to simply reproduce the results from a single-cell study of 91 mouse cells involving five distinct cell types.

AB  - Transcriptome resources for social insects have the potential to provide new insight into polyphenism, i.e., how divergent phenotypes arise from the same genome. Here we present a transcriptome based on paired-end RNA sequencing data for the ant Formica exsecta (Formicidae, Hymenoptera). The RNA sequencing libraries were constructed from samples of several life stages of both sexes and female castes of queens and workers, in order to maximize representation of expressed genes. We first compare the performance of common assembly and scaffolding software (Trinity, Velvet-Oases, and SOAPdenovo-trans), in producing de novo assemblies. Second, we annotate the resulting expressed contigs to the currently published genomes of ants, and other insects, including the honeybee, to filter genes that have annotation evidence of being true genes. Our pipeline resulted in a final assembly of altogether 39,262 mRNA transcripts, with an average coverage of > 300X, belonging to 17,496 unique genes with annotation in the related ant species. From these genes, 536 genes were unique to one caste or sex only, highlighting the importance of comprehensive sampling. Our final assembly also showed expression of several splice variants in 6,975 genes, and we show that accounting for splice variants affects the outcome of downstream analyses such as gene ontologies. Our transcriptome provides an outstanding resource for future genetic studies on F. exsecta and other ant species, and the presented transcriptome assembly can be adapted to any non-model species that has genomic resources available from a related taxon. © 2017 Dhaygude et al.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) belong to a recently re-discovered species of RNA thatemerge during RNA maturation through a process called back-splicing. A downstream50 splice site is linked to an upstream 30 splice site to form a circular transcript insteadof a canonical linear transcript. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS)have brought circRNAs back into the focus of many scientists. Since then, severalstudies reported that circRNAs are differentially expressed across tissue types anddevelopmental stages, implying that they are actively regulated and not merely a by-product of splicing. Though functional studies have shown that some circRNAs couldact as miRNA-sponges, the function of most circRNAs remains unknown. To expandour understanding of possible roles of circular RNAs, we propose a new pipeline thatcould fully characterizes candidate circRNA structure from RNAseq data- FUCHS:FUll CHaracterization of circular RNA using RNA-Sequencing. Currently, mostcomputational prediction pipelines use back-spliced reads to identify circular RNAs.FUCHS extends this concept by considering all RNA-seq information from long reads(typically>150 bp) to learn more about the exon coverage, the number of double breakpoint fragments, the different circular isoforms arising from one host-gene, and thealternatively spliced exons within the same circRNA boundaries. This new knowledgewill enable the user to carry out differential motif enrichment and miRNA seed analysisto determine potential regulators during circRNA biogenesis. FUCHS is an easy-to-usePython based pipeline that contributes a new aspect to the circRNA research. © 2017 Metge et al.

AB  - RNA microarrays and RNA-seq are nowadays standard technologies to study the transcriptional activity of cells. Most studies focus on tracking transcriptional changes caused by specific experimental conditions. Information referring to genes up- and downregulation is evaluated analyzing the behaviour of relatively large population of cells by averaging its properties. However, even assuming perfect sample homogeneity, different subpopulations of cells can exhibit diverse transcriptomic profiles, as they may follow different regulatory/signaling pathways. The purpose of this study is to provide a novel methodological scheme to account for possible internal, functional heterogeneity in homogeneous cell lines, including cancer ones. We propose a novel computational method to infer the proportion between subpopulations of cells that manifest various functional behaviour in a given sample. Our method was validated using two datasets from RNA microarray experiments. Both experiments aimed to examine cell viability in specific experimental conditions. The presented methodology can be easily extended to RNA-seq data as well as other molecular processes. Moreover, it complements standard tools to indicate most important networks from transcriptomic data and in particular could be useful in the analysis of cancer cell lines affected by biologically active compounds or drugs. © 2017 Krzysztof Gogolewski et al.

AB  - Sequencing technologies have made considerable advancements. From the Sanger sequencing method to the next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods, and from the NGS methods to the third-generation sequencing methods, we can see the development thread of the sequencing technology. Currently, NGS is the main contender in the sequencing market. NGS technologies provide an opportunity to research the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in detail. The NGS platforms have their own special characteristics, but share some main ideas. DNA sequencing via NGS is fundamental for RNA sequencing and miRNA sequencing. MiRNA sequencing has special characteristics. The pipeline of miRNA sequencing by NGS is explained in detail from the wet experiment to the dry experiment. © Springer Science+Business Media LLC 2017.

AB  - Motivation The identification of genetic variants influencing gene expression (known as expression quantitative trait loci or eQTLs) is important in unravelling the genetic basis of complex traits. Detecting multiple eQTLs simultaneously in a population based on paired DNA-seq and RNA-seq assays employs two competing types of models: Models which rely on appropriate transformations of RNA-seq data (and are powered by a mature mathematical theory), or count-based models, which represent digital gene expression explicitly, thus rendering such transformations unnecessary. The latter constitutes an immensely popular methodology, which is however plagued by mathematical intractability. Results We develop tractable count-based models, which are amenable to efficient estimation through the introduction of latent variables and the appropriate application of recent statistical theory in a sparse Bayesian modelling framework. Furthermore, we examine several transformation methods for RNA-seq read counts and we introduce arcsin, logit and Laplace smoothing as preprocessing steps for transformation-based models. Using natural and carefully simulated data from the 1000 Genomes and gEUVADIS projects, we benchmark both approaches under a variety of scenarios, including the presence of noise and violation of basic model assumptions. We demonstrate that an arcsin transformation of Laplace-smoothed data is at least as good as state-of-the-art models, particularly at small samples. Furthermore, we show that an over-dispersed Poisson model is comparable to the celebrated Negative Binomial, but much easier to estimate. These results provide strong support for transformation-based versus count-based (particularly Negative-Binomial-based) models for eQTL mapping.

Most of these packages search for enriched signatures amongst differentially regulated genes to reveal higher level biological themes that may be missed when focusing only on evidence from individual genes. With so many different methods on offer, choosing the best algorithm and visualization approach can be challenging. The EGSEA package solves this problem by combining results from up to 12 prominent gene set testing algorithms to obtain a consensus ranking of biologically relevant results.This workflow demonstrates how EGSEA can extend limma-based differential expression analyses for RNA-seq and microarray data using experiments that profile 3 distinct cell populations important for studying the origins of breast cancer. Following data normalization and set-up of an appropriate linear model for differential expression analysis, EGSEA builds gene signature specific indexes that link a wide range of mouse or human gene set collections obtained from MSigDB, GeneSetDB and KEGG to the gene expression data being investigated. EGSEA is then configured and the ensemble enrichment analysis run, returning an object that can be queried using several S4 methods for ranking gene sets and visualizing results via heatmaps, KEGG pathway views, GO graphs, scatter plots and bar plots. Finally, an HTML report that combines these displays can fast-track the sharing of results with collaborators, and thus expedite downstream biological validation. EGSEA is simple to use and can be easily integrated with existing gene expression analysis pipelines for both human and mouse data. © 2017 Alhamdoosh M et al.

AB  - The recently introduced Kallisto pseudoaligner has radically simplified the quantification of transcripts in RNA-sequencing experiments. We offer cloud-scale RNAseq pipelines Arkas-Quantification, which deploys Kallisto for parallel cloud computations, and Arkas-Analysis, which annotates the Kallisto results by extracting structured information directly from source FASTA files with per-contig metadata and calculates the differential expression and gene-set enrichment analysis on both coding genes and transcripts. The biologically informative downstream gene-set analysis maintains special focus on Reactome annotations while supporting ENSEMBL transcriptomes. The Arkas cloud quantification pipeline includes support for custom user-uploaded FASTA files, selection for bias correction and pseudoBAM output. The option to retain pseudoBAM output for structural variant detection and annotation provides a middle ground between de novo transcriptome assembly and routine quantification, while consuming a fraction of the resources used by popular fusion detection pipelines. Illumina's BaseSpace cloud computing environment, where these two applications are hosted, offers a massively parallel distributive quantification step for users where investigators are better served by cloud-based computing platforms due to inherent efficiencies of scale. © 2017 Colombo AR et al.

AB  - Background: Reliable exon recognition is key to the splicing of pre-mRNAs into mature mRNAs. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein whose nuclear loss and cytoplasmic aggregation are a hallmark pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). TDP-43 depletion causes the aberrant inclusion of cryptic exons into a range of transcripts, but their extent, relevance to disease pathogenesis and whether they are caused by other RNA-binding proteins implicated in ALS/FTD are unknown. Methods: We developed an analysis pipeline to discover and quantify cryptic exon inclusion and applied it to publicly available human and murine RNA-sequencing data. Results: We detected widespread cryptic splicing in TDP-43 depletion datasets but almost none in another ALS/FTD-linked protein FUS. Sequence motif and iCLIP analysis of cryptic exons demonstrated that they are bound by TDP-43. Unlike the cryptic exons seen in hnRNP C depletion, those repressed by TDP-43 cannot be linked to transposable elements. Cryptic exons are poorly conserved and inclusion overwhelmingly leads to nonsense-mediated decay of the host transcript, with reduced transcript levels observed in differential expression analysis. RNA-protein interaction data on 73 different RNA-binding proteins showed that, in addition to TDP-43, 7 specifically bind TDP-43 linked cryptic exons. This suggests that TDP-43 competes with other splicing factors for binding to cryptic exons and can repress cryptic exon inclusion. Conclusions: Our quantitative analysis pipeline confirms the presence of cryptic exons during the depletion of TDP-43 but not FUS providing new insight into to RNA-processing dysfunction as a cause or consequence in ALS/FTD. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Metavisitor is a software package that allows biologists and clinicians without specialized bioinformatics expertise to detect and assemble viral genomes from deep sequence datasets. The package is composed of a set of modular bioinformatic tools and workflows that are implemented in the Galaxy framework. Using the graphical Galaxy workflow editor, users with minimal computational skills can use existing Metavisitor workflows or adapt them to suit specific needs by adding or modifying analysis modules. Metavisitor works with DNA, RNA or small RNA sequencing data over a range of read lengths and can use a combination of de novo and guided approaches to assemble genomes from sequencing reads. We show that the software has the potential for quick diagnosis as well as discovery of viruses from a vast array of organisms. Importantly, we provide here executable Metavisitor use cases, which increase the accessibility and transparency of the software, ultimately enabling biologists or clinicians to focus on biological or medical questions. © 2017 Carissimo et al.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in human cancers. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that both 5p-arm and 3p-arm of mature miRNAs could be expressed from the same precursor and we further interrogated the 5p-arm and 3p-arm miRNA expression with a comprehensive arm feature annotation list. To assist biologists to visualize the differential 5p-arm and 3p-arm miRNA expression patterns, we utilized a user-friendly mobile App to display. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) miRNA-Seq expression information. We have collected over 4,500 miRNA-Seq datasets from 15 TCGA cancer types and further processed them with the 5p-arm and 3p-arm annotation analysis pipeline. In order to be displayed with the RNA-Seq Viewer App, annotated 5p-arm and 3p-arm miRNA expression information and miRNA gene loci information were converted into SQLite tables. In this distinct application, for any given miRNA gene, 5p-arm miRNA is illustrated on the top of chromosome ideogram and 3p-arm miRNA is illustrated on the bottom of chromosome ideogram. Users can then easily interrogate the differentially 5p-arm/3p-arm expressed miRNAs with their mobile devices. This study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of RNA-Seq Viewer App in addition to mRNA-Seq data visualization. © 2017 Chao-Yu Pan et al.

AB  - Studies in epigenetics have shown that DNA methylation is a key factor in regulating gene expression. Aberrant DNA methylation is often associated with DNA instability, which could lead to development of diseases such as cancer. DNA methylation typically occurs in CpG context. When located in a gene promoter, DNA methylation often acts to repress transcription and gene expression. The most commonly used technology of studying DNA methylation is bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq), which can be used to measure genomewide methylation levels on the single-nucleotide scale. Notably, BS-seq can also be combined with enrichment strategies, such as reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), to target CpG-rich regions in order to save per-sample costs. A typical DNA methylation analysis involves identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between different experimental conditions. Many statistical methods have been developed for finding DMRs in BS-seq data. In this workflow, we propose a novel approach of detecting DMRs using edgeR. By providing a complete analysis of RRBS profiles of epithelial populations in the mouse mammary gland, we will demonstrate that differential methylation analyses can be fit into the existing pipelines specifically designed for RNA-seq differential expression studies. In addition, the edgeR generalized linear model framework offers great flexibilities for complex experimental design, while still accounting for the biological variability. The analysis approach illustrated in this article can be applied to any BS-seq data that includes some replication, but it is especially appropriate for RRBS data with small numbers of biological replicates. © 2017 Chen Y et al.

AB  - The interest in investigating the biological roles of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) is increasing, due to the pleiotropic effects of these molecules exert in many biological contexts. While several methods and tools are available to study microRNAs (miRNAs), only few focus on novel classes of sncRNAs, in particular PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). To overcome these limitations, we implemented iSmaRT (integrative Small RNA Tool-kit), an automated pipeline to analyze smallRNA-Seq data. © The Author 2016.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding RNAs that are involved in a variety of biological processes. The pig is an important farm animal and an ideal biomedical model. In this study, we performed a genome-wide scan for lncRNAs in multiple tissue types from pigs. A total of 118 million paired-end 90 nt clean reads were obtained via strand-specific RNA sequencing, 80.4% of which were aligned to the pig reference genome. We developed a stringent bioinformatics pipeline to identify 2,139 high-quality multiexonic lncRNAs. The characteristic analysis revealed that the novel lncRNAs showed relatively shorter transcript length, fewer exons, and lower expression levels in comparison with protein-coding genes (PCGs). The guanine-cytosine (GC) content of the protein-coding exons and introns was significantly higher than that of the lncRNAs. Moreover, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density of lncRNAs was significantly higher than that of PCGs. Conservation analysis revealed that most lncRNAs were evolutionarily conserved among pigs, humans, and mice, such as CUFF.253988.1, which shares homology with human long noncoding RNA MALAT1. The findings of our study significantly increase the number of known lncRNAs in pigs. © 2017 Yalan Yang et al.

AB  - Intermolecular interactions of ncRNAs are at the core of gene regulation events, and identifying the full map of these interactions bears crucial importance for ncRNA functional studies. It is known that RNA- RNA interactions are built up by complementary base pairings between interacting RNAs and high level of complementarity between two RNA sequences is a powerful predictor of such interactions. Here, we present RIsearch2, a large-scale RNA-RNA interaction prediction tool that enables quick localization of potential near-complementary RNA-RNA interactions between given query and target sequences. In contrast to previous heuristics which either search for exact matches while including G-U wobble pairs or employ simplified energy models, we present a novel approach using a single integrated seed-andextend framework based on suffix arrays. RIsearch2 enables fast discovery of candidate RNA-RNA interactions on genome/transcriptome-wide scale. We furthermore present an siRNA off-target discovery pipeline that not only predicts the off-target transcripts but also computes the off-targeting potential of a given siRNA. This is achieved by combining genome-wide RIsearch2 predictions with target site accessibilities and transcript abundance estimates. We show that this pipeline accurately predicts siRNA off-target interactions and enables offtargeting potential comparisons between different siRNA designs. RIsearch2 and the siRNA off-target discovery pipeline are available as stand-alone software packages from http://rth.dk/resources/risearch. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Modern genome sequencing strategies are highly sensitive to contamination making the detection of foreign DNA sequences an important part of analysis pipelines. Here we use Taxoblast, a simple pipeline with a graphical user interface, for the post-assembly detection of contaminating sequences in the published genome of the kelp Saccharina japonica. Analyses were based on multiple blastn searches with short sequence fragments. They revealed a number of probable bacterial contaminations as well as hybrid scaffolds that contain both bacterial and algal sequences. This or similar types of analysis, in combination with manual curation, may thus constitute a useful complement to standard bioinformatics analyses prior to submission of genomic data to public repositories. © 2017 Dittami and Corre.

AB  - Summary: Advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing have enabled more efficient detection of fusion transcripts, but the technology and associated software used for fusion detection from sequencing data often yield a high false discovery rate. Good prioritization of the results is important, and this can be helped by a visualization framework that automatically integrates RNA data with known genomic features. Here we present chimeraviz, a Bioconductor package that automates the creation of chimeric RNA visualizations. The package supports input from nine different fusion-finder tools: deFuse, EricScript, InFusion, JAFFA, FusionCatcher, FusionMap, PRADA, SOAPfuse and STAR-FUSION. Availability and implementation: chimeraviz is an R package available via Bioconductor (https://bio conductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/chimeraviz.html) under Artistic-2.0. Source code and support is available at GitHub (https://github.com/stianlagstad/chimeraviz). © 2017 The Author.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases worldwide. Recent studies have indicated that fish oil supplementation has benefits against NAFLD. Our previous transcriptomic study has validated the effect of fish oil supplementation on altering hepatic gene expression in a NAFLD rat model. In the current study, we examined the effects of fish oil on the expression of hepatic microRNAs. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with a lab chow (CON), high-fat high-cholesterol diet (WD), or WD supplemented with fish oil (FOH), respectively. Small RNAs were extracted from livers for RNA-sequencing. A total of 79 miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) between FOH and WD groups, exemplified by rno-miR-29c-3p, rno-miR-30d-5p, rno-miR-33-5p, rno-miR-34a, and rno-miR-328a-3p. Functional annotation of DEMs predicted target genes suggested that the altered hepatic miRNAs contributed to fish oil modification of hepatic lipid metabolism and signaling transduction. Integrative analysis of DEMs and differentially expressed genes suggested that the expression difference of Pcsk9, Insig2, Per3, and Socs1/3 between FOH and WD groups may be due to miRNA modification. Our study reveals that fish oil supplementation alters hepatic expression of miRNAs, which may contribute to fish oil amelioration of NAFLD in rats. © 2017 Hualin Wang et al.

AB  - Paternal contributions to the zygote are thought to extend beyond delivery of the genome and paternal RNAs have been linked to epigenetic transgenerational inheritance in different species. In addition, sperm-egg fusion activates several downstream processes that contribute to zygote formation, including PLC zeta-mediated egg activation and maternal RNA clearance. Since a third of the preimplantation developmental period in the mouse occurs prior to the first cleavage stage, there is ample time for paternal RNAs or their encoded proteins potentially to interact and participate in early zygotic activities. To investigate this possibility, a bespoke next-generation RNA sequencing pipeline was employed for the first time to characterise and compare transcripts obtained from isolated murine sperm, MII eggs and pre-cleavage stage zygotes. Gene network analysis was then employed to identify potential interactions between paternally and maternally derived factors during the murine egg-to-zygote transition involving RNA clearance, protein clearance and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Our in silico approach looked for factors in sperm, eggs and zygotes that could potentially interact co-operatively and synergistically during zygote formation. At least five sperm RNAs (Hdac11, Fbxo2, Map1lc3a, Pcbp4 and Zfp821) met these requirements for a paternal contribution, which with complementary maternal co-factors suggest a wider potential for extra-genomic paternal involvement in the developing zygote. © 2017 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.

AB  - Motivation: Deep sequencing based ribosome footprint profiling can provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of protein translation. However, the observed ribosome profile is fundamentally confounded by transcriptional activity. In order to decipher principles of translation regulation, tools that can reliably detect changes in translation efficiency in case-control studies are needed. Results: We present a statistical framework and an analysis tool, RiboDiff, to detect genes with changes in translation efficiency across experimental treatments. RiboDiff uses generalized linear models to estimate the over-dispersion of RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling measurements separately, and performs a statistical test for differential translation efficiency using both mRNA abundance and ribosome occupancy. © The Author 2016.

AB  - To address the poor prognosis of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (iALL), we generated a panel of cell lines from primary patient samples and investigated cytotoxic responses to contemporary and novel Food and Drug Administration-approved chemotherapeutics. To characterize representation of primary disease within cell lines, molecular features were compared using RNA-sequencing and cytogenetics. High-throughput screening revealed variable efficacy of currently used drugs, however identified consistent efficacy of three novel drug classes: proteasome inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Gene expression of drug targets was highly reproducible comparing iALL cell lines to matched primary specimens. Histone deacetylase inhibitors, including romidepsin (ROM), enhanced the activity of a key component of iALL therapy, cytarabine (ARAC) in vitro and combined administration of ROM and ARAC to xenografted mice further reduced leukemia burden. Molecular studies showed that ROM reduces expression of cytidine deaminase, an enzyme involved in ARAC deactivation, and enhances the DNA damage-response to ARAC. In conclusion, we present a valuable resource for drug discovery, including the first systematic analysis of transcriptome reproducibility in vitro, and have identified ROM as a promising therapeutic for MLL-rearranged iALL. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Cis- and trans-regulatory mutations are important contributors to transcriptome evolution. Quantifying their relative contributions to intraspecific variation in gene expression is essential for understanding the population genetic processes that underlie evolutionary changes in gene expression. Here, we have examined this issue by quantifying genome-wide, allele-specific expression (ASE) variation using a crossing scheme that produces F1 hybrids between 18 different Drosophila melanogaster strains sampled from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel and a reference strain from another population. Head and body samples from F1 adult females were subjected to RNA sequencing and the subsequent ASE quantification. Cis- and trans-regulatory effects on expression variation were estimated from these data. A higher proportion of genes showed significant cis-regulatory variation (~28%) than those that showed significant trans-regulatory variation (~9%). The sizes of cis-regulatory effects on expression variation were 1.98 and 1.88 times larger than trans-regulatory effects in heads and bodies, respectively. A generalized linear model analysis revealed that both cis-and trans-regulated expression variation was strongly associated with nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity and tissue specificity. Interestingly, trans-regulated variation showed a negative correlation with local recombination rate. Also, our analysis on proximal transposable element (TE) insertions suggested that they affect transcription levels of ovary-expressed genes more pronouncedly than genes not expressed in the ovary, possibly due to defense mechanisms against TE mobility in the germline. Collectively, our detailed quantification of ASE variations from a natural population has revealed a number of new relationships between genomic factors and the effects of cis- and trans-regulatory factors on expression variation. © 2017 by the Genetics Society of America.

AB  - Background. In recent years, next generation high throughput sequencing technologies have proven to be useful tools for investigations concerning the genomics or transcriptomics also of non-model species. Consequently, ornithologists have adopted these technologies and the respective bioinformatics tools to survey the genomes and transcriptomes of a few avian non-model species. The Common Blackbird is one of the most common bird species living in European cities, which has successfully colonized urban areas and for which no reference genome or transcriptome is publicly available. However, to target questions like genome wide gene expression analysis, a reference genome or transcriptome is needed. Methods. Therefore, in this study two Common Blackbirds were sacrificed, their mRNA was isolated and analyzed by RNA-Seq to de novo assemble a transcriptome and characterize it. Illumina reads (125 bp paired-end) and a Velvet/Oases pipeline led to 162,158 transcripts. For the annotation (using BlastC), an unfiltered protein database was used. SNPs were identified using SAMtools and BCFtools. Furthermore, mRNA from three single tissues (brain, heart and liver) of the same two Common Blackbirds were sequenced by Illumina (75 bp single-end reads). The draft transcriptome and the three single tissues were compared by their BLAST hits with the package VennDiagram in R. Results. Following the annotation against protein databases, we found evidence for 15,580 genes in the transcriptome (all well characterized hits after annotation). On 18% of the assembled transcripts, 144,742 SNPs were identified which are, consequently, 0.09% of all nucleotides in the assembled transcriptome. In the transcriptome and in the single tissues (brain, heart and liver), 10,182 shared genes were found. Discussion. Using a next-generation technology and bioinformatics tools, we made a first step towards the genomic investigation of the Common Blackbird. The de novo assembled transcriptome is usable for downstream analyses such as differential gene expression analysis and SNP identification. This study shows the importance of the approach to sequence single tissues to understand functions of tissues, proteins and the phenotype. © 2017 Koglin et al.

AB  - A major bottleneck for metagenomic sequencing is rapid and efficient DNA extraction. Here, we compare the extraction efficiencies of three magnetic bead-based platforms (KingFisher, epMotion, and Tecan) to a standardized column-based extraction platform across a variety of sample types, including feces, oral, skin, soil, and water. Replicate sample plates were extracted and prepared for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in parallel to assess extraction bias and DNA quality. The data demonstrate that any effect of extraction method on sequencing results was small compared with the variability across samples; however, the KingFisher platform produced the largest number of high-quality reads in the shortest amount of time. Based on these results, we have identified an extraction pipeline that dramatically reduces sample processing time without sacrificing bacterial taxonomic or abundance information. © 2017 Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

AB  - Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterial pathogen responsible for Lyme disease, modulates its gene expression profile in response to the environments encountered throughout its tick-mammal infectious cycle. To begin to characterize the B. burgdorferi transcriptome during murine infection, we previously employed an in vivo expression technology-based approach (BbIVET). This identified 233 putative promoters, many of which mapped to un-annotated regions of the complex, segmented genome. Herein, we globally identify the 5′ end transcriptome of B. burgdorferi grown in culture as a means to validate non-ORF associated promoters discovered through BbIVET. We demonstrate that 119 BbIVET promoters are associated with transcription start sites (TSSs) and validate novel RNA transcripts using Northern blots and luciferase promoter fusions. Strikingly, 49% of BbIVET promoters were not found to associate with TSSs. This finding suggests that these sequences may be primarily active in the mammalian host. Furthermore, characterization of the 6042 B. burgdorferi TSSs reveals a variety of RNAs including numerous antisense and intragenic transcripts, leaderless RNAs, long untranslated regions and a unique nucleotide frequency for initiating intragenic transcription. Collectively, this is the first comprehensive map of TSSs in B. burgdorferi and characterization of previously un-annotated RNA transcripts expressed by the spirochete during murine infection. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - The annotation of genomes from NGS platforms needs to be automated and fully integrated. However, maintaining consistency and accuracy in genome annotation is a challenging problem because millions of protein database entries are not assigned reliable functions. This shortcoming limits the knowledge that can be extracted from genomes and metabolic models. Launched in 2005, the MicroScope platform (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope) is an integrative resource that supports systematic and efficient revision of microbial genome annotation, data management and comparative analysis. Effective comparative analysis requires a consistent and complete view of biological data, and therefore, support for reviewing the quality of functional annotation is critical. MicroScope allows users to analyze microbial (meta)genomes together with post-genomic experiment results if any (i.e. transcriptomics, resequencing of evolved strains, mutant collections, phenotype data). It combines tools and graphical interfaces to analyze genomes and to perform the expert curation of gene functions in a comparative context. Starting with a short overview of the MicroScope system, this paper focuses on some major improvements of the Web interface, mainly for the submission of genomic data and on original tools and pipelines that have been developed and integrated in the platform: computation of pan-genomes and prediction of biosynthetic gene clusters. Today the resource contains data for more than 6000 microbial genomes, and among the 2700 personal accounts (65% of which are now from foreign countries), 14% of the users are performing expert annotations, on at least a weekly basis, contributing to improve the quality of microbial genome annotations. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological disease. The pathophysiological mechanisms of SCI have been reported to be relevant to central nervous system injury such as brain injury. In this study, gene expression of the brain after SCI was elucidated using transcriptome analysis to characterize the temporal changes in global gene expression patterns in a SCI mouse model. Subjects were randomly classified into 3 groups: sham control, acute (3 h post-injury), and subacute (2 wk post-injury) groups. We sought to confirm the genes differentially expressed between post-injured groups and sham control group. Therefore, we performed transcriptome analysis to investigate the enriched pathways associated with pathophysiology of the brain after SCI using Database for Annotation Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), which yielded Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. Following enriched pathways were found in the brain: oxidative phosphorylation pathway; inflammatory response pathways—cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathway; and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related pathways—antigen processing and presentation and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Oxidative phosphorylation pathway was identified at acute phase, while inflammation response and ER stress-related pathways were identified at subacute phase. Since the following pathways—oxidative phosphorylation pathway, inflammatory response pathways, and ER stress-related pathways—have been well known in the SCI, we suggested a link between SCI and brain injury. These mechanisms provide valuable reference data for better understanding pathophysiological processes in the brain after SCI. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - ThaleMine (https://apps.araport.org/thalemine/) is a comprehensive data warehouse that integrates a wide array of genomic information of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The data collection currently includes the latest structural and functional annotation from the Araport1 1 update, the Col-0 genome sequence, RNA-seq and array expression, co-expression, protein interactions, homologs, pathways, publications, alleles, germplasm and phenotypes. The data are collected from a wide variety of public resources. Users can browse gene-specific data through Gene Report pages, identify and create gene lists based on experiments or indexed keywords, and run GO enrichment analysis to investigate the biological significance of selected gene sets. Developed by the Arabidopsis Information Portal project (Araport, https://www.araport.org/), ThaleMine uses the InterMine software framework, which builds well-structured data, and provides powerful data query and analysis functionality. The warehoused data can be accessed by users via graphical interfaces, as well as programmatically via web-services. Here we describe recent developments in ThaleMine including new features and extensions, and discuss future improvements. InterMine has been broadly adopted by the model organism research community including nematode, rat, mouse, zebrafish, budding yeast, the modENCODE project, as well as being used for human data. ThaleMine is the first InterMine developed for a plant model. As additional new plant InterMines are developed by the legume and other plant research communities, the potential of cross-organism integrative data analysis will be further enabled. © The Author 2016.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 18–24 nucleotides non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by post-transcriptional suppression of mRNA. The Chinese giant salamander (CGS, Andrias davidianus), which is an endangered species, has become one of the important models of animal evolution; however, no miRNA studies on this species have been conducted. In this study, two small RNA libraries of CGS ovary and testis were constructed using deep sequencing technology. A bioinformatics pipeline was developed to distinguish miRNA sequences from other classes of small RNAs represented in the sequencing data. We found that many miRNAs and other small RNAs such as piRNA and tsRNA were abundant in CGS tissue. A total of 757 and 756 unique miRNAs were annotated as miRNA candidates in the ovary and testis respectively. We identified 145 miRNAs in CGS ovary and 155 miRNAs in CGS testis that were homologous to those in Xenopus laevis ovary and testis respectively. Forty-five miRNAs were more highly expressed in ovary than in testis and 21 miRNAs were more highly expressed in testis than in ovary. The expression profiles of the selected miRNAs (miR-451, miR-10c, miR-101, miR-202, miR-7a and miR-499) had their own different roles in other eight tissues and different development stages of testis and ovary, suggesting that these miRNAs play vital regulatory roles in sexual differentiation, gametogenesis and development in CGS. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal miRNA profiles that are related to male and female CGS gonads and provide insights into sex differences in miRNA expression in CGS. © 2017 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.

AB  - Altered gastric accommodation and intestinal morphology suggest impaired gastrointestinal (GI) transit may occur in the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat strain, as common in stress-associated functional GI disorders. Because changes in GI transit can alter microbiota composition, we investigated whether these are altered in WKY rats compared with the resilient Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats under basal conditions and characterized plasma lipid and metabolite differences. Bead transit was tracked by X-ray imaging to monitor gastric emptying (4 h), small intestine (SI) transit (9 h), and large intestine transit (12 h). Plasma extracts were analyzed by lipid and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cecal microbial composition was determined by Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis using the QIIME pipeline. Stomach retention of beads was 77% for WKY compared with 35% for SD rats. GI transit was decreased by 34% (9 h) and 21% (12 h) in WKY compared with SD rats. Excluding stomach retention, transiting beads moved 29% further along the SI over 4–9 h for WKY compared with SD rats. Cecal Ruminococcus, Roseburia, and unclassified Lachnospiraceae genera were less abundant in WKY rats, whereas the minor taxa Dorea, Turicibacter, and Lactobacillus were higher. Diglycerides, triglycerides, phosphatidyl-ethanolamines, and phosphatidylserine were lower in WKY rats, whereas cholesterol esters and taurocholic acids were higher. The unexpected WKY rat phenotype of delayed gastric emptying, yet rapid SI transit, was associated with altered lipid and metabolite profiles. The delayed gastric emptying of the WKY phenotype suggests this rat strain may be useful as a model for gastroparesis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study reveals that the stress-prone Wistar-Kyoto rat strain has a baseline physiology of gastroparesis and rapid small intestine transit, together with metabolic changes consistent with lipid metabolism-associated dysbiosis, compared with nonstress-prone rats. This suggests that the Wistar-Kyoto rat strain may be an appropriate animal model for gastroparesis. © the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for analyzing environmental DNA and provides the comprehensive molecular view of microbial communities. For obtaining the copy number of particular sequences in the NGS library, however, additional quantitative analysis as quantitative PCR (qPCR) or digital PCR (dPCR) is required. Furthermore, number of sequences in a sequence library does not always reflect the original copy number of a target gene because of biases caused by PCR amplification, making it difficult to convert the proportion of particular sequences in the NGS library to the copy number using the mass of input DNA. To address this issue, we applied stochastic labeling approach with random-tag sequences and developed a NGS-based quantification protocol, which enables simultaneous sequencing and quantification of the targeted DNA. This quantitative sequencing (qSeq) is initiated from single-primer extension (SPE) using a primer with random tag adjacent to the 5′ end of target-specific sequence. During SPE, each DNA molecule is stochastically labeled with the random tag. Subsequently, first-round PCR is conducted, specifically targeting the SPE product, followed by second-round PCR to index for NGS. The number of random tags is only determined during the SPE step and is therefore not affected by the two rounds of PCR that may introduce amplification biases. In the case of 16S rRNA genes, after NGS sequencing and taxonomic classification, the absolute number of target phylo-types 16S rRNA gene can be estimated by Poisson statistics by counting random tags incorporated at the end of sequence. To test the feasibility of this approach, the 16S rRNA gene of Sulfolobus tokodaii was subjected to qSeq, which resulted in accurate quantification of 5.0 × 103 to 5.0 × 104 copies of the 16S rRNA gene. Furthermore, qSeq was applied to mock microbial communities and environmental samples, and the results were comparable to those obtained using digital PCR and relative abundance based on a standard sequence library. We demonstrated that the qSeq protocol proposed here is advantageous for providing less-biased absolute copy numbers of each target DNA with NGS sequencing at one time. By this new experiment scheme in microbial ecology, microbial community compositions can be explored in more quantitative manner, thus expanding our knowledge of microbial ecosystems in natural environments. © 2017 Hoshino, Inagaki.

AB  - Rapid advancements in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, coupled with the dramatic decrease in cost, have made NGS one of the leading approaches applied in cancer research. In addition, it is increasingly used in clinical practice for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Somatic (cancer-only) single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions (indels) are the simplest classes of mutation, however, their identifcation in whole exome sequencing data is complicated by germline polymorphisms, tumor heterogeneity and errors in sequencing and analysis. An increasing number of software and methodological guidelines are being published for the analysis of sequencing data. Usually, the algorithms of MuTect, VarScan and Genome Analysis Toolkit are applied to identify the variants. However, one of these algorithms alone results in incomplete genomic information. To address this issue, the present study developed a systematic pipeline for analyzing the whole exome sequencing data of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a combination of the three algorithms, named the three-caller pipeline. Application of the three-caller pipeline to the whole exome data of HCC, improved the detection of true positive mutations and a total of 75 tumor-specifc somatic variants were identifed. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the mutations in the genes encoding cell adhesion and regulation of Ras GTPase activity. This pipeline provides an effective approach to identify variants from NGS data for subsequent functional analyses.

AB  - High-throughput next-generation sequencing is a powerful tool to identify the genotypic landscapes of somatic variants and therapeutic targets in various cancers including gastric cancer, forming the basis for personalized medicine in the clinical setting. Although the advent of many computational algorithms leads to higher accuracy in somatic variant calling, no standard method exists due to the limitations of each method. Here, we constructed a new pipeline. We combined two different somatic variant callers with different algorithms, Strelka and VarScan 2, and evaluated performance using whole exome sequencing data obtained from 19 Japanese cases with gastric cancer (GC); then, we characterized these tumors based on identified driver molecular alterations. More single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions were detected by Strelka and VarScan 2, respectively. SNVs detected by both tools showed higher accuracy for estimating somatic variants compared with those detected by only one of the two tools and accurately showed the mutation signature and mutations of driver genes reported for GC. Our combinatorial pipeline may have an advantage in detection of somatic mutations in GC and may be useful for further genomic characterization of Japanese patients with GC to improve the efficacy of GC treatments. © 2017, University of Tokushima.

AB  - Worldwide, hundreds of thousands of humans have had their genomes or exomes sequenced, and access to the resulting data sets can provide valuable information for variant interpretation and understanding gene function. Here, we present a lightweight, flexible browser framework to display large population datasets of genetic variation. We demonstrate its use for exome sequence data from 60 706 individuals in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). The ExAC browser provides geneand transcript-centric displays of variation, a critical view for clinical applications. Additionally, we provide a variant display, which includes population frequency and functional annotation data as well as short read support for the called variant. This browser is open-source, freely available at http://exac.broadinstitute.org, and has already been used extensively by clinical laboratories worldwide. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Motivation: Whole exome and gene panel sequencing are increasingly used for oncological diagnostics. To investigate the accuracy of SCNA detection algorithms on simulated and clinical tumor samples, the precision and sensitivity of four SCNA callers were measured using 50 simulated whole exome and 50 simulated targeted gene panel datasets, and using 119 TCGA tumor samples for which SNP array data were available. Results: On synthetic exome and panel data, VarScan2 mostly called false positives, whereas Control-FREEC was precise (>90% correct calls) at the cost of low sensitivity (<40% detected). ONCOCNV was slightly less precise on gene panel data, with similarly low sensitivity. This could be explained by low sensitivity for amplifications and high precision for deletions. Surprisingly, these results were not strongly affected by moderate tumor impurities; only contaminations with more than 60% non-cancerous cells resulted in strongly declining precision and sensitivity. On the 119 clinical samples, both Control-FREEC and CNVkit called 71.8% and 94%, respectively, of the SCNAs found by the SNP arrays, but with a considerable amount of false positives (precision 29% and 4.9%). Discussion: Whole exome and targeted gene panel methods by design limit the precision of SCNA callers, making them prone to false positives. SCNA calls cannot easily be integrated in clinical pipelines that use data from targeted capture-based sequencing. If used at all, they need to be cross-validated using orthogonal methods.

AB  - Deep phenotyping has been defined as the precise and comprehensive analysis of phenotypic abnormalities in which the individual components of the phenotype are observed and described. The three components of the Human PhenotypeOntology (HPO; www.human-phenotype-ontology.org) project are the phenotype vocabulary, disease-phenotype annotations and the algorithms that operate on these. These components are being used for computational deep phenotyping and precision medicine as well as integration of clinical data into translational research. The HPO is being increasingly adopted as a standard for phenotypic abnormalities by diverse groups such as international rare disease organizations, registries, clinical labs, biomedical resources, and clinical software tools and will thereby contribute toward nascent efforts at global data exchange for identifying disease etiologies. This update article reviews the progress of the HPO project since the debut Nucleic Acids Research database article in 2014, including specific areas of expansion such as common (complex) disease, new algorithms for phenotype driven genomic discovery and diagnostics, integration of cross-species mapping efforts with the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, an improved quality control pipeline, and the addition of patient-friendly terminology. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - The aim of this study was to design a road map for personalizing cancer therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using molecular pattern diagnostics. As an exploratory study, we investigated molecular patterns of tissues of two tumors from individual HCC patients, which in previous experiments had shown contrasting reactions to the phase 2 transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 inhibitor galunisertib. Cancer-driving molecular patterns encompass - inter alias - altered transcription profiles and somatic mutations in coding regions differentiating tumors from their respective peritumoral tissues and from each other. Massive analysis of cDNA ends and all-exome sequencing demonstrate a highly divergent transcriptional and mutational landscape, respectively, for the two tumors, that offers potential explanations for the tumors contrasting responses to galunisertib. Molecular pattern diagnostics (MPDs) suggest alternative, individual-tumor-specific therapies, which in both cases deviate from the standard sorafenib treatment and from each other. Suggested personalized therapies use kinase inhibitors and immunefocused drugs as well as low-toxicity natural compounds identified using an advanced bioinformatics routine included in the MPD protocol. The MPD pipeline we describe here for the prediction of suitable drugs for treatment of two contrasting HCCs may serve as a blueprint for the design of therapies for various types of cancer. © The Author(s) 2017.
